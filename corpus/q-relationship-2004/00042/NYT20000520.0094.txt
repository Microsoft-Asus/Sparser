BEIJING --
The Clinton administration has argued that Congress should vote for normal trade relations with China because it is in the United States ' national security interest , strengthening reformist forces in China .
And the vast majority of influential Chinese agree .
These Chinese say their country is at a tipping point in its history : A yes vote on normal trade could propel it forward to greater liberalization and engagement with the West .
A no vote from Congress would be seen as a slap in the face , throwing China back into conservatism and anti- American hatred .
`` What 's important is not how this vote will affect this or that industry , '' said Zhou Daichun , a commercial lawyer in Beijing .
`` What 's important is that this is an opportunity to push for reform and reorganization in China , and without that impetus many reforms are impossible . ''
`` If China is refused , it will give encouragement to conservatives here , '' he said .
`` And if you think about the reaction to the embassy bombing last year -- and how much the bombing affected Zhu Rongji -- you can imagine how serious that could be , '' he added , alluding to the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade , Yugoslavia , last year , which reduced the influence of China 's Western -leaning prime minister and created virulent anti- Americanism .
For millions of Chinese , the congressional vote -- which , if positive , would ensure China 's full participation in the World Trade Organization -- has taken on an aura that transcends the boundaries of trade and politics .
A broad array of influential Chinese -- top government officials , publishers , bankers , artists , lawyers and pro-democracy advocates -- have come together in extraordinary agreement on the issue , investing their hope for progress in China in a contentious trade vote occurring 10,000 miles away .
Trade experts say the implementation of agreements in China is likely to be slow and difficult .
But Chinese government leaders and economists hope the normalization of trade with the United States will help close inefficient state enterprises .
Authors and artists here are convinced it will reduce censorship .
Lawyers suggest it will force China 's mercurial judges to follow the law .
`` For China , joining WTO is not just about trade concessions , '' said Xu Xiaonian , a financial analyst at China Investment Construction Corp. `` There is much , much more at stake . ''
The people who have the most at stake are some of China 's top leaders -- President Jiang Zemin and Zhu , the country 's chief proponent of the trade deal .
Both have long campaigned for closer economic ties with the United States , a position that became much more controversial in China after last year 's embassy bombing , which the United States has said was accidental .
These leaders want to open the Chinese market through the World Trade Organization , in part to attract new investment .
But also they are counting on international trading rules and the pressure from increased foreign competition to force forward the government 's stalled economic reform plans -- from closing bankrupt factories to breaking up state monopolies and phasing out state housing .
While Zhu believes that such reforms are essential , they have proved politically difficult and the government is far behind schedule .
Local industries have resisted downsizing and giving up state perks .
Huge state businesses , like China Telecom , have refused to cede an ounce of power .
Jiang and Zhu are personally vulnerable , too , since they have pushed the trade pact despite the misgivings of internal opponents , who remain suspicious of the United States or who worry that competition will cause destabilizing unemployment in China 's state industries .
And if Congress snubs China , it will seriously weaken both their policies and their standing , injecting new tension into Chinese - American relations .
`` If the vote does n't pass , that will be a disaster for Jiang and Zhu since they are the main architects of the current foreign and economic policies , and these both depend on getting PNTR , '' or permanent normal trade relations , said a senior researcher at a government policy institute here .
`` If they fail , they will have a tough task persuading ministries , provincial leaders and the military to go along with their reforms -- especially the military , who believe that China has been too soft on the U.S. and on Taiwan . ''
Senior U.S. officials say that a no vote would have long-term repercussions , forcing a quick end to Zhu 's career , and making it harder for Jiang to anoint a like-minded successor when he steps down as head of the party in 2002 .
But in Beijing , when people sit at Starbucks discussing the U.S. trade bill , it is not the fate of the party -- or even business -- that is the focus of concern .
In fact , many people who have never agreed with China 's leaders find themselves similarly invested in China 's trade status .
`` Of course I support WTO , and of course this will be a very , very big thing here , '' said Zhang Yuan , a successful film director .
Zhang , whose work includes a current hit and several prior movies that have been banned , said he hoped for `` more creative space '' and less interference from government censors .
`` For one thing , it will open doors to more investment into cinemas and the film industry , and that 's good , '' he said .
And he predicted that joining the world trade body would `` push the leadership to relax its restrictions on subject matter '' so that Chinese films could compete with the influx from Hollywood .
Even those normally at odds with the government appreciate the trade deal , convinced that the U.S. pork -- cars and dollars that are expected to flow into China if the trade vote passes -- will bring with it greater appreciation for liberal ideals .
`` WTO membership might not serve to invoke a democratic breakthrough immediately , but it will certainly make Chinese people exposed as never before to liberal values and democratic institutions , '' said Liu Junning , who was recently fired from his job at the Chinese Academy of Social Science for his reformist political stance .
`` Opening up is sometimes more important than reform for China . ''
And in the past 20 years , Chinese have seen how economics can drive vast social change .
Most Chinese are infinitely freer than a decade ago -- to travel , to make work choices , even to joke about the government -- even though the Communist Party has maintained a political monopoly .
`` The transformation of the economy that started in the 1980s has had all sorts of political and cultural effects in the last decade , and that 's true despite 1989 and the lack of significant political reform , '' said Zhang , the director , referring to the year when the government violently suppressed demonstrations in Tiananmen Square .
A commitment to the World Trade Organization will set off a new round of social and political changes , experts here say .
`` The political and social effects will be much more immediate than the economic , said Yan Xuetong , a researcher at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations .
In state sectors like banking , insurance and telecommunication , which would all have to open up to foreign companies , managers would have to change their practices in order to survive , often with an extended ripple effect .
Banks would have to come up with better loan programs to help the poor with college tuition , and factories would have to honor contracts that are now routinely breached .
But Yan said the biggest boon would be less tangible , `` changing people 's attitudes and their psychology in important and positive ways . ''
In some areas -- like law -- the link between joining the world trade body and social change is quite direct .
Zhou , the lawyer , said he likes to think of WTO membership as `` reformatting '' Chinese business and legal culture .
He said that many offices in China , including the trademark bureau , are run according to internal regulations that are not publicly available .
But , he predicted , if China enters the World Trade Organization , `` disputes like this will be solved by the courts , not by bureaucratic means . ''
`` The agreement will affect not just trade law and copyright law but also civil and criminal procedure laws , '' he said .
`` Entry into WTO will help clean up and regularize the legislative and judicial systems . ''
In other areas , the influence will be more subtle .
An Dun , a best-selling author and journalist , welcomes the trade bill for the increased copyright protection it will bring to a country where pirated books and compact discs generally outnumber legitimate ones .
But An , who has at times clashed with authorities over her frank discussion of teen-age pregnancies , infidelity and prostitution , said she also has a larger hope : that joining the world economic community will lead to greater freedom of speech , so that she can write some books she still dares not write today .
`` Of course the structure of publishing ca n't change quickly , because publishers are controlled by the state , '' she said , sipping tea in a stylish suit , about to fly off on a national book tour .
`` But the control is a deep thing , partly in people 's minds .
And with more intellectual commerce between China and the West , people 's thoughts and concepts can change . ''
She and others predicted that more liberal trade practices might induce the government to adopt a new publishing law that would permit private publishers , albeit with some restrictions -- a proposal that has been circulating in government circles for several years .
Despite their nearly boundless hope for the trade deal , most informed Chinese acknowledge that it will also mean considerable economic pain .
Indeed , many people in and out of the government see the trade deal as a kind of tough love that will help the central government make the difficult changes that it is unable or unwilling to make by itself .
`` Today there is no leader like Deng Xiaoping , and the leadership must strike a balance between different political groups , '' said Xu , the financial analyst .
`` They lack the power to overcome the resistance of groups who are hurt by reform and that 's why globalization has been slowing down , like a train losing steam .
`` The leaders are counting on outside forces , on global competition , to overcome that resistance and push the transformation of the economy .
And they are willing to risk higher unemployment and instability in the short term for economic efficiency and growth in the long run , as they see few other ways . ''
With hopes running so high and a new deal between China and the European Union now sealed , a no vote from Congress would be emotionally devastating , experts say .
`` Because this agreement is so good for us , they would not see rejection of this trade measure as just an act of Congress , but as a major restatement of policy -- a declaration that we see them as the enemy , '' said Sandy Berger , President Clinton 's national security adviser .
`` The consequences could be enormous . ''
The shock will be greatly magnified because the Chinese media have not said much about the heated debates in the United States , featuring mostly supporters instead .
Even many well-informed Chinese never understood that passage was in doubt .
`` If China does n't get PNTR , people will regard it as American hostility to China , '' said Yan Xuetong .
`` Even though they know the administration has to get the support of Congress , since the American political system is so different from ours , it 's hard for them to understand . ''
