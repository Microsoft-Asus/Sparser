JERUSALEM , September 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A U.S. Jewish leader has questioned whether anti- Semitism is behind the U.S. State Department 's suspension of the security clearance of U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk .
`` First of all he is a political appointee .
Secondly , he does n't come from the community of State Department officials , he comes from outside .
And thirdly , he is a Jew , '' said Abe Foxman , national director of the U.S. Anti - Defamation League .
`` And until I see other people in the same situation , I have to ask the question , '' Foxman told Israel 's Army Radio on Sunday The U.S. State Department suspended Indyk 's security clearance , requiring him to stay in the United States , pending the findings of an FBI investigation into alleged security violations .
Indyk is being questioned after he was found doing highly classified work on his unclassified government laptop computer .
The State Department said Indyk had `` cooperated fully '' with it and FBI .
There was no espionage involved or compromising of intelligence , but rather a case in which the security procedures were not followed .
Indyk remains as the ambassador to Israel but his position will be filled temporarily by his charge d 'affaires Bob Simons .
The FBI investigation reportedly began in April when a State Department laptop computer containing top-secret information about arms proliferation disappeared .
The computer , though not linked to Indyk , prompted a probe by the State Department personnel into the use of such computers .
The investigation was said to have reached a critical stage while Indyk was in Washington this month to help President Bill Clinton assess the state of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians .
Analysts here have not ruled out the possibility that Indyk might be a victim of power struggle between the Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. prior to the presidential election , as the State Department is the target the Republicans are aiming for .
Israeli officials have defended the 49-year -old London -born and Australian -reared Jew , who has long been involved in the Middle East peacemaking .
They have expressed concerns that his absence would affect U.S. efforts to forge a final peace between Israel and the Palestinians at the critical and sensitive stage of the peace talks .
`` I hope it wo n't make it harder , '' acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami told the army radio .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Saturday praised Indyk for his contribution to the peace process and hoped that the investigation will be completed as quickly as possible , and that Indyk will continue to actively contribute to the peace process .
Barak 's spokesman said on Sunday that Israel considered the investigation `` an internal American matter . ''
