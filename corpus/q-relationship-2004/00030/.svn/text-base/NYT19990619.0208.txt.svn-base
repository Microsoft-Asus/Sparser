WASHINGTON --
Democrats are moving to capitalize immediately on the failure of the Republican -controlled House to pass even modest gun-control legislation , and promising to take the issue to the forefront of the 2000 presidential campaign .
In a short , blistering radio address delivered Saturday from Europe , President Clinton took the House and the National Rifle Association to task and set the tone for the coming campaign .
`` Time and again , the gun lobby has used every weapon in its arsenal to defeat any effort to strengthen our gun laws , no matter how sensible , '' Clinton said .
`` The House of Representatives gutted our bill in the dark of night -- literally , after midnight -- because the gun lobby did n't want common-sense gun legislation to see the light of day , '' Clinton said .
`` That is unacceptable .
We ca n't allow the gun lobby to rewrite our laws and undermine our values . ''
Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey , the two rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination , also excoriated Republicans for the House 's failure .
But it was mostly Democrats who killed the final package , saying that it was too watered down to be effective and that they did not want to give the Republicans bragging rights for passing even modest gun-control measures .
Republicans say that Democrats killed the package so that they could exploit the gun issue both in the presidential campaign and in their eagerness to try to win back control of the House .
Wayne LaPierre , the rifle association 's executive vice president , said the bill 's defeat was a victory for freedom , and vowed that the organization 's fight would continue .
`` Ultimately it 's going to go on to the 2000 election , the most important election in the history of this country , '' LaPierre said in a videotaped statement for the organization 's Web page .
`` And we 're going to be there in every district in every state to make sure that freedom comes out on top . ''
Gore and Bradley were campaigning in California , a state where shootings over the last several years have increased sentiment for restrictions on firearms .
`` What is the Congress doing ? ''
Gore asked incredulously .
`` Why do n't they just wake up and respond to what the American people want ? ''
At the same time , Gov. George W. Bush of Texas , who pollsters say is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination , took the opposite tack .
On Friday , the day of the House vote , he signed into law a bill passed by the Texas Legislature that would bar local governments from suing gun manufacturers to recover damages from gun violence , putting him on the side of the National Rifle Association .
Texas is the 14th state to enact such a law .
In a statement from Austin , his office said : `` Governor Bush does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product should be held responsible for the criminal misuse of that product . ''
This dovetails with a pervasive Republican view that cultural factors , such as moral decay and a loss of faith -- not the availability of firearms -- are responsible for disasters like the school shooting in Littleton , Colo .
As Rep. Tom DeLay , the Texas Republican who is the majority whip , put it , the issue is `` God , not guns . ''
Playing off that theme , and providing a counterpoint to the contentious gun legislation , the House did pass , easily , legislation urging states to allow the Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools .
This had the apparently unintended consequence of embodying the Republican response to Littleton in one person , Charlton Heston , the actor who played Moses in the 1956 movie of `` The Ten Commandments '' and who is now the most visible spokesman for the National Rifle Association .
The actions by the House , and the mixed signals from Democrats , many of whom come from conservative gun-supporting districts , may only have confused the public while catapulting the issue into the hands of presidential candidates .
`` Gun control is moving increasingly from the legislative venue to the electoral venue , '' said Marshall Wittmann , an analyst at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative research group based in Washington .
`` It will increasingly be fought out at the presidential level , because essentially these House members voted their districts . ''
Democrats tried to play down the discord in their own party .
`` Obviously it was n't the cleanest of political hits , '' Jim Jordan , a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee , said of the House votes .
Still , Jordan said , `` what matters less is specific votes than overall impressions that political events create . ''
He added : `` It 's not just that Republicans shut down the government or just that they impeached the president against the wishes of the public ; it 's not just that they criticized a legitimate war effort in Kosovo , and it 's not just this gun vote .
It 's a series of events over and over that solidifies an image of being bitter and partisan and nasty and out of touch . ''
Republicans in shaky re-election positions tried to distance themselves from this interpretation .
Rep. James Rogan , R - Calif. , for example , who is already in trouble in his district for pushing the impeachment of President Clinton , bucked his party here and voted the stronger gun-control positions .
Afterward , he lamented that `` extremists on both sides of this important issue '' had blocked the bill .
Other House Republicans reacted angrily to the president 's radio address , saying he had politicized the atmosphere after the Littleton shootings and was trying to shift the blame for the bill 's failure away from Democrats .
Rep. J.C. Watts , R - Okla. , chairman of the House Republican Conference , said that the president had doomed the bill by demanding all or nothing .
Democrats , Watts said , `` walked away from a strong bill that required trigger locks , a ban on the importation of high-capacity magazines , prevented juveniles from possessing semiautomatic guns and prohibited violent juvenile criminals from buying guns as adults . ''
The message that Republicans hope will prevail is the one put forth by Speaker Dennis Hastert , R - Ill. , after the votes .
`` The vast majority of the Democrat caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk forward for the good of the country , '' he said .
For now , it was the combined actions of Bush in Texas and the Congress in Washington that provided Democrats with instant grist for the campaign mill .
Since Gore officially declared his candidacy on Wednesday , he has been warning his audiences that Bush would sign a bill that would `` protect gun manufacturers '' and that he himself would not .
Bush 's spokeswoman , Karen Hughes , countered by suggesting that Gore appeared to be promoting litigation as a solution .
`` If Vice President Gore wants to take the side of frivolous lawsuits , which cost jobs and clog the courts and delay justice for people who need it , we 'll fight that fight , '' she said .
Bradley has until now preferred to speak in broad thematic generalities about his candidacy .
But on Friday night he advocated several specific gun-control measures that he wants to enact , at the same time assuming a lofty tone that suggested both parties in Congress were tied in partisan knots .
`` We end up with a shrill and stale debate that offers false choices and little hope of reducing the carnage in America , '' he said at a dinner in San Francisco .
Bradley said he supported limiting gun purchases to one a month per person , requiring those who own handguns to pass a basic safety course , banning pistols known as Saturday night specials , increasing the license fees for gun dealers and requiring dealers to have photographs and fingerprints taken when they make applications to sell guns .
He said he also wanted to restrict federal firearm licenses to businesses situated in commercial zones , banning them from residential areas .
He said that guns alone among consumer products had generally escaped regulation .
Bradley 's remarks were softer than his campaign 's earlier suggestions that he believed handguns should be banned altogether , and he couched his call for restrictions in language that was sympathetic to gun owners , noting that as a boy he had gone target-shooting with his grandfather .
He also took a subtle dig at Clinton for not doing more .
He said that much of the national conversation about guns was based on polls and focus groups .
`` Why should our leaders self-censor their proposals on gun violence to what they think Congress might be willing to pass , as opposed to what might work ? '' he asked .
Clinton said this month that he had tempered his anti-gun proposals out of a realistic sense of what would pass the Congress .
`` Let 's join the real world here , '' Clinton said when ABC 's Charles Gibson had asked him on `` Good Morning America '' why he had proposed such relatively modest measures .
Clinton said , for example , that he wanted to require people to register their guns just as they are required to register cars , but that he knew Congress would not accept this .
He concluded his radio address Saturday by appealing to the gun lobby to help Congress pass measures to increase the time for background checks on gun buyers and close loopholes on buying guns at gun shows .
`` Nobody is going to be hurt by this legislation , '' he said of proposals to close gun-show loopholes .
He added : `` The American people understand that common-sense gun laws do n't infringe our rights ; they protect our lives .
It 's that simple . ''
