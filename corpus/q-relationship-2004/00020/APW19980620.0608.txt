Taketa and two other members of Gensuikin -LRB- Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs -RRB- earlier visited Pokaran , where India detonated five underground nuclear devices last month .
Gensuikin works with bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki , known as Hibakusha .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">During his visit , Taketa urged both India and Pakistan not to test any more nuclear devices and urged all atomic powers to get rid of their nuclear arsenal .
Fears of an escalation of a nuclear arms race were raised when India and Pakistan recently detonated nuclear weapons .
Taketa fought to control tears as he recalled the devastation wrought by the 1945 atomic bomb and the nightmares that have haunted him since he was 13 years old .</ENAMEX>
Although Taketa believes that the United States has the primary responsibility of destroying its nuclear arsenal , he said `` the people of India and Pakistan must realize how terrifying nuclear weapons really are .
It will be difficult to make governments accept this , but we cannot just sit around .
Time is too short . ''
