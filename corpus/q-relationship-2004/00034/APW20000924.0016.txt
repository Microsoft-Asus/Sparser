SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">North Korean officials arrived in Seoul on Sunday to discuss ways of boosting badly needed South Korean investment in their impoverished , communist country , in the latest in a series of signs of improving relations on the divided peninsula .</ENAMEX>
The North 's delegation , led by senior trade official Jong Un Up , will meet for two days starting Monday in the South Korean capital with a team from the South headed by Assistant Finance and Economy Minister Lee Keun -kyong .
The two sides will discuss agreements to avoid double taxation for South Korean companies operating in the communist North and mechanisms to protect their investments .
They will also discuss establishing direct bank transactions between the two Koreas and a mechanism for settling future business disputes , said a news release from Seoul 's Finance and Economy Ministry .
Such agreements are needed to encourage businesses in the South to invest in North Korea , which is ruled by a Stalinist regime often described as unpredictable by Western officials , Seoul officials said .
Jong 's 15-member North Korean delegation , which included journalists , arrived in Seoul through China .
South Korean President Kim Dae -jung has said his government will help bring more outside investment to North Korea to help rebuild its economy once Pyongyang agrees to ease tensions on the peninsula .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But except for a $ 942 million tourism project run by South Korea 's Hyundai conglomerate , the South 's investments in the North have largely been limited to small-scale joint ventures repairing cars and producing garments , shoes and bottled water .</ENAMEX>
Meanwhile , Kim Il Chul , minister of the North 's People 's Army , was expected to travel to Seoul across the heavily guarded border and fly to the southern resort island of Cheju later Sunday to start the first-ever defense ministers ' talk with the South on Monday .
The two Koreas agreed to work together for reconciliation during their historic summit in June .
They have since stopped propaganda broadcasts , opened government dialogue and began rebuilding a cross-border train line .
In August , 100 people from each side crossed the border for four days of temporary reunions with families they had not seen for five decades following the 1950-53 Korean War .
On Saturday , Red Cross officials from South and North Korea agreed to hold two more such reunions on Nov. 2-4 and Dec. 5-7 respectively .
Each reunion will involve 100 people from each side .
They also agreed to allow 300 people from each side to start exchanging letters with their long-lost kin in November .
The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and pro- Western South Korea at the end of World War II in 1945 .
Their war ended without a peace treaty and their border remains the world 's most heavily fortified .
