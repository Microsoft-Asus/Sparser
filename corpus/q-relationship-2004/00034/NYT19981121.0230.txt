1998 Houston Chronicle SEOUL , South Korea -- Embracing South Korea 's policy of diplomatic engagement , President Clinton encouraged North Korea Saturday to stop its provocative actions and seize the `` historic opportunity '' offered by Seoul for closer ties .
Clinton , emerging from a private session with South Korean President Kim Dae -jung , reaffirmed the United States ' commitment to South Korea 's security and again called on North Korea to allow inspections at a suspected nuclear-related construction site .
North Korea , run by a secretive , insular regime , recently refused to allow Americans to inspect a site believed related to the development of nuclear weapons capacity , one in a series of provocative actions .
North Korea three months ago launched an unarmed missile over Japan 's territory , and the Washington Post reported last week that Pyongyang is building two more rocket facilities .
It also has sent a series of spy submarines into South Korean waters , including one discovered last week .
`` America stands by its unshakable alliance with the Republic of Korea , '' Clinton said , adding that he and President Kim agreed on an approach calling for a `` clear-eyed mix '' of diplomacy and deterrence .
Clinton said that North Korea 's recent actions are `` cause for concern '' and that Pyongyang `` must satisfy our concerns '' about the underground site .
Clinton has assigned former Defense Secretary William Perry to review the U.S. policy on North Korea .
Kim said he and Clinton `` made it clear that we will not tolerate any attempt by North Korea to proliferate nuclear weapons , missiles and other weapons of mass destruction , and decided to closely coordinate in talking with the North on a wide range of pending issues . ''
Clinton embraced Kim 's policy of engagement as South Korean news reports indicated that Kim 's coalition government wanted to avoid raising tensions with North Korea .
Kim recently lifted some restrictions that prevented South Korean businesses from investing in projects in North Korea .
During the news conference , Clinton spoke about a cruise ship filled with South Korean tourists who were being allowed into North Korea for the first time .
`` They -LRB- North Korea -RRB- have a great opportunity here , an historic opportunity with the leadership of President Kim and the position that he has taken , '' Clinton said .
Referring to the controversial construction site , he added : `` Never , nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground , given our defense partnership here , nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage , as much power , as much wealth , as much happiness as more of those ships going up there full of people from here . ''
Clinton praised Kim for his consistent efforts , a first for a South Korean leader , to reach out to the North .
Both Clinton and Kim noted that the `` sunshine policy '' adopted by Kim has netted results such as the resumption of four-party talks that would bring a final settlement to the Korean War .
Although fighting stopped in 1953 , a peace treaty has never been signed .
The United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea where they stand watch over the border between the north and south .
North Korea , led by Kim Jong -il , has become increasingly belligerent as its agrarian economy has failed , and millions of people have suffered famine conditions for several years .
A crisis over the development of nuclear weapons was averted in 1994 when North Korea agreed to stop converting spent nuclear fuel rods into weapons-grade material .
In return , Washington agreed to provide fuel oil while Japan and South Korea agreed to provide replacement reactors .
But Pyongyang shocked its Asian neighbors in August when it fired a missile over Japan .
North Korea last week refused to allow U.S. envoy Charles Kartman to visit the controversial construction site .
North Korea demanded $ 300 million from the United States if it wanted to tour the site as payment for the `` insult . ''
Kartman said the United States had compelling evidence that the facility was nuclear-related but later backtracked from that statement .
Clinton said the United States has `` strong information that raises a suspicion , but no one yet knows for sure , at least in our camp what the facility is and what its intended purpose is .
But it raises a strong suspicion .
We need access to it . ''
South Korea was Clinton 's second stop on his five-day tour of Asia where the once thriving economies have fallen into deep recession .
Clinton visited Kim Dae -jung at the Blue House , the South Korean president 's pagoda-style office and residence .
In South Korea , Kim has been praised by many outside the government for enacting painful but needed reforms that could have endangered his government .
Kim , a former dissident jailed by previous South Korean regimes , has spent much of his first year in office trying to rebuild a collapsed economy .
Clinton will visit U.S. troops today .
On Monday , the president will travel to Guam and then return to Washington .
