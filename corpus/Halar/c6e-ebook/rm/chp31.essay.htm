									<a name="para87"></a><p class="BlockText">The fungal-algal symbiosis producing lichens is thought to have evolved several times independently in different fungal groups. However, lichens fall into three well-defined growth forms. What research could you perform to distinguish these two hypotheses: Hypothesis #1--Crustose, foliose, and fruiticose lichens each represent a monophyletic group; Hypothesis #2--Each lichen growth form represents convergent evolution by taxonomically diverse fungi.</p>

Explain how you could collect data for a particular lichen species at an old cemetery and use the data to calculate the growth rate of that species.</p>

									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">American chestnut trees once made up more than 25%  of the hardwood forests of the eastern United States. These trees were wiped out by a fungus accidentally introduced on imported Asian chestnuts, which are not affected. More recently, a fungus has killed large numbers of dogwood trees from New York to Georgia; some experts suspect the parasite was accidentally introduced from elsewhere. Why are plants particularly vulnerable to fungi imported from other regions? What kinds of human activities might contribute to the spread of plant diseases? Do you think the introduction of plant pathogens like chestnut blight is more likely to occur in the future, or less likely to occur? Why?</p>
