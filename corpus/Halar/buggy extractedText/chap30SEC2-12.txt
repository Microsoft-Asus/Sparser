 The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era

Earth's landscapes changed dramatically with the origin and radiation of flowering plants. The ancestry of angiosperms is still uncertain, but, as discussed earlier, cladistic analysis of gene-sequence data points to Amborella and water lilies such as Nymphaea as the closest living relatives of early angio sperms (see FIGURE 30.11). The oldest fossils that are widely accepted as angiosperms are found in rocks of the early Cretaceous period that are about 130 million years old. In such rock strata, angiosperms are sparsely represented among a much greater abundance of ferns and gymnosperms. By the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, following a period of environmental disturbance, the angiosperms had radiated and become the dominant plants on Earth, as they are today. The change in fossils during the late Cretaceous is so extreme that geologists use the end of that period as the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.
