FREETOWN , Sierra Leone
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A senior Nigerian commander in charge of a West African coalition force in Sierra Leone arrived Wednesday on a fact-finding mission .
Gen. Timothy Shelpidi , who was lauded and given a hero 's welcome to Sierra Leone when his Nigerian -led force drove a brutal military junta from power in Sierra Leone in February , is back to assess ongoing hostilities in the countryside .
Although the coalition force , known as ECOMOG , controls the capital and the vast majority of this small West African country , rebel elements and the remnants of the junta continue to terrorize some communities in eastern Sierra Leone near the borders with Liberia and Guinea , as well as other isolated pockets across the country .
At least 750 people trying to find shelter in the town of Massingbi have perished from hunger and disease over the past few months , a United Nations aid official said Tuesday .
Thousands more in Massingbi , in Sierra Leone 's diamond-rich Kono district , are in danger from measles , malnutrition and diarrhea , the official said .
Fighting between ECOMOG forces , former junta soldiers and their rebel allies was hampering the ability of aid groups to reach the town .
ECOMOG in February swept into the capital Freetown and within days was in full control of the capital and marching into the countryside .
Their advance , although largely successful , has been marked by devastating destruction left behind by fleeing rebel forces .
Rebel forces have been accused of grotesque atrocities , including mass amputations , rape , torture and murder .
Massingbi , about 200 kilometers -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- east of Freetown , has swelled with inhabitants as residents have fled fighting in towns throughout the Kono region .
Intervention force officials , who are now fighting on behalf of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah say the rebels are weakened but still able to fight .
Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup in May 1997 , but restored to power 10 months later by the ECOMOG army .
Other parts of the country have returned to normal , allowing for some of the thousands of Sierra Leonean refuges to return home , the United Nations refugee agency said Wednesday .
A chartered ship carrying 92 refugees home left The Gambia en route for Freetown , the UNHCR said in a statement .
