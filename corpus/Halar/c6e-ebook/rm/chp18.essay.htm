									<a name="para118"></a><p class="BlockText">The success of viruses like HIV lies in their ability to evolve within the host’s body. The HIV virus evades attack by the body’s immune system by mutating at a rapid rate, producing generation after generation of progeny viruses that change before the body can mount a concerted attack, until eventually the viruses overcome the body’s defenses. Thus, the viruses present at a late stage of infection are different from those that initially infected the body, though descended from them. Discuss this as an example of evolution in microcosm. Which viral lineages tend to survive?</p>

									<a name="para120"></a><p class="BlockText">When bacteria infect an animal, the number of bacteria in the body increases gradually. A graph of the growth of the bacterial population is a smoothly increasing curve, as shown in graph (a). A viral infection shows a different pattern. For a while, there is no evidence of infection, and then there is a sudden rise in the number of viruses. The number stays constant for a time; then there is another sudden increase. The curve of viral population growth looks like a series of steps, as shown in graph (b). Explain the difference in the growth curves.<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../img/ufg/UFIG18-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" name="myUFIG18-1.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1"></td></tr></table></p>
