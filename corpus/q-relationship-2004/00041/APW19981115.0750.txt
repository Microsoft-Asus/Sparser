-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Gerardo Bedoya wrote in his Cali , Colombia , daily that he would rather be `` pro- Yankee '' than a friend of drug traffickers .
Jairo Elias Marquez irreverently attacked local lawmakers in his small-town weekly west of Bogota .
Both were killed for their words .
An investigator for the Inter American Press Association reported Sunday that muckraking journalism can be just as dangerous in the smaller towns and cities of South America as in their larger counterparts .
Perhaps more so .
`` Both in Brazil and Colombia , reporters working for major dailies have more working space and are safer , but journalists working in the provinces are more at risk , '' researcher Ana Arana .
told the IAPA 's 54th general assembly here .
Arana told the western hemisphere 's leading publishing group of the risks of groundbreaking journalism against corruption and drug cartels in many South American provinces .
In Colombia , for instance , reporters and columnists in Bogota and other big cities contracted bodyguards and armored cars in 1997 .
Many reporters in small towns did not .
Bedoya , 56 , was shot dead in Cali on March 21 , 1997 ; and Marquez , 42 , on Nov. 20 , 1997 , in Armenia , a small town 190 miles -LRB- 300 kilometers -RRB- west of Bogota .
`` They did not understand that living in the provinces made them more vulnerable , '' Arana said .
Bedoya , a tough editorial writer and columnist for the daily El Pais in Cali , was apparently killed on orders of the Cali cartel , Arana said .
The investigation is in preliminary stages .
After Marquez ' shooting in Armenia , a local congressman who had been attacked by Marquez 's writings was detained for questioning in several killings , according to Arana .
Brazil carries its own dangers for reporters .
`` Brazil is a rambunctious country .
On one side it has major metropolises -- sophisticated and monumental -- but just hours away by cars lies another reality : towns where local powers are locked in feudal times , '' Arana said .
Arustey Guida , 38 , was killed in the town of Sao Fidelis on May 12 , 1995 after fearlessly amassing evidence that local officials ran a car theft ring , according to Arana .
Zaqueu de Oliveira , 28 , published Gazeta de Barroso a local newspaper in Barroso that intended to keep politicians in check .
Under the newspaper slogan `` The Truth to Whomever it Hurts , '' he attacked the local mayor while denouncing bad roads , health problems and other ills unattended by government .
On the morning of March 21 , 1995 he was shot in Barroso 's square .
Though the area was filled with witnesses , no one publicly stepped forward .
These reporters `` were passionately involved in their work and careless in their footsteps , '' Arana said .
