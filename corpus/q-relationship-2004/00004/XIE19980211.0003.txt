ANKARA , February 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- , one of the major northern Iraqi warring parties , denied on Tuesday that Turkish troops crossed the border to establish a security zone in northern Iraq .
A press release faxed to Xinhua by the KDP Ankara Office said that Turkish media reports regarding the so-called Turkish incursion are `` baseless and inaccurate . ''
`` We have not seen any Turkish military movement or any unusual troop buildup inside northern Iraq .
We are also not aware of any intentions by the Turkish government to establish a security zone inside Iraq , '' it said .
The press release said that the Iraqi side of the Turkish - Iraqi border is now under the control of the KDP troops and the Khabour border crossing point remains open for normal traffic .
Local reports said that several thousand Turkish government troops have entered northern Iraq in an effort to establish a buffer zone there .
The KDP , which maintains a closer relationship with Ankara , has been engaging the pro- Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- in fighting since the Iraqi government lost the effective control of northern Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">They said that the buffer zone is mainly designed to prevent the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- from launching hit-and-run attacks on southeastern Turkey</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The PKK has been fighting a 14-year -old war against the Turkish government for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey</ENAMEX> .
At a news briefing Monday , Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan admitted that Turkey has prepared a contingency scheme for a possible flood of Iraqi Kurds into Turkey in case the United States resorts to force to settle its standoff with Iraq .
Nevertheless , he stressed that this does not mean that Turkey will establish a buffer zone in northern Iraq .
`` We certainly do n't call it a buffer zone .
If something happens , the operation will be more humanitarian and civilian than a military one , '' Utkan said .
He added that this operation is aimed at providing food , medicine , shelter and other daily necessities to the Iraqi Kurdish refugees if Iraq is hit by the U.S. forces .
