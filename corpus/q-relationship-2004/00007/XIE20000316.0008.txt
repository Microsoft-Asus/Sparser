MAPUTO , March 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi Wednesday presented the government 's program for the five-year period 2000- 2004 to the parliament .
The program , whose major target is to reduce the country 's levels of absolute poverty by at least 30 percent , also aims to achieve continued rapid economic growth based on the successes of the previous five years , Mocumbi said .
But he admitted that the government 's plans had suffered `` a powerful blow '' in February , with the floods and cyclone hitting the southern and central parts of the country .
At least 492 people had lost their lives in the disaster , said Mocumbi , while two million people were affected , one million of whom were in need of emergency relief .
`` We cannot count on the social contribution of these citizens , '' he said .
`` On the contrary , we have to support them so that they can recover their capacity to participate in the economy . ''
That meant that the state budget and the Economic and Social Plan for 2000 to be presented must be written to take account of the floods .
`` Efforts will be made to ensure humanitarian aid , to resettle flood victims , to normalize their lives and to rebuild economic infrastructures , so as to return to the situation prevailing in late 1999 , '' the prime minister said .
According to Mocumbi , economic development should be aimed at `` eradicating poverty , reducing imbalances between the country 's regions , and strengthening the national business sector . ''
The government would act so as to create `` an economic environment favorable to the development of a strong business sector , able to act effectively and efficiently in the context of the globalization and regionalization of the world economy , '' he said .
This favorable environment involves `` removal of red tape and simplifying procedures , the establishment of a just and balanced fiscal system , the maintenance of a good macro-economic climate , the search for funding for productive activities , and the safeguarding of the free functioning of the financial market , '' he added .
He said in the agro-industrial sector , the government proposes `` to guarantee the food security of the population , and to supply raw material to national industry , thus contributing to import substitution , to improving the country 's balance of trade and to expanding the national supply of manufactured goods . ''
According to Mocumbi , sustainable development should `` rest on the basic resources of the country . ''
The country 's ecosystems should be protected , and environmental education promoted , he said .
Turning to the military and to foreign affairs , Mocumbi said the government gave `` priority to the peaceful resolution of conflicts '' , but thought it necessary to maintain `` the persuasive capacity of the country 's armed forces . ''
