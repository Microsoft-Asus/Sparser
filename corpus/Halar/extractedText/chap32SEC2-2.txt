 The animal kingdom probably evolved from a colonial, flagellated protist

Most systematists now agree that the animal kingdom is monophyletic; that is, if we could trace all animal lineages back to their origin, they would converge on a common ancestor. That ancestor was most likely a colonial flagellated protist that lived over 700 million years ago in the Precambrian era. This protist was probably related to choanoflagellates, a group that arose about a billion years ago. Modern choanoflagellates are tiny, stalked organisms inhabiting shallow ponds, lakes, and marine environments (FIGURE 32.2). FIGURE 32.3 diagrams one hypothesis for how such an ancestor may have evolved into simple animals with specialized cells arranged in two or more layers.
