Far more important are the benefits we derive from these interesting eukaryotes. We depend on them as decomposers and recyclers of organic matter.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Fungi also have a number of practical uses for humans. Most of us have eaten mushrooms, although we may not have realized that we were ingesting the fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) of subterranean fungi. And mushrooms are not the only fungi we eat. The distinctive flavors of certain kinds of cheeses, including Roquefort and blue cheese, come from the fungi used to ripen them. The soft drink industry uses a species of the ascomycete mold <span class="Emphasis1">Aspergillus</span> to produce citric acid for colas. Highly prized by gourmets are truffles, the fruiting bodies of certain mycorrhizal ascomycetes associated with tree roots (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.9b</span>). Their complex flavor is variously described as nutty, musky, cheesy, or all three. The fruiting bodies (ascocarps) release strong odors that attract mammal and insect consumers that excavate the truffles and disperse their spores. In some cases, the odors mimic sex attractants of certain mammals. Truffle hunters traditionally used pigs to locate their prizes, although dogs are now more commonly used.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">More important in food production are unicellular fungi, the yeasts. As discussed on page 627, yeasts are used in baking, brewing, and winemaking. Fungi are medically valuable as well. Some fungi produce antibiotics used to treat bacterial diseases. In fact, the first antibiotic discovered was penicillin, made by the common mold <span class="Emphasis1">Penicillium</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.21</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig31-21','../fig/big/fig31-21.jpg','fig31-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig31-21.jpg" alt="fig31-21" name="myfig31-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 31-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Fungal production of an antibiotic.</span> In this petri dish, the clear area between the mold and the bacterial colony is where the antibiotic produced by <span class="Emphasis1">Penicillium</span> inhibits the growth of the bacteria, a species of <span class="Emphasis1">Staphylococcus</span>.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
