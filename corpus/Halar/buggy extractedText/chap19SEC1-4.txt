THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER

 

 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect the cell cycle



 

 Oncogene proteins and faulty tumor-suppressor proteins interfere with normal signaling pathways



 

 Multiple mutations underlie the development of cancer



In Chapter 12, we considered cancer as a set of diseases in which cells escape from the control mechanisms normally limiting their growth. Now that we have discussed the molecular basis of gene expression and its regulation, we are ready to look at cancer more closely.
