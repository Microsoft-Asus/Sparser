Do we think of them as nature’s most complex molecules or as the simplest forms of life? Either way, we must bend our usual definitions. An isolated virus is biologically inert, unable to replicate its genes or regenerate its own supply of ATP. Yet it has a genetic program written in the universal language of life. Although viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that cannot reproduce independently, it is hard to deny their evolutionary connection to the living world.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">How did viruses originate? Because they depend on cells for their own propagation, it is reasonable to assume that viruses are not the descendants of precellular prototypes of life, but evolved <span class="Emphasis1">after</span> the first cells appeared. Most molecular biologists favor the hypothesis that viruses originated from fragments of cellular nucleic acids that could move from one cell to another. Consistent with this idea is the observation that a viral genome usually has more in common with the genome of its host than with the genomes of viruses infecting other hosts. Indeed, some viral genes are essentially identical to genes of the host, as in the case of oncogenes, for example. Perhaps the earliest viruses were naked bits of nucleic acid, similar to plant viroids, that made it from one cell to another via injured cell surfaces. The evolution of genes coding for capsid proteins may have facilitated the infection of undamaged cells.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Candidates for the original sources of viral genomes include two kinds of cellular genetic elements, plasmids and transposons. Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that are separate from chromosomes. They are found in bacteria and also in yeasts, which are unicellular eukaryotes. Plasmids, like most viruses, can replicate independently of the rest of the cell’s genome and are occasionally transferred between cells. Transposons are DNA segments that can move from one location to another within a cell’s genome. Thus, plasmids, transposons, and viruses all share an important feature: They are mobile genetic elements. (We will discuss plasmids and transposons in more detail later in the chapter.)</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">It is the evolutionary relationship between viruses and the genomes of their host cells that makes viruses such useful model systems in molecular biology. By studying how the replication of viruses is controlled, researchers are learning more about the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication and gene expression (transcription and translation) in cells. Bacteria are equally valuable as microbial models in genetics research, but for different reasons. Unlike viruses, bacteria are true cells. But as prokaryotic cells, bacteria provide researchers with the opportunity to investigate molecular genetics in the simplest organisms. In fact, <span class="Emphasis1">E. coli,</span> the bacterium sometimes called "the laboratory rat of molecular biology," is the most completely understood of all organisms at the molecular level. Let’s now learn more about the genetics of bacteria.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
