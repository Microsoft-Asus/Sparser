LAGOS , September 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Liberian President Charles Taylor has ordered the security forces and the west African peacekeeping force -LRB- ECOMOG -RRB- to man the border with Sierra Leone so as to avoid possible problems along the side of Liberia .
The order followed the influx of thousands of Sierra Leoneans into the country , particularly after the renewed fighting between Sierra Leone 's militia group Kamajors and government soldiers near the border in the past few days .
Increasing tension in Sierra Leone since a coup that toppled President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah 's legitimate government on May 25 has forced many Sierra Leoneans to flee to neighboring Liberia .
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said today that over 100,000 Sierra Leoneans are coming across the border , quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation .
According to him , decision has been made in the view of the government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to move quickly to the border to relocate the refugees .
He said Liberia has no sympathy for any armed factions in Sierra Leone , adding that the Liberian government is hoping to see the crisis in that country can be resolved peacefully .
`` Whether they -LRB- the Kamajors -RRB- are fighting to restore President Kabbah or not , the mandate of the ECOWAS is that they should all return to the peace table and find amicable solution in Sierra Leone just as it was done in Liberia , '' he said .
According to the minister , President Taylor today told his justice minister and commanders of the security forces that Liberia never could be used as a spring board for recruiting a force for the situation in Sierra Leone .
Sierra Leone is under economic embargo ordered by the Economic Community of West African States -LRB- ECOWAS -RRB- , a move of the sub-regional body to force the junta to step down .
