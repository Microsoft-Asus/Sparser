 The localization of enzymes withina cell helps order metabolism

The cell is not just a bag of chemicals with thousands of different kinds of enzymes and substrates wandering about randomly. Structures within the cell help bring order to metabolic pathways. In some cases, a team of enzymes for several steps of a metabolic pathway is assembled together as a multienzyme complex. The arrangement controls the sequence of reactions, as the product from the first enzyme becomes substrate for the adjacent enzyme in the complex, and so on, until the end product is released. Some enzymes and enzyme complexes have fixed locations within the cell as structural components of particular membranes. Others are in solution within specific membrane-enclosed eukaryotic organelles, each with its own internal chemical environment. For example, in eukaryotic cells the enzymes for cellular respiration reside within mitochondria (FIGURE 6.21). If the cell had the same number of enzyme molecules for respiration but they were diluted throughout the entire volume of the cell, respiration would be very inefficient.

Fig 6-21. Organelles and structural order in metabolism. Membranes partition a eukaryotic cell into various metabolic compartments, or organelles, each with a corps of enzymes that carry out specific functions. The organelles shown in this micrograph are mitochondria, the sites of cellular respiration.

The structural basis of metabolic order brings us back to the theme with which this unit of chapters began.
