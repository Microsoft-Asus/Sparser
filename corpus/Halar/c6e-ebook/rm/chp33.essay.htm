									<a name="para138"></a><p class="BlockText">Horseshoe crabs are called "living fossils" because the fossil record shows they have remained essentially unchanged in morphology for many millions of years. Why might this organism have retained the same morphology for this vast time period? What other aspects of its biology, less obvious than structure, do you think may have evolved?</p>

									<a name="para142"></a><p class="BlockText">Construction of a dam and irrigation canals in an African country has enabled farmers to increase the amount of food they can grow. In the past, crops were planted only after spring floods; the fields were too dry the rest of the year. Now fields can be watered year-round. Improvement in crop yield has had an unexpected cost--a tremendous increase in the incidence of schistosomiasis, or blood fluke disease. Look at the blood fluke life cycle in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.11</span> and imagine that your Peace Corps assignment is to help local health officials control the disease. Why do you think the irrigation project increased the incidence of schistosomiasis? It is difficult and expensive to control the disease with drugs. Suggest three other methods that could be tried to prevent people from becom ing infected.</p>
