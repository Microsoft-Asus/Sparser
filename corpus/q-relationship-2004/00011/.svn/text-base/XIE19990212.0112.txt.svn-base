BEIRUT , February 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Lebanese army intelligence has smashed a spy ring working for Israel in Lebanon , the National Broadcasting Network radio reported Friday .
Some 20 alleged members of the ring , who are suspected of providing information about activities of the Lebanese army and anti- Israeli guerrillas to Israeli secret service , have been arrested and are under interrogation .
The intelligence is searching across the country for other members at large .
The ring was cracked down shortly after a senior intelligence officer of the Israeli -allied South Lebanon Army -LRB- SLA -RRB- defected to the Lebanese army .
He fled Friday with his wife and three-year -old son the village of Shebaa in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon .
Israeli troops and the SLA have since been laying siege to Shabaa , imposing a curfew and conducting daily house raids to find out how the SLA officer escaped .
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas ' cross-border attacks .
Iranian -backed Hezbollah , or Party of God , has been since spearheading a guerrilla war to try to oust Israeli occupation troops and SLA militia out of the country .
