BELFAST , Northern Ireland
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Seizing upon his Nobel Peace Prize as fresh ammunition for his arguments , Protestant leader David Trimble called on the IRA to start disarming as he returned to Northern Ireland Saturday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble 's wife Daphne and youngest daughter Sarah , 6 , braved a media throng at Belfast International Airport to greet Trimble , who on Friday shared this year 's Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume , leader of the north 's major Roman Catholic party </ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble , 54</ENAMEX> , was sleeping in his Denver hotel room at 5 a.m .
Friday -- nearing the end of his weeklong tour to drum up North American investment in Northern Ireland -- when the Norwegian Nobel Committee made its announcement .
He flew overnight from Chicago , arriving more jet-lagged than jubilant .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">It is an honor , an honor which I am deeply conscious of for myself , '' said Trimble , who emphasized that credit should be spread widely among negotiators of his Ulster Unionist Party and Hume 's Social Democratic and Labor Party , whom he said provided `` the center of gravity '' in the 22-month-long talks that achieved historic accord in April</ENAMEX> .
It committed the IRA -allied Sinn Fein party and representatives of the north 's two major pro- British paramilitary groups -- all of which back the accord -- to disarm by mid-2000 .
Trimble cited Nobel recognition for Northern Ireland as an added incentive for the IRA to start disarming now , something the outlawed group refuses to do .
Trimble said Protestant lawmakers wo n't work with Sinn Fein in a new cross-community government until the IRA does so .
Referring both to Sinn Fein and the IRA , Trimble said : `` I hope this award will encourage the republican movement to take the steps that are necessary to give public confidence and assurance that we are going to see the end of the troubles of the last three decades . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Hume has consistently criticized Trimble for making IRA disarmament a condition to Sinn Fein 's full inclusion in the new political structures</ENAMEX> .
When asked Friday in New York whether the Nobel committee 's decision would influence the IRA , Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said : `` I do n't think the IRA got a prize , did they ? ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">While Hume had been considered Northern Ireland 's most likely Nobel winner , Trimble was considered a dark-horse candidate because of his success in committing the north 's main British Protestant party to April 's accord -- and as crucially , delivering a bare majority of Protestant public support in the May referendum .</ENAMEX>
The Nobel prize , Trimble said , `` shows that the international community recognizes that Northern Ireland is coming out of the turmoil that we have had over the last three decades ... that we are in the process of bringing into existence a new Northern Ireland . ''
Meanwhile in Dublin , Hume spent a quiet day with his wife rather than attend ceremonies marking the official opening of the University of Notre Dame 's extension campus in the Irish capital .
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern , who received an honorary doctorate from Notre Dame , told 200 invited dignitaries and students that Hume had `` given 30 years of his life to try and find an accommodation between the two main traditions of the historical divide . ''
`` Many times he failed , but it never stopped him .
Each time he sought new ideas for new initiatives , and to seek to convince others to pursue them , '' Ahern said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Ahern , a potential Nobel candidate for his own high-profile role in the final days of negotiations , also credited Trimble for overcoming `` horrendous opposition '' within his party .
`` David Trimble today is not welcomed in parts of his constituency , he 's been in considerable danger in some parts of his constituency , and that 's not nice for any politician ... but he has faced that down , '' Ahern said</ENAMEX> .
When asked about the prize money of 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 963,000 -RRB- they will share after December 's award ceremony in Stockholm , both Trimble and Hume have said they had no idea what they would do with it .
