On your next walk through a field or woodland, or even across campus or through a park, try to observe some of the interactions among the species present. You may see birds using trees as nesting sites, bees pollinating flowers, shelf fungi growing on trees, caterpillars feeding on leaves, spiders trapping insects in their webs, ferns growing in shade provided by trees--a sample of the many interactions that exist in any ecological theater. In addition to the physical and chemical factors discussed in Chapter 50, an organism's environment includes other individuals of the same species as well as populations of other species living in the same area. Such an assemblage of species living close enough together for potential interaction is called a biological community. In the photograph that opens this chapter, the lion, the zebra, the hyena, the vultures, and the grasses and other plants are all members of a grassland community in East Africa.

This chapter examines the different kinds of interactions among organisms and addresses the central issue in community ecology: What factors are most significant in structuring a community--in determining its species composition and the relative abundance of species present?





WHAT IS A COMMUNITY?

 

 Contrasting views of communities are rooted in the individualistic and interactive hypotheses



 

 The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models



A community is any assemblage of populations in an area or habitat. Ecologists define the boundaries of a particular community to fit their research questions. We might study the community of decomposers and other organisms in a rotting log, the benthic community in Lake Superior, or the community of trees and shrubs in Shenandoah National Park. A community has a set of properties defined by its species composition, with a structure determined by the interactions between the species. Communities differ dramatically in their species richness, the number of species that they contain. But some species are common and some are rare, and so communities also differ in their relative abundance of different species. What causes each community to have a certain assemblage of species? Two very different answers to this question have polarized community ecologists for over 50 years.

 Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics



 

 Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure



 

 The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators



There are different interspecific interactions--relationships between the species of a community. We will start with the simplest situation: an interaction between just two species.





DISTURBANCE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

 

 Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances



 

 Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance



 

 Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance



Decades ago, most ecologists favored the traditional view that biological communities are in a state of equilibrium, a more or less stable balance, unless seriously disturbed by human activities. This "balance of nature" view focused on interspecific competition as a key factor determining community composition and maintaining stability in communities. Stability in this context is the tendency of a community to reach and maintain an equilibrium, or relatively constant composition of species, in the face of disturbances. But in many communities, at least on a local scale, change seems to be more common than stability. This recent emphasis on change has led to a nonequilibrium model of communities, where communities are seen as constantly changing after being buffeted by disturbances. The key question here is the role of disturbances in affecting community structure and composition.





BIOGEOGRAPHIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE BIODIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES

 

 Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance



 

 Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient

 Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland



Ecological communities vary extensively in the number of species they contain. Two key factors correlated with a community's biodiversity, or species diversity, are its size and geographic location. In the 1850s, both Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin pointed out that plant and animal life was generally more abundant and varied in the tropics than in other parts of the globe. Darwin and Wallace also noted that small or remote islands have fewer species than large islands or those nearer continents. Such observations imply that biogeographic patterns in biodiversity conform to a set of basic principles rather than being accidents of evolutionary history. How can we explain these large-scale patterns in the diversity of life? We must first learn how to measure the biodiversity of a community.





 Contrasting views of communities are rooted in the individualistic and interactive hypotheses

How can we account for the species found together as members of a community? Two different views on this question emerged among ecologists in the 1920s and 1930s, based primarily on observations of plant distributions. We will briefly describe these historical arguments because they are the forerunners of the closely related rivet and redundancy models, two community models still debated today.

An individualistic hypothesis of community structure was first enunciated by H. A. Gleason, of the University of Chicago, in the early 1900s. It depicted the plant community as a chance assemblage of species found in the same area simply because they happen to have similar abiotic requirements--for example, for temperature, rainfall, and soil type. An alternative view, the interactive hypothesis, was advocated by F. E. Clements, also in the early 1900s. Clements saw the community as an assemblage of closely linked species, locked into association by mandatory biotic interactions that cause the community to function as an integrated unit--as a superorganism. Evidence for the interactive view was based on the observation that certain species of plants are consistently found together as a group. For example, deciduous forests in the northeastern United States usually include certain species of oak, maple, birch, and beech, along with a specific assemblage of shrubs and vines. These two very different ways of thinking about community structure--individualistic versus interactive--suggest different priorities in studying biological communities. The individualistic hypothesis emphasizes studying single species, while the interactive hypothesis emphasizes entire assemblages of species as the essential units for understanding the interrelationships and distributions of organisms.

These two hypotheses of plant community organization make contrasting predictions about how plant species should be distributed along an environmental gradient, such as a gradual change in moisture or temperature over some distance. The individualistic hypothesis predicts that communities should generally lack discrete geographic boundaries because each species has an independent distribution along the environmental gradient. In other words, each species will be distributed according to its tolerance ranges for abiotic factors that vary along a gradient, and communities should change continuously along the gradient, with the addition or loss of particular species (FIGURE 53.1a). In contrast, the interactive hypothesis predicts that species should be clustered into discrete communities with noticeable boundaries, because the presence or absence of a particular species is largely governed by the presence or absence of other species with which it interacts in its group (FIGURE 53.1b).

Fig 53-1. Testing the individualistic and interactive hypotheses of communities. Ecologist Robert Whittaker tested these two hypotheses by graphing the abundance of different plant species (y axis) along environmental gradients of abiotic factors such as temperature or moisture (x axis). Each colored curve represents the abundance of one species.

In most actual cases, especially where there are broad regions characterized by gradients of environmental variation, the composition of plant communities does seem to change continuously, with each species more or less independently distributed (FIGURE 53.1c). Such distributions generally support the view of plant communities as relatively loose associations without discrete boundaries. However, where some key factor in the physical environment changes abruptly, adjacent communities are delineated by correspondingly sharp boundaries. The most striking examples of sharp boundaries result from changes in soil type. In general, sharp boundaries between plant communities are rare in nature. However, humans have altered the landscape through agriculture and forestry to produce many artificial sharp boundaries, and in Chapter 55, we will explore the consequences of this habitat alteration.





 The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models

The individualistic hypothesis is generally accepted by plant ecologists today, but further debate arises in the application of these ideas to the animals in a community. In 1981, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, of Stanford University, suggested that species in a community are like the rivets in the wings of airplanes: Not all the rivets are required to hold the wing together, but if someone started taking out the rivets one by one, we would become concerned about flying in that airplane. The rivet model of communities is a reincarnation of the interactive model of Clements that was suggested for plant communities. The rivet model suggests that most of the species in a community are associated tightly with other species in a web of life. Thus, reducing or increasing the abundance of one species in a community affects many other species.

In 1992, Brian Walker suggested an opposing view of communities, the redundancy model. According to this model, most of the species in a community are not tightly associated with one another, and the web of life is very loose. An increase or decrease in one species in a community has little effect on other species, which operate independently, just as suggested by Gleason 80 years before in his individualistic model of the plant community. Species within a community are redundant. For example, if one predator disappears, another predatory species in the community will usually take its place as a consumer of specific prey. If one pollinator ceases to visit a particular species of flowering plant because the pollinator has disappeared from the area, another pollinator species will do the job.

No matter which (if either) of these two models is correct, it is important to study species relationships in communities. Species in communities do interact, even if some of these interactions are not imperative for the species. It is also important to remember that these two models represent extremes, although most communities actually lie somewhere in the middle. To answer some key questions, we need to determine how species interact in communities and how tight these associations are. For example, what happens to a community when one species is lost or is replaced with a species introduced by humans? Such questions are important because they underlie many of our environmental problems today.





 Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism

The possible interspecific interactions are introduced in TABLE 53.1. In this simplified view, we use a pair of signs, such as +/-, to symbolize how an interspecific interaction affects the population densities of the two species. For example, mutual symbiosis (mutualism) is a +/+ interaction, meaning that the density of each species is increased in the presence of the other. Predation is an example of a +/- interaction, with a positive effect on the population density of one species (the predator) and a negative effect on the density of the other population (the prey).

Interspecific competition for resources can occur when resources are in short supply. The weeds growing in a garden are competing with garden plants for soil nutrients and water. Grasshoppers and bison compete in the Great Plains for the grass they eat. Lynx and foxes compete for prey such as snowshoe hares in the northern forests of Alaska and Canada. There is a potential for competition between any two species that need the same limited resource. Some resources, such as oxygen, are not usually in short supply, and although many species use this resource, they do not compete for it. If two populations do compete for a resource, the result may be a reduction in the density of one or both species or the local elimination of one of the two competitors.

The Competitive Exclusion Principle. In 1934, Russian ecologist G. F. Gause studied the effects of interspecific competition in laboratory experiments with two closely related species of protists, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum. Gause cultured the protists under stable conditions with a constant amount of food added every day. When he grew the two species in separate cultures, each population grew rapidly and then leveled off at what was apparently the carrying capacity of the culture. But when Gause cultured the two species together, P. aurelia apparently had a competitive edge in obtaining food, and P. caudatum was driven to extinction in the culture. Gause concluded that two species so similar that they compete for the same limiting resources cannot coexist in the same place. One will use the resources more efficiently and thus reproduce more rapidly. Even a slight reproductive advantage will eventually lead to local elimination of the inferior competitor. Ecologists call Gause's concept the competitive exclusion principle.

The Ecological Niche. The sum total of a species' use of the biotic and abiotic resources in its environment is called the species' ecological niche. One way to grasp the concept is through an analogy made by ecologist Eugene Odum: If an organism's habitat is its address, the niche is that habitat plus the organism's occupation. Put another way, an organism's niche is its ecological role--how it "fits into" an ecosystem. The niche of a population of tropical tree lizards, for example, consists of, among many other components, the temperature range it tolerates, the size of branches on which it perches, the time of day in which it is active, and the size and type of insects it eats.

We can now restate the competitive exclusion principle to say that two species cannot coexist in a community if their niches are identical. However, ecologically similar species can coexist in a community if there are one or more significant differences in their niches. Numerous tests of competitive exclusion hypotheses include classic field experiments with two species of barnacles that attach to intertidal rocks on the North Atlantic coast (FIGURE 53.2).

Fig 53-2. Testing a competitive exclusion hypothesis in the field. Balanus balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus are two species of barnacles that grow on rocks exposed during low tide along the Scottish coast. The barnacles have a stratified distribution, with Balanus most concentrated on the lower portions of the rocks and Chthamalus on the higher portions. The swimming larvae of the barnacles may settle randomly on the rocks and begin to develop into sessile adults, but Balanus fails to survive high on the rocks because it is unable to resist desiccation when these areas are exposed to air for several hours during low tides. Its fundamental niche (potential niche) and its realized niche (actual niche) are similar. Even though Chthamalus is concentrated primarily on the upper strata of rocks, when ecologist Joseph Connell removed Balanus from the lower strata, the Chthamalus population spread into that area. Thus, Chthamalus could survive lower on the rocks than where it is generally found, were it not for competition from Balanus. Its realized niche is only a fraction of its fundamental niche.

Resource Partitioning. There are two possible outcomes of competition between species having identical niches: Either the less competitive species will be driven to local extinction, or one of the species may evolve enough through natural selection to use a different set of resources. This differentiation of niches that enables similar species to coexist in a community is called resource partitioning (FIGURE 53.3, p. 1178). We can think of resource partitioning within a community as "the ghost of competition past"--circumstantial evidence of earlier interspecific competition resolved by the evolution of niche differentiation.

Character Displacement. As a complement to studies of resource partitioning, a related line of circumstantial evidence for the importance of competition comes from comparisons of closely related species whose populations are sometimes sympatric and sometimes allopatric. Although allopatric populations of such species are similar in structure and use similar resources, sympatric populations often show differences in body structures and in the resources they use. The tendency for characteristics to be more divergent in sympatric populations of two species than in allopatric populations of the same two species is called character displacement. The Gal&aacute;pagos finches described in Chapter 25 provide a good example of character displacement in beak sizes and, presumably, in the seeds that they can eat most efficiently. Allopatric populations of Geospiza fuliginosa and G. fortis have beaks of similar size, but on an island where both species occur, a significant difference in beak depth has evolved (FIGURE 53.4, p. 1178). This difference presumably enables the two species to avoid competition by feeding on seeds of different sizes and probably represents an evolutionary outcome of past competition.

Fig 53-4. Character displacement: circumstantial evidence for competition in nature. Although allopatric populations of potential competitors are often similar in morphology and use equivalent resources, sympatric populations may diverge in both characteristics. In this example, two species of Gal&eacute;pagos finches have similar beak morphologies and presumably eat similarly sized seeds where their populations are allopatric on Daphne and Los Hermanos islands. However, where the two species are sympatric on Santa Mar&iacute;a and San Crist&oacute;bal, Geospiza fuliginosa has a shallower, smaller beak and G. fortis a deeper, larger one. Such evolutionary changes in body structure are thought to reflect resource partitioning. In this case, the two species have adapted to eating different sizes of seeds.

Predation

The term predation illicits such images as a lion killing and eating an antelope or other prey. But ecologists extend the definition of predation to include herbivory, in which an herbivore such as a bison eats part of a plant, and parasitism, in which a parasite lives on or in its host organism and depends on the host species for nutrition.

It won't surprise you that predation is a potent factor in adaptive evolution. Eating and avoiding being eaten are prerequisite to reproductive success. Natural selection refines the adaptations of both predators and prey.

Predator Adaptations. Many important feeding adaptations of predators are both obvious and familiar. Most predators have acute senses that enable them to locate and identify potential prey. In addition, many predators have adaptations such as claws, teeth, fangs, stingers, or poison that help catch and subdue the organisms on which they feed. Rattlesnakes and other pit vipers, for example, locate their prey with special heat-sensing organs located between each eye and nostril, and they kill small birds and mammals by injecting them with toxins through their fangs. Similarly, many herbivorous insects locate appropriate food plants by the using chemical sensors on their feet, and their mouthparts are adapted for shredding tough vegetation. Predators that pursue their prey are generally fast and agile, whereas those that lie in ambush are often camouflaged in their environments.

Plant Defenses Against Herbivores. Plants cannot run away from herbivores. Chemical toxins, often in combination with antipredator spines and thorns, are a plant's main arsenal against being eaten to extinction. Among such chemical weapons are the poison strychnine, produced by the tropical vine Strychnos toxifera; morphine, from the opium poppy; nicotine, from the tobacco plant; mescaline, from peyote cactus; and tannins, from a variety of plant species. Other defensive compounds that are not toxic to humans but may be distasteful to other herbivores are responsible for the familiar flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and peppermint. Some plants even produce chemicals that imitate insect hormones and cause abnormal development in some insects that eat them.

Animal Defenses Against Predators. Animals can avoid being eaten by using passive defenses, such as hiding, or active defenses, such as escaping or defending themselves against predators. Fleeing is a common antipredator response, though it can be very costly in terms of energy. Many animals flee into a shelter and avoid being caught without expending the energy required for a prolonged flight. Active self-defense is less common, though some large grazing mammals will vigorously defend their young from predators such as lions. Other behavioral defenses include alarm calls, which often bring in many individuals of the prey species that mob the predator. For example, crows will sometimes gang up and peck on barn owls, which prey on crow eggs.

Many other defenses rely on adaptive coloration, which has evolved repeatedly among animals. Camouflage, or cryptic coloration, is a passive defense that makes potential prey difficult to spot against its background (FIGURE 53.5).

Some animals have mechanical or chemical defenses against would-be predators (see the interview with Thomas Eisner on p. 24). Most predators are strongly discouraged by the familiar defenses of skunks and porcupines. Some animals, such as poisonous toads and frogs, can synthesize toxins. Others acquire chemical defense passively by accumulating toxins from the plants they eat. For example, monarch butterflies store poisons from the milkweed plants they eat as larvae, making the butterflies distasteful to some potential predators.

Animals with effective chemical defenses are often brightly colored, a warning to predators known as aposematic coloration (FIGURE 53.6). This warning coloration seems to be adaptive; there is evidence that predators are more cautious in dealing with bright color patterns in potential prey, perhaps because so many aposematic animals tend to be dangerous prey. In an example of convergent evolution, unpalatable animals in several different taxa have similar patterns of coloration--black with yellow or red stripes characterize unpalatable animals as diverse as yellow-jacket wasps and coral snakes.

Fig 53-6. Aposematic (warning) coloration of a poison-arrow frog. The skin of this tree frog, an inhabitant of rain forests in Costa Rica, produces noxious chemicals. Predators apparently learn to associate the vivid markings of the frog with danger as soon as they touch the frog's skin. In some parts of South America, human hunters in the rain forest tip their arrows with poisons from similar frogs to bring down large mammals.

A species of prey may gain significant protection through mimicry, a "copycat" adaptation in which one species mimics the appearance of another. In Batesian mimicry, a palatable or harmless species mimics an unpalatable or harmful model. In one intriguing example, the larva of the hawkmoth puffs up its head and thorax when disturbed, looking like the head of a small poisonous snake, complete with eyes (FIGURE 53.7). The mimicry even involves behavior; the larva weaves its head back and forth and hisses like a snake. In M&uuml;llerian mimicry, two or more unpalatable species resemble each other. Presumably, each species gains an additional advantage because the pooling of numbers causes predators to learn more quickly to avoid any prey with a particular appearance (FIGURE 53.8).

Fig 53-8. M&uuml;llerian mimicry. Both (a) the cuckoo bee and (b) the yellow jacket wasp have stingers that release toxins. The cross-mimicry in appearance presumably benefits both species because predators learn more quickly to avoid any prey with these distinctive markings.

Predators also use mimicry in a variety of ways. For example, some snapping turtles have tongues that resemble a wriggling worm, thus luring small fish; any fish that tries to eat the "bait" is itself quickly consumed as the turtle's strong jaws snap closed.

Parasites and Pathogens as Predators. Parasitism is a symbiotic interaction in which one organism, the parasite, derives its nourishment from another organism, its host, which is harmed in the process. (Note that this text adopts the most general definition of symbiosis as including parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism, which are all discussed in this chapter. However, some biologists prefer to use the term symbiosis more specifically as a synonym for mutualism.)

Parasites that live within their host, such as tapeworms and malarial parasites, are called endoparasites; parasites that feed on the external surface of a host, such as mosquitoes and aphids, are called ectoparasites. In a special type of parasitism called parasitoidism, insects--usually small wasps--lay eggs on living hosts. The larvae then feed on the body of the host, eventually killing it.

In terms of their effects, pathogens, or disease-causing organisms, are similar to parasites. Pathogens are typically bacteria, viruses, or protists, but fungi and prions (protein bodies; see Chapter 18) may also be pathogenic. In contrast to pathogens, which are generally microscopic, many parasites are relatively large, multicellular organisms, such as tapeworms. Also, most parasites inflict nonlethal damage on their hosts--by pilfering nutrients, for example--while many pathogens can inflict lethal harm.

Mutualism

Mutual symbiosis, or mutualism, is an interspecific interaction that benefits both species. Mutualistic relationships sometimes require the coevolution of adaptations in both participating species. Changes in either species are likely to affect the survival and reproduction of the other. We have described many examples of mutualism in previous chapters: nitrogen fixation by bacteria in the root nodules of legumes; the digestion of cellulose by microorganisms in the digestive systems of termites and ruminant mammals; photosynthesis by unicellular algae in the tissues of corals: and the exchange of nutrients in mycorrhizae, the association of fungi and the roots of plants. FIGURE 53.9 illustrates another example, a mutualism between ants and acacia trees in Central and South America.

Fig 53-9. Mutualism between acacia trees and ants. Certain species of Central and South American acacia trees have hollow thorns that house stinging ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex. The ants feed on sugar produced by nectaries on the tree and on protein-rich swellings called Beltian bodies (orange in the photograph) that grow at the tips of leaflets. The acacia benefits from housing and feeding a population of pugnacious ants, which attack anything that touches the tree. The ants sting other insects, remove fungal spores and other debris, and clip surrounding vegetation that happens to grow close to the foliage of the acacia.

Many mutualistic relationships may have evolved from predator-prey or host-parasite interactions. Most angiosperm plants, for example, have adaptations that attract animals that function in pollination or seed dispersal. Any plants that could derive some benefit by sacrificing such organic materials as nectar rather than pollen or seeds would increase their reproductive success.

Commensalism

Commensalism is an interaction between species that benefits only one of the species involved in the interaction. "Hitchhiking" species, such as algae that grow on the shells of aquatic turtles or barnacles that attach to whales, are sometimes considered commensal. However, the hitchhikers may actually decrease the reproductive success of their hosts slightly by reducing the efficiency of movement in the hosts' search for food or escape from predators.

Commensal associations sometimes involve one species obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by another. For instance, cowbirds and cattle egrets (also birds) feed on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing bison, cattle, horses, and other herbivores. Because the birds increase their feeding rates when following the herbivores, they clearly benefit from the association. Much of the time, the herbivores may be unaffected by the relationship. However, there are times when they, too, derive some benefit; the birds tend to be opportunistic feeders that occasionally remove and eat ticks and other ectoparasites from the herbivores.

Coevolution and Interspecific Interactions

In describing the adaptations of certain organisms to the presence of other organisms in a community, the term coevolution comes up often--perhaps too often. There is actually little evidence for coevolution in most cases of interspecific interactions.

Coevolution refers to reciprocal evolutionary adaptations of two interacting species. A change in one species acts as a selective force on another species, in which counteradaptation in turn acts as a selective force on the first species. This linkage of adaptations requires reciprocal genetic change in the interacting populations of the two species. An example of such dual adaptation that probably qualifies as coevolution is the gene-for-gene recognition between a plant species and a species of avirulent pathogen (see FIGURE 39.31). In contrast, the warning coloration of various tree frogs and the aversion reactions of various predators do not qualify as coevolution because these are adaptations to a category of other organisms in the community rather than coupled adaptation between just two species.

Despite the current view that coevolution is difficult to demonstrate for most interspecific interactions in communities, biologists agree more generalized adaptation of organisms to other organisms in their environment--to biotic factors--is a fundamental feature of life. Which of the biological interactions we have surveyed is most important in structuring communities? At the present time, most ecologists think that predation and competition are the key processes driving community dynamics. But this conclusion is based mainly on research in temperate communities. Ecologists have far fewer data for interspecific interactions in tropical communities.





 Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics

The dynamics and structure of a community depend to a large extent on the feeding relationships between organisms--the trophic structure of the community. The transfer of food energy from its source in plants and other photosynthetic organisms (primary producers) through herbivores (primary consumers) to carnivores (secondary and tertiary consumers) and eventually to decomposers is referred to as a food chain. In the 1920s, Oxford biologist Charles Elton first pointed out that the length of a food chain is usually limited to four or five links, or trophic levels (FIGURE 53.10). Elton also recognized that food chains are not isolated units but are hooked together into food webs.

Food Webs

Who eats whom in a community? An ecologist can summarize the trophic relationships of a community by diagramming a food web with arrows linking species according to their trophic relationship. For example, FIGURE 53.11 is a simplified food web for an Antarctic pelagic community found in the seasonally productive Southern Ocean. The dominant herbivores in the Antarctic are euphausids (krill, which are crustaceans) and herbivorous plankton such as copepods. These zooplankton species are in turn eaten by various carnivores, including penguins, seals, fish, and baleen whales. Squid, which are carnivores that feed on fish as well as zooplankton, are another important link in these food chains, as they are in turn eaten by seals and toothed whales. During the whaling years, humans became the top predator of this food chain. Having reduced the whales to low numbers, humans are now harvesting at lower trophic levels, including the fishing for krill.

Fig 53-11. An antarctic marine food web. Arrows follow the transfer of food from the producers (phytoplankton) through the trophic levels. As in FIGURE 53.10, this diagram omits decomposers, which "feed" at all trophic levels. Blue arrows indicate the major trophic interactions.

What transforms food chains into food webs? First, a given species may weave into the web at more than one trophic level. For example, male horseflies feed as primary consumers on nectar and plant juices, whereas the females are bloodsucking ectoparasites that feed as secondary or even tertiary consumers. Second, most consumers are nonexclusive. For example, foxes are omnivores with diets that include berries and other plant materials, herbivores such as mice, and other predators, such as weasels. Humans are among the most versatile of omnivores.

Food webs can be very complicated, but we can simplify them in two ways. First, we can group species into fairly broad taxonomic groups if their trophic relationships in a community are similar. For example, in FIGURE 53.11, over 100 phytoplankton species are combined in one "functional group," that of primary consumers in the food web. A second way to simplify a food web is to isolate a part of the web that interacts very little with the rest of the community. FIGURE 53.12 illustrates a partial food web for sea nettles (jellies) and juvenile striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. This partial food web can be "pulled out" from a more complex web because these species interact very little with the rest of the community in terms of feeding relationships. Note that sea nettles are secondary consumers of zooplankton and tertiary consumers of fish larvae, which themselves are secondary consumers of zooplankton.

Animals at successive trophic levels in a food chain tend to be larger with each link (except for parasites). There are upper and lower limits to the size of food a carnivorous animal can eat. The size of an animal and its feeding mechanism puts some upper limit on the size of food it can take into its mouth. And except in a few cases, large carnivores cannot live on very small food items because they cannot procure enough food in a given time to meet their metabolic needs. Among the exceptions are baleen whales, huge suspension feeders with adaptations that enable them to consume enormous quantities of krill and other small organisms (see FIGURE 41.6).

What Limits the Length of a Food Chain?

Each food chain we can identify in a food web is only a few links long. For example, in the Antarctic web of FIGURE 53.11, there are only four or five links from the producers to any top-level predators. In fact, for all the food webs that ecologists have studied so far, most chains have five or fewer links, although a few are as long as nine links.

Why are food chains relatively short? There are two main hypotheses. The energetic hypothesis is the most widely accepted explanation for food chain length. It suggests that the length of a food chain is limited by the inefficiency of energy transfer along the chain. As we will see in the next chapter, only about 10%  of the energy stored in the organic matter of any trophic level is converted to organic matter at the next trophic level. If we start with 100 kg of plant material, we can support about 10 kg of herbivore production and 1 kg of carnivore production. If this energetic hypothesis is correct, food chains should be longer in habitats of higher photosynthetic productivity, a prediction that can be tested.

A second hypothesis to explain the limited length of food chains is the dynamic stability hypothesis. According to this idea, long food chains are less stable than short chains. Fluctuations at lower trophic levels are magnified at higher levels, potentially causing the extinction of top predators. In a variable environment, top predators must be able to recover from environmental shocks (such as extreme winters) that can reduce the food supply, from producers all the way up the food chain. The longer the food chain, the slower the recovery rate from environmental setbacks for top predators. This hypothesis predicts shorter food chains in unpredictable environments, and this prediction can again be tested by the collection of food chain data.

Most of the data available support the energetic hypothesis as the likely explanation for the shortness of food chains. For example, ecologists have used tree-hole communities in tropical forests as experimental models to test the energetic hypothesis. Many trees have small branch scars that rot to form small holes in the tree trunk. Tree holes hold water and provide habitat for tiny communities sustained by the leaf litter trapped by the water. FIGURE 53.13 shows the results of a set of experiments in which productivity (leaf litter falling into the tree holes) was manipulated. As predicted by the energetic hypothesis, holes with the most leaf litter, and hence the greatest total food supply at the producer level, supported the longest food chains.

Fig 53-13. Test of the energetic hypothesis for the restriction on food chain length. Researchers manipulated the productivity of tree-hole communities in Queensland, Australia, with leaf litter input at three levels: high litter input = natural (control) rate of litter fall; medium = 1/10 natural rate; and low = 1/100 natural rate. Reducing energy input reduced food chain length, a result consistent with the energetic hypothesis. The tree-hole community consists of microbes that break down leaf litter, mosquito larvae that feed on these microbes, predatory midges (chironomids), and other insects that feed directly on leaf litter.





 Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure

Certain species may have an especially large impact on entire communities, either because of their abundance (dominant species) or because of their pivotal roles in community dynamics (keystone species).

Dominant Species

Dominant species are those species in a community that have the highest abundance or highest biomass (the sum weight of all individuals in a population). They exert a powerful control over the occurrence and distribution of other species. For example, the sugar maple is the dominant plant species in many forest communities in eastern North America, and the abundance of maples has a major impact on abiotic factors such as shading and soil, which affect the entire forest community.

Why do some species become dominant in a community? According to one hypothesis, species that are most competitive in exploiting limited resources such as water or nutrients are the most likely species to become dominant. But a competitive edge in resource use may not be the only explanation for why a species becomes dominant. In some communities, a dominant species may owe its abundance to greater success than other potential dominants at avoiding predators.

What happens if we remove a dominant species from a community? Humans have carried out this type of experiment many times by accident. The American chestnut was a dominant tree in the eastern deciduous forests of North America before 1910, making up more than 40%  of the canopy (top-story) trees. This species is now absent as a canopy tree as a result of a disease called chestnut blight. This fungal disease attacks only chestnut trees. Humans accidentally introduced the fungus to New York City in 1910 on nursery stock imported from Asia. The pathogen has only a weak impact on Chinese chestnuts, but is lethal to American chestnuts. Between 1910 and 1950, chestnut blight killed all the chestnut trees in eastern North America. Thus, what had been the dominant tree of many of these eastern forests was eliminated. How did this affect the overall forest communities? The impact of removing the dominant species was actually small, at least as far as researchers can tell. The forests have filled in with various species of oaks, hickories, beech, and red maple, and these trees have increased in abundance and replaced the chestnut. Some species of insects, however, were affected. Fifty-six species of moths and butterflies fed on the American chestnut. Of these, 7 species became extinct, but the other 49 species did not rely exclusively on the chestnut for food, and they still survive. No mammals or birds seem to have been seriously affected by this loss of a dominant species. In communities in which dominance is achieved by competitive ability, the loss of a dominant may not have a great effect, because one or more other species with slightly less competitive ability may take over the role of the dominant. This is an example of an outcome predicted by the redundancy model of community structure.

Keystone Species

In contrast to dominant species, most keystone species are not especially abundant in a community. They exert strong control on community structure not so much by numerical might as by their ecological roles, or niches. One of the best ways to recognize keystone species is by removal experiments, which is exactly how ecologist Robert Paine first developed the concept of keystone species. The sea star Pisaster ochraceous is a keystone predator of mussels in rocky intertidal communities of western North America (FIGURE 53.14a). When Paine removed Pisaster manually from rocky intertidal areas, the mussel Mytilus californianus was able to monopolize space and exclude other invertebrates and algae from attachment sites (FIGURE 53.14b). M. californianus is a dominant species, a superior competitor for open space in the rocky intertidal zone. Predation by Pisaster offsets this competitive edge and allows other species to use the space vacated by Mytilus. Pisaster is not able to eliminate mussels entirely because Mytilus can grow too large to be eaten by the sea star. Size-limited predation provides some refuge for this prey species, and these large mussels are able to produce large numbers of fertilized eggs that help recolonize vacant space on the rocks. Paine observed that when sea stars are present, 15 to 20 species of invertebrates and algae occur in the intertidal zone. But after experimental removal of Pisaster, species diversity quickly declines to less than 5 species because the mussel, unchecked by the keystone predator, is able to monopolize space. Thus, the important role of Pisaster is not reflected in its abundance.

Sea otters, a keystone predator in the North Pacific, offer another example. Once relatively abundant, they were reduced to near extinction by the fur trade during the 19th century. An international treaty provided protection in the 20th century, enabling sea otter populations to recover to very high densities. Sea otters feed on sea urchins, and sea urchins feed mainly on kelp. In areas where sea otters are abundant, sea urchins are rare and kelp forests are well developed. Where sea otters are rare, sea urchins are common and kelp is almost absent. During the last 20 years, sea otters have declined precipitously in large areas off the coast of western Alaska (FIGURE 53.15), sometimes at rates of 25%  per year. The loss of this keystone species has allowed sea urchin populations to increase, resulting in the destruction of kelp forests. Ecologists suspect that killer whales are the cause of the sea otter decline. Killer whales have probably been eating sea otters for the past two decades because the previous prey of the whales, mainly seals and sea lions, have declined in density. And the decline of these prey species reflects a decline in the populations of fish species that the seals and sea lions eat. And all of these changes in these Alaskan marine communities have probably rippled from human overfishing in the North Pacific. From case studies such as these, ecologists are just beginning to outline the key interactions that help structure aquatic and terrestrial communities.

The graphs correlate changes in (a) sea otter abundance over time with changes in two factors; (b) sea urchin biomass and (c) changes in kelp density measured from kelp forests at Adak Island (part of the Aleutian Island chain). The food chains alongside the graphs illustrate a hypothesis for a change in kelp forest communities due to killer whales preying on sea otters.





 The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators

Simplified models based on relationships between adjacent trophic levels are useful for discussing how communities of plants, animals, and other organisms might be organized. For example, consider the three possible relationships between plants (V for vegetation) and herbivores (H): The arrows indicate that a change in the biomass (total weight) of one trophic level causes a change in the other trophic level. For example, VH means that an increase in vegetation will impact (increase) the numbers or biomass of herbivores, but not vice versa. In this situation, herbivores are limited by vegetation, but vegetation is not limited by herbivory. In contrast, VH means that an increase in herbivore biomass will have an impact on vegetation (decreasing it), but not vice versa. A double arrow indicates that feedback flows in both directions, with each trophic level sensitive to changes in the biomass of the other.

Based on these possible interactions, we can distinguish two models of community organization: the bottom-up model and the top-down model. The bottom-up model postulates VH linkages. In this case, mineral nutrients (N) control community organization because the nutrients control plant (V) numbers, which control herbivore (H) numbers, which in turn control predator (P) numbers. The simplified bottom-up model is thus NVHP. If you want to change the community structure of a bottom-up community, you need to alter biomass at the lower trophic levels. For example, if you add mineral nutrients to stimulate growth of vegetation, then all the other trophic levels should also increase in biomass. But if you add predators or remove predators from a bottom-up community, the effect will not extend down to the lower trophic levels.

In contrast, the top-down model postulates that it is mainly predation that controls community organization because predators control herbivores, which in turn control plants, which in turn control nutrient levels. The simplified top-down model is thus NVHP. This top-down control of community structure is also called the trophic cascade model. It predicts a cascade of +/- effects down the trophic levels. Increasing predators will depress herbivore numbers, the depressed herbivore numbers will have a reduced impact on plant abundance, and the abundant plants will depress levels of mineral nutrients. For example, in a lake community with four trophic levels, the trophic cascade model predicts that removing the top carnivores will increase the abundance of primary carnivores, decrease herbivores, increase phytoplankton, and eventually decrease concentrations of mineral nutrients. If there were only three trophic levels in a lake, removing the primary carnivores would increase the herbivores and decrease the phytoplankton, causing nutrient levels to rise. The effects of any manipulation will thus move down the trophic structure as a series of +/- effects.

Many other models intermediate between the bottom-up and top-down extremes are possible. For example, all the interactions between trophic levels could be reciprocal (). The value of these simplified models is that they provide a starting point for the analysis of communities. Let's look at one example where ecologists have applied these models to counter pollution problems in lakes.

Pollution has degraded the freshwater lakes in many countries. Because many freshwater lake communities seem to be structured according to the top-down, or trophic cascade, model, ecologists have a potential method for improving water quality. In lakes with four trophic levels, for example, adding top predators should improve water quality by reducing algal populations. In lakes with three trophic levels, removing fish should improve water quality. We can summarize this strategy for lake restoration, called biomanipulation, with this diagram.






One of the largest biomanipulations of food webs so far was the Lake Vesij&auml;rvi experiment in southern Finland. Vesij&auml;rvi is a large (110 km2), shallow lake that was heavily polluted with city sewage and industrial wastewater until 1976. Pollution controls then stopped these inputs, and the lake began to recover in water quality. But by 1986, massive blooms of cyanobacteria began to occur. These algal blooms coincided with a very dense population of roach, a plankton-eating fish that had accumulated during the years of mineral nutrient (pollution) input. Roach eat zooplankton, and by reducing zooplankton, they also reduced herbivory on cyanobacteria and other algae, which then increased in abundance. To reverse these changes, ecologists removed 1,018 tons of fish from Lake Vesijrvi between 1989 and 1993, reducing roach to about 20%  of their former abundance. At the same time, the ecologists began to stock the lake with pike perch, a predatory fish that eats roach. This added a fourth trophic level to the lake. Biomanipulation was a success in Lake Vesijrvi. The water became clear, and cyanobacterial blooms ended in 1989. The lake continues to remain clear even though the roach removal was stopped in 1993.

Communities will vary in the relative degree of top-down and bottom-up control, and we should not assume that one model will fit all communities. If humans are to manage agricultural landscapes, national parks, reservoirs, and marine fisheries, we need to understand the dynamics of the community we are attempting to manage. This is just one example of how basic ecological research can help us evaluate environmental issues.





 Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances

Disturbances are events, such as storms, fire, floods, droughts, overgrazing, or human activities, that damage communities, remove organisms from them, and alter resource availability. The types of disturbances and their frequency and severity vary from community to community. Storms disturb almost all communities, even those in deep oceans. Fire is a significant cause of disturbance in most terrestrial communities; grasslands and chaparral biomes are dependent on regular burning (FIGURE 53.16). Freezing is a frequent occurrence in many rivers, lakes, and ponds, and many streams and ponds are disturbed by spring flooding and seasonal drying. Disturbances often create opportunities for species that have not previously occupied habitats to become established. By gathering data from specific communities over many years, ecologists are beginning to appreciate and understand the impact of disturbances. Let's look at one example.

Fig 53-16. Routine disturbance in a grassland community. Historically, prairie grasslands were often swept by fire. These photographs were taken (a) before, (b) during, and (c) after a controlled burn conducted by ecologists studying the long-term effects of fire on a tallgrass prairie in Kansas. (The trees in the photographs were growing along a stream and were not burned during the study.) (a) Before a controlled burn. A prairie that has not burned for several years has a high proportion of detritus (dead grass). (b) During. The detritus serves as fuel for fires. (c) After. Prairies regrow rapidly after a fire burns the detritus. Approximately one month after the controlled burn, virtually all of the biomass in this prairie was living.

The marine communities called coral reefs are subject to a variety of physical disturbances associated with tropical storms. At Heron Island Reef, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland, Australia, ecologists used sequential sets of photographs to chronicle changes in coral cover at specific sites over a 30-year period. The scientists measured the area covered by colonies of live coral to estimate the abundance of the coral animals (see Chapter 33). The researchers also measured the "recruitment" of coral animal larvae that settle and found new colonies.

Violent storms were the main type of disturbance to Heron Island Reef, and the amount of damage caused by these cyclones depended on the position of the coral colonies on the reef (FIGURE 53.17). Sites exposed more to the open ocean were more subject to wave damage than sites sheltered by the island. Five cyclones passed near Heron Island during the 30 years of study from 1962 to 1992. Of the four study areas graphed in FIGURE 53.17, only the protected area of the inner flat was relatively unaffected by cyclones. Almost every cyclone caused a reduction in coral cover in the exposed pools. The 1972 cyclone completely removed coral cover on the exposed crest ("peak" of the reef), the most severe disturbance observed. Recovery on the exposed crest was slow for the next 25 years.

Fig 53-17. Storm disturbance to coral reef communities. The graphs compare how five tropical cyclones (red arrows) affected coral cover at four regions of the Heron Island Reef in Australia. Damage from cyclones was highly variable, depending on how well the island protected the four sites. (The gradual decline in coral cover at the protected sites was a normal effect of the coral's upward growth, which increased the exposure of these sites to air over the 30 years of the study.)

Recruitment rates of new corals settling on free surfaces were highly variable, and this is typical of many marine invertebrates whose larvae drift in the plankton before settling. During the 30-year Heron Island Reef study, there were no particularly good or bad years for coral recruitment for an area as a whole. Recruitment rate was partly associated with how much free space there was in different areas. Coral larvae need free space to settle because they cannot attach to other living coral or to seaweeds.

What emerges from this case study is a picture of a coral community that changes continually because of the disturbance caused by tropical cyclones and the internal processes of growth and recruitment. Coral reefs are good examples of nonequilibrium communities. And there is mounting evidence that some amount of nonequilibrium resulting from disturbance is the norm for most communities. Communities are often in some state of recovery from disturbance.

We tend to think of disturbance as having a negative impact on communities, but this is not always the case. Small-scale disturbances sometimes enhance environmental patchiness, which can be important to the maintenance of species diversity in a community. Frequent small-scale disturbances can also prevent large-scale disturbances. The major fires that occurred in Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 1988 are an example of what can happen in the absence of smaller disturbances. Much of this park was dominated by lodgepole pine, a tree that requires the rejuvenating influence of periodic fires. Lodgepole cones remain closed until exposed to intense heat. When a forest fire destroys the parent trees, the cones open and the seeds are released. The new generation of lodgepole pines can then thrive on nutrients released from the burned trees and on the direct sunlight that was blocked by the old forest. Lodgepole pines that are over 100 years old become increasingly flammable, but for decades, fire suppression by humans had prevented small lightning-induced fires in Yellowstone Park that would have resulted in patches of less flammable trees. As a result, by 1988, about one-third of the Yellowstone trees were 250 to 300 years old. The drought conditions of 1988, combined with the fuel that had accumulated in the forests, resulted in a large-scale fire that destroyed the old lodgepole forests. Demonstrating that communities can often respond very rapidly to even such massive disturbance, burned areas in Yellowstone were largely covered with new vegetation the following year (FIGURE 53.18).

This photo of the same general area taken the following year indicates how rapidly the com-munity began to recover. A variety of herbaceous plants, different from the species that inhabited the floor of the former forest, cover the ground.





 Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance

Of all the animals, humans have the greatest impact on communities worldwide. Logging and clearing for urban development, mining, and farming have reduced large tracts of forests to small patches of disconnected woodlots in many parts of the United States and throughout Europe. Similarly, agricultural development has disrupted what were once the vast grasslands of the North American prairie. After forests are clear-cut and left alone, weedy and shrubby vegetation often colonizes the area and dominates it for many years. This type of vegetation is also found extensively in agricultural fields that are no longer under cultivation and in vacant lots and construction sites that are periodically cleared. Human disturbance of communities is by no means limited to the United States and Europe; nor is it a recent problem. Tropical rain forests are quickly disappearing as a result of clear-cutting for lumber and pastureland. And centuries of overgrazing and agricultural disturbance have contributed to the current famine in parts of Africa by turning seasonal grasslands into great barren areas.

Human disturbance usually reduces species diversity in communities. We currently use about 60%  of Earth's land in one way or another, mostly as cropland, forest, and rangeland. Most crops are grown in monocultures, intensive cultivations of a single plant variety over large areas. Even forests used to produce pulpwood and lumber are often replanted in single-species stands. And the effects of intensive grazing on rangelands often include the removal of several native plant species and replacement with only a few introduced species. In Chapter 55, we will take a closer look at how community disturbance by human activities is affecting the diversity of life.





 Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance

Changes in community composition and structure are most apparent after some disturbance, such as a large fire or a volcanic eruption, strips away the existing vegetation. The disturbed area may be colonized by a variety of species, which are gradually replaced by a succession of other species. Such transitions in species composition over ecological time represent a process called ecological succession. The process is called primary succession if it begins in a virtually lifeless area where soil has not yet formed, such as on a new volcanic island or on the rubble (moraine) left behind by a retreating glacier. Often the only life-forms initially present are autotrophic bacteria. Lichens and mosses, which grow from windblown spores, are commonly the first macroscopic photosynthesizers to colonize such areas. Soil develops gradually, as rocks weather and organic matter accumulates from the decomposed remains of the early colonizers. Once soil is present, the lichens and mosses are usually overgrown by other plants, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees that sprout from seeds blown in from nearby areas or carried in by animals. Eventually, an area may be colonized by plants that become the community's prevalent form of vegetation. For primary succession to produce such a community may take hundreds or thousands of years.

Secondary succession occurs where an existing community has been cleared by some disturbance that leaves the soil intact. Succession in Yellowstone following the 1988 fires is an example (see FIGURE 53.18). Often the area begins to return to something like its original state. For instance, forested areas that are cleared for farming will, if abandoned, undergo secondary succession and may eventually return to forest. The earliest plants to recolonize such an area are often herbaceous species that grow from windblown or animal-borne seeds. If the area is not burned or heavily grazed, woody shrubs may in time replace most of the herbaceous species, and forest trees may eventually replace most of the shrubs.

Three key processes may be involved in succession between the early arrivals and the later arriving species. The early arrivals may facilitate, or contribute to, the appearance of the later species by making the environment more favorable for the later species. For example, they might make the soil more fertile. Alternatively, the early species may inhibit establishment of the later species, so that the later species colonize successfully in spite of, rather than because of, the activities of the early species. Finally, the early species may be completely independent of the later species, so that they tolerate the later species but do not help or hinder colonization by the later arrivals. Let's look at how these various processes contribute to primary succession in one specific example.

During the past 300 years, there has been a gradual retreat of glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. As the glaciers retreat, they leave moraines. Researchers can determine the age of these postglaciation areas of moraine from the age of the new trees growing on the moraine or, in the last 80 years, by direct observation. Ecologists have conducted the most extensive research on moraine succession at Glacier Bay, in southeastern Alaska. Since about 1760, the glaciers there have retreated about 98 km, an extraordinary retreat rate of almost 400 m per year (FIGURE 53.19). Rocky moraines form a nearly pristine but harsh environment for plants to colonize.

Fig 53-19. A glacial retreat in southeastern Alaska. The dated locations chronicle recession of the glacier since 1760. The broken lines show the approximate edge of the ice in 1760 and 1860, based on historical descriptions. As the ice retreats, it leaves moraines along the edge of the bay (left inset). Primary succession occurs on the moraines (right inset).

TABLE 53.2 summarizes the pattern of succession on the moraines in Glacier Bay. The exposed moraine is colonized first by pioneering plant species--mosses, fireweed, Dryas (a herbaceous angiosperm), willows, and cottonwood. In a few decades, the area is invaded by alder (Alnus), which eventually forms dense, pure thickets up to 9 m tall. These alder stands are later invaded by Sitka spruce, which, after another century, forms a dense forest. Western hemlock and mountain hemlock invade the spruce stands, and after another century, the community is a spruce-hemlock forest. This forest, however, will endure on well-drained slopes only. In areas of poor drainage, the forest floor of this spruce-hemlock forest is invaded by sphagnum mosses, which hold large amounts of water and acidify the soil. With the spread of conditions associated with sphagnum, the trees die because the soil is waterlogged and too oxygen-deficient to sustain the trees' roots, and the area becomes a sphagnum bog. Thus, by about 300 years after glacial retreat, the vegetation consists of sphagnum bogs on the poorly drained flat areas and spruce-hemlock forest on the well-drained slopes.

The bare soil exposed as the glacier retreats is quite basic, with a pH of 8.0-8.4 because of the carbonates contained in the parent rocks. The soil pH falls rapidly with the arrival of vegetation, and the rate of change depends on the vegetation type. The most striking change is caused by alder, which reduces the pH from 8.0 to 5.0 in 30 to 50 years. The leaves of alder are slightly acidic, and as they decompose, they become even more acidic. As the spruce begins to take over from the alder, the pH stabilizes at about 5.0, and it does not change for the next 150 years.

The soil concentrations of mineral nutrients also show marked changes with time. FIGURE 53.20, for example, shows the changes in soil nitrogen levels. One of the characteristic features of the bare soil after glacial retreat is its low nitrogen content. Almost all the pioneer species begin the succession with very poor growth and yellow leaves due to inadequate nitrogen supply. The exceptions to this are Dryas and, particularly, alder; these species have symbiotic bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen (see Chapter 37). Soil nitrogen increases rapidly during the alder stage of succession. The spruce forest develops by spending the capital of soil nitrogen accumulated by the alder. But because spruce trees do not have nitrogen-fixing symbionts, the concentration of soil nitrogen declines again.

Fig 53-20. Change in soil nitrogen concentration during succession after glacial retreat in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Plant succession is shown along the top.

Both inhibition and facilitation factor into primary succession on glacial moraines. One way to test experimentally for these processes is to sow seeds of the later successional species into the earlier stages of succession. When seeds of alder and Sitka spruce were sown into the early successional stages at Glacier Bay, they were inhibited in their germination, and the survival of seedlings that did geminate was reduced. Inhibition seems to be the dominant process in the early successional stages. But once alder and Dryas have enriched the soil with nitrogen, Sitka spruce uses this nitrogen for growth, so it is facilitated by the pioneer species. The pioneer plants alter the soil properties, which in turn permit new species to grow, and these species in turn alter the environment in different ways, contributing to succession.





 Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance

The biodiversity of a community--the variety of different kinds of organisms that make up the community--has two components. One is species richness, or the total number of different species in the community. The other is the relative abundance of the different species. For example, imagine two small forest communities, each with 100 individuals distributed among four different tree species (A, B, C, and D) as follows:

Community 1: 25A, 25B, 25C, 25D

Community 2: 80A, 10B, 5C, 5D

The species richness is the same for both communities because they both contain four species, but the relative abundance is very different (FIGURE 53.21). You would easily notice the four different types of trees in community 1, but without looking carefully, you might see only the abundant species A in the second forest. Most observers would intuitively describe community 1 as the more diverse of the two communities. Indeed, ecologists measure biodiversity as heterogeneity, which considers both diversity factors: richness and relative abundance.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 53-21. Which forest is more diverse? Both forests have the same four tree species (A, B, C, and D). Thus, the two communities are equal in their species richness of trees. But if we factor in the relative abundance of species, then community 1 seems more diverse because of the more equitable representation of the different tree species. Ecologists would say that community 1 has greater heterogeneity, a measure of diversity that includes both species number (richness) and relative abundance.

Counting species in a community to determine their number and relative abundances is easier said than done, especially for insects and other small organisms. The counts usually involve sampling techniques. But sample sizes are generally small, leading to large sampling errors, because most species in a community are relatively rare. FIGURE 53.22 illustrates this problem for a study of butterfly and moth biodiversity in a community. And measuring biodiversity is relatively easy when we are counting birds and butterflies. It is much harder to count the less charismatic members of communities, such as mites and nematodes.

Fig 53-22. Relative abundance of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) captured in a light trap in Rothamsted, England. The trap caught a total of 6,814 individuals, representing 197 species. The six most common species accounted for 50 percent of the total catch. In fact, a single species accounted for 1,799 of the 6,814 moths (note that this most common species is "off-scale" on the graph, which does not extend much beyond species represented by about 40 individuals). The main point of the graph is that the majority of species are rare. For example, 37 of the 197 total species were represented in the catch by only a single specimen.

Challenging as it is to measure biodiversity in a community--even for just one taxonomic category, such as butterflies--it is very important work. Measuring biodiversity is essential for conservation biology, since we need an inventory of what we hope to protect. Though there is a tendency in biology to focus on individual species, community ecologists tend to lump the species into broader categories, such as the bird species or the tree species of an area. We can use this community-based approach to look for large-scale patterns in the biogeography of biodiversity.





 Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient

Tropical habitats support much larger numbers of species of plants, animals, and other organisms than do temperate and polar regions. A few examples from biodiversity studies will illustrate this global gradient. A 50 ha (1 hectare = 10,000 m2) plot of tropical rain forest in Malaysia contained 830 species of trees, and a 6.6 ha area in Sarawak (in Malaysia) contained 711 tree species. Contrast this richness with a deciduous forest in Michigan, which contained 10 to 15 species on a plot of 2 ha. And the whole of Europe north of the Alps has only 50 tree species. Ants are also much more diverse in the tropics. There are over 200 species of ants in Brazil, 73 species in Iowa, and 7 species in Alaska. There are 293 species of snakes in Mexico, 126 in the United States, and 22 in Canada. FIGURE 53.23 maps the number of breeding land bird species in different parts of North and Central America. Over 600 bird species occur in Central America, while arctic Canada has less than 40 species of birds. Freshwater fishes have their greatest diversity in tropical rivers and lakes. Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi in East Africa contain about 1,450 species of fishes. Over 1,000 species of fishes have been found in the Amazon River in South America, and exploration is still incomplete in this region. In contrast, Central America has 456 fish species, and the Great Lakes of North America have 173 species. Lake Baikal, in Asia, has 39 fish species; and Great Bear Lake, in northwestern Canada, has only 14 species of fishes.

What causes these equatorial-polar gradients in species richness? The two key factors are probably evolutionary history and climate. On the scale of evolutionary time, species diversity may increase in a community because more speciation events have occurred. And tropical communities are generally older than temperate or polar communities. This age difference is partly a consequence of the much longer growing season in the tropics. The growing season in tropical forests is about five times longer than the growing season in the tundra communities of high latitudes. In effect, biological time, and hence time for speciation, runs about five times faster in the tropics than near the poles. And many polar and temperate communities have had to "start over" several times as a result of major disturbance in the form of glaciations.

Most ecologists see climate as the major explanation for the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity. And the two main climatic factors correlated with biodiversity are solar energy input and water availability. Solar energy is the source of both light and heat, two variables that impact the growth of vegetation. The water factor includes both precipitation and humidity.

One way to integrate the energy and water factors of climate is to measure the rate of a community's evapotranspiration, the evaporation of water from soil plus the transpiration of water from plants (see Chapter 36). Evapotranspiration is much higher in hot areas with abundant rainfall than in areas with low temperatures or low precipitation. The species richness of both plants and animals correlates with evapotranspiration (FIGURE 53.24).

Species richness of (a) trees and (b) vertebrates from North America are related to annual available energy at each site, measured by evapotranspiration (which combines solar radiation and temperature). The evapotranspiration values are expressed as their rainfall equivalents in millimeters per year.





 Species richness is related to a community's geographic size

One of the earliest biodiversity patterns that scientists recognized is called the species-area curve, which quantifies what probably seems obvious: The larger the geographic area of a community we sample, the greater the number of species. Alexander von Humboldt first described this relationship in 1807, based on his explorations. The probable explanation for species-area curves is that larger areas offer a greater diversity of habitats and microhabitats (see Chapter 50). In conservation biology, developing species-area curves for key taxa in a community makes it possible to predict how loss of a certain area of habitat is likely to affect biodiversity.

FIGURE 53.25 (p. 1194) is a species-area curve for the breeding birds of North America. The slope indicates the extent to which species richness increases with community area. The slopes of different species-area curves vary, depending on the taxon being sampled in the biodiversity survey and the type of community. But the basic concept of increasing diversity with increasing area applies in a variety of situations, from surveys of ant diversity in New Guinea to the number of plant species on islands of different sizes. In fact, island biogeography provides some of the best examples of species-area curves.

 Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland

Because of their limited size and isolation, islands provide excellent opportunities for studying some of the biogeographic factors that affect the species diversity of communities. By "islands," we mean not only oceanic islands, but also habitat islands on land, such as lakes, mountain peaks separated by lowlands, or natural woodland fragments surrounded by areas disturbed by humans--in other words, any patch surrounded by an environment not suitable for the "island" species. In the 1960s, American ecologists Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson developed a general hypothesis of island biogeography to identify the important determinants of species diversity on an island with a given set of physical characteristics.

Imagine a newly formed oceanic island some distance from a mainland that will serve as a source of colonizing species. Two factors will determine the number of species that eventually inhabit the island: the rate at which new species immigrate to the island and the rate at which species become extinct on the island. And two physical features of the island affect immigration and extinction rates: its size and its distance from the mainland. Small islands will generally have lower immigration rates, because potential colonizers are less likely to reach a small island. For example, birds blown out to sea by a storm are more likely to land by chance on a larger island than on a small one. Small islands will also have higher extinction rates. They generally contain fewer resources and less diverse habitats for colonizing species to partition, increasing the likelihood of chance losses. Distance from the mainland is also important; for two islands of equal size, a closer island will have a higher immigration rate than one farther away.

The immigration and extinction rates are also affected at any given time by the number of species already present on the island. As the number of species on the island increases, the immigration rate of new species decreases, because any individual reaching the island is less likely to represent a species that is not already present. At the same time, as more species inhabit an island, extinction rates on the island increase because of the greater likelihood of competitive exclusion.

These relationships that make up MacArthur and Wilson's hypothesis of island biogeography are summarized in FIGURE 53.26. Immigration and extinction rates are plotted as a function of the number of species present on the island. The main prediction of this model is that eventually an equilibrium will be reached where the rate of species immigration matches the rate of species extinction. The number of species at this equilibrium point is correlated with the island's size and distance from the mainland. Any ecological equilibrium, of course, is dynamic; immigration and extinction continue, and the exact species composition may change over time.

MacArthur and Wilson's studies of the diversity of plants and animals on many island chains, such as the Gal&eacute;pagos Islands, support the prediction that species richness increases with island size, in keeping with species-area theory (FIGURE 53.27). Species counts also fit the prediction that the number of species decreases with increasing remoteness of the island.

In the past several decades, the island biogeography hypothesis has come under considerable fire as an oversimplification. Its predictions of equilibria in the species composition of communities may apply in only a limited number of cases and over relatively short time periods, where colonization is the main process affecting species composition. Over a longer period, abiotic disturbances such as storms, adaptive evolutionary changes, and speciation generally alter the species composition and community structure on islands. More important than whether the island biogeography hypothesis has widespread applicability is that it stimulated discussion and research on the effects of habitat size on species diversity, a topic of vital importance for conservation biology, to which we will turn when we discuss habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss in Chapter 55.
