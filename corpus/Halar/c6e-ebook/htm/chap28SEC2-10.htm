Two of these groups of flagellates, the euglenoids and the kinetoplastids, make up the clade labeled Euglenozoa in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.8</span>.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">euglenoids</span> (Euglenophyta, such as <span class="Emphasis1">Euglena</span> and its close relatives) are characterized by an anterior pocket, or chamber, from which one or two flagella emerge. Paramylon, a glucose polymer that functions as a storage molecule, is also characteristic of euglenoids. <span class="Emphasis1">Euglena</span>, the organism in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.3</span>, is chiefly autotrophic. However, many euglenoids are mixotrophic or heterotrophic, absorbing organic molecules from their surroundings or engulfing prey by phagocytosis.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">kinetoplastids</span> (Kinetoplastida) have a single large mitochondrion associated with a unique organelle, the kinetoplast, that houses extranuclear DNA. The kinetoplastids are symbiotic, and some are pathogenic to their hosts. For example, species of <span class="Emphasis1">Trypanosoma</span> cause African sleeping sickness, a human disease that is spread by the bite of the tsetse fly (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.11</span>). Sleeping sickness is a debilitating disease common in parts of Africa. Trypanosomes escape being killed by the host’s defenses by being quick-change artists. They alter the molecular structure of their coats frequently, thus preventing immunity from developing in the host.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-11','../fig/big/fig28-11.jpg','fig28-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-11.jpg" alt="fig28-11" name="myfig28-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Trypanosoma</span>, the kinetoplastid that causes sleeping sickness.</span> The squiggles among these red blood cells are the trypanosomes (colorized SEM).</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
