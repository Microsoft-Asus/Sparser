WASHINGTON --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Federal law-enforcement officials said Saturday that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate of Osama bin Laden , a wealthy Saudi -born businessman who has vowed to wage a holy war against the United States , to the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania</ENAMEX> .
The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence connecting Bin Laden to the bombings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But Saturday 's issue of Newsday reported that a witness had identified an associate of Bin Laden as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that heavily damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya</ENAMEX> and killed more than 200 people .
The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of the bombing .
In interviews Saturday , intelligence and law-enforcement officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said there was no certain identification of the suspect , described as a relatively low-level member of Bin Laden 's circle .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But officials indicated that this was the first potential evidentiary link to Bin Laden , who the FBI and CIA have suspected from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot</ENAMEX> .
U<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">.S. officials have said since the early hours of the investigation that the suspect at the top of their list was Bin Laden</ENAMEX> , who this year renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the United States .
Senior U.S. officials have said that he has a network in Africa , and that U.S. intelligence had evidence that he has operatives in Kenya .
But officials previously cautioned that there has been no hard evidence linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings .
Still , U.S. officials point to the nearly simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 as indicating that the attack was carried off by sophisticated terrorists .
Bin Laden 's network is one that has the financial resources and the organizational skills for such a coordinated attack , the officials said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Another group under suspicion by the United States is the Islamic Jihad , based in Cairo , Egypt , but that organization is also financed by Bin Laden , U.S. officials said</ENAMEX> .
The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the construction business , Bin Laden is thought to have been involved in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia .
But the United States has never issued an arrest warrant for Bin Laden because of lack of evidence .
Bin Laden lived for a time in Sudan .
He is said to live in Afghanistan now , under the protection of the Taliban , the militant Islamic group that controls most of the country .
Law -enforcement officials said Bin Laden had become the subject of an intense internal discussion at the FBI over whether the New York office should take jurisdiction of the bombing case away from the Washington field office , which has jurisdiction over crimes against Americans in Africa .
FBI officials in New York have argued that they have investigated Bin Laden in connection with the World Trade Center bombing , and therefore should take over the Nairobi and Dar es Salaam bombings in the event that he is found to be involved .
Also on Saturday , a British newspaper , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Glasgow Herald , reported that the Pakistani secret service is holding a suspect in connection with the embassy bombings and is hunting two others</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A U.S. official in Pakistan said that a Pakistani newspaper had also reported the arrest of a suspect</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The newspaper report cited unidentified Pakistani intelligence officials as saying Mohammed Sadiq , 32 , was detained at Karachi international airport when he arrived on a Pakistan International Airways flight from Kenya on Aug. 7 , the day of the bombings</ENAMEX> .
Sadiq was held when he presented a false passport at customs , the newspaper said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The officials were quoted as saying that another suspect was in hiding in Pakistan and that a third was in Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">All three suspects were said to have been en route to Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , having flown out of Kenya before the bombs went off .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">One of the three , suspected to be a bomb maker , was believed to have left Kenya on Aug. 4 , three days before the explosions and was probably now in Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , The Glasgow Herald reported .
President Clinton , in an address videotaped for broadcast overseas , said that the Kenyans and Tanzanians killed in the bombings `` were important to America because we cherish our friendship with your peoples . ''
At least 247 Kenyans and 10 Tanzanians died in the explosions .
More than 5,000 people were wounded .
`` Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our united efforts to bring peace to every part of the earth , '' Clinton said .
`` We grieve together , but I am proud that our nations have also renewed our commitment to stand together . ''
