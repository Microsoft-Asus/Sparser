GALASHKI , Russia --
High on a fog-covered ridge overlooking the mountainous border with Chechnya , a battery of Russian self-propelled guns let loose another withering salvo , presumably aimed at Islamic rebel bases on the other side .
Underneath the guns in the town of Galashki , well inside territory friendly to Russia , they are not so sure .
During a heavy bombardment Monday , a Russian rocket landed near the village ; luckily it failed to explode .
It was the latest of several misfires and other incidents involving the Russian troops that locals are beginning to doubt are accidental .
`` I thought the federal troops came here to fight Chechens , '' said Magomed Khasiyev , mayor of Galashki , as he inspected the rocket Monday .
`` But it looks like they are shooting at us , too . ''
As the Caucasus erupts in the heaviest fighting since the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya , Khasiyev 's comments illustrate a tricky aspect of Russia 's effort to bring order to its restive southern rim with the blunt and often inaccurate instrument that is the Russian military .
The more military force Moscow brings to bear against suspected Islamic terrorists it says are hiding in Chechnya , the more likely become the chances of destabilizing other provinces in its volatile north Caucasus region .
The errant battery is part of a force of up to 50,000 Russian troops , tanks , artillery , and warplanes that began pounding Chechnya after Muslim militants invaded neighboring Dagestan to the east in August and September .
Monday , Russian federal troops and Chechen forces were locked in heavy fighting north of Grozny , the capital of the separatist region .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said the point of the operation is to protect regions surrounding Chechnya from attacks by the militants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">That is well enough for Ingushetia , a Russian republic just to the west of Chechnya , the site of numerous hit-and-run attacks by gunmen operating out of the separatist region</ENAMEX> .
The motorized brigade above Galashki that is supposed to be protecting its Ingush residents has also been terrorizing them .
`` The troops are drunk all the time , '' said an Ingush policeman at a checkpoint near the Russian guns .
`` When they drive up in their armored personel carries , we just get out of the way . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A tiny Muslim republic of 300,000 with strong cultural , historical , and linguistic ties to Chechnya , Ingushetia chose to stay with Russia when Chechnya declared independence in 1991 and stay out of the 1994-1996 war that killed tens of thousands in the breakaway region .
But as a new outbreak of fighting between Russian and Chechen forces intensifies , tensions in Ingushetia are growing , too</ENAMEX> .
`` There are bandits on both sides and we are in the middle , '' said Azamat Nalgiyev , a member of Ingushetia 's parliament .
`` We are afraid of provocations from both sides . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Many people in Ingushetia buy into the theory that the Kremlin has stirred up the conflict in the Caucasus as part of a sinister plot to help Putin win the presidency next year , or to create an excuse to cancel elections altogether .
The Ingush fear a new outbreak of violence in their longstanding feud with North Ossetia , a mostly Orthodox Christian region to the west .
They resent the crackdown in Moscow and other Russian cities against Chechens and other people from the Caucasus , which is aimed at them as well .
They see 100,000 refugees from the fighting in Chechnya , straining the already meager resources of one of Russia 's poorest regions</ENAMEX> .
And they remember that Stalin exiled the Ingush along with the Chechens in 1944 , after declaring both peoples `` criminal nations . ''
Nalgiyev , who was 3 when he and his parents were put on a boxcar and sent to Kazakhstan , where the Ingush spent 12 years in exile , is still bitter .
So are many other Ingush .
Outside Galashki Monday , the Russian brigade was battle-ready and moving toward Chechnya .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">During the last war , several Ingush were killed when they tried to stop the Russians from attacking Chechnya from their territory .
This time , no one seemed ready to stop them , not after a recent attack on a checkpoint outside town that left four Ingush policemen dead .</ENAMEX>
The gunmen fled toward Chechnya , according to Lieutenant Abubakar Ganduloyev , the checkpoint 's commander .
But the Ingush worry about what a new war will bring .
`` Putin must not have very good advisers , '' commented Ingushetia 's President Ruslan Aushev , a former infantry general and a decorated veteran of the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan .
Putin , who has led the campaign during another of President Boris N. Yeltsin 's protracted disappearances from public , has denied that Russia is planning an all-out military assault .
But the Chechens expect it and the Russian military refuses to deny it , and the military buildup around the region sure looks like it .
`` We will destroy militants with all means at our disposal , '' said Lieutenant General Gennady Troshev , one of the senior Russian commanders in the region , in comments carried on Russian television .
The Russians have taken up positions outside two villages in eastern Chechnya and have ordered all suspected rebels to surrender before they begin a house-to-house search .
The Russians are reportedly negotiating with elders from the village to prevent a fight .
During the last Chechen conflict , however , such standoffs almost always ended with the Russians flattening the town while the rebels got away .
Such heavy-handed tactics lost Russia the hearts and minds of the Chechens , which doomed it to defeat even though its army was much larger and better equipped than the rebels .
As Russia hurtles into a new confrontation with Chechnya , the people on its border wonder whether this time the violence will envelop them as well .
