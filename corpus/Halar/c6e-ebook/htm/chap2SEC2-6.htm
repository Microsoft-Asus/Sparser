These shapes are determined by the positions of the atoms’ orbitals. When an atom forms covalent bonds, the orbitals in its valence shell rearrange. For atoms with valence electrons in both <span class="Emphasis1">s</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> orbitals (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.11</span>), the single <span class="Emphasis1">s</span> and three <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> orbitals hybridize to form four new orbitals shaped like identical teardrops extending from the region of the atomic nucleus (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.17a</span>). If we connect the larger ends of the teardrops with lines, we have the outline of a pyramidal shape called a tetrahedron.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig2-17','../fig/big/fig2-17.jpg','fig2-17');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig2-17.jpg" alt="fig2-17" name="myfig2-17"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 2-17.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Molecular shapes due to hybrid orbitals.

The result is a molecule shaped roughly like a V, its two covalent bonds spread apart at an angle of 104.5&#176;.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The methane molecule (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) has the shape of a completed tetrahedron, because all four hybrid orbitals of carbon are shared (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.17c</span>). The nucleus of the carbon is at the center, with its four covalent bonds radiating to hydrogen nuclei at the corners of the tetrahedron. Larger molecules containing multiple carbon atoms, including many of the molecules that make up living matter, have more complex overall shapes. However, the tetrahedral shape of a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms is often a repeating motif within such molecules.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Molecular shape is crucial in biology because it determines how most biological molecules recognize and respond to one another. For instance, in the chemical signaling example mentioned earlier, the signal molecules released by the transmitting brain cell have a unique shape that specifically fits together with the shape of the receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell, much as a key fits into a lock (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.18</span>). This complementarity of shape aids the formation of weak bonds between the two molecules. The attachment of the signal molecule to the receptor molecule stimulates activity in the receptor cell. Molecules with shapes similar to those of the brain’s signal molecules can affect mood and pain perception. Morphine, heroin, and other opiate drugs, for example, mimic natural signal molecules called endorphins (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.19</span>). These drugs produce euphoria and relieve pain by binding to endorphin receptors in the brain. The role of molecular shape in brain chemistry is an example of the relationship of structure to function, one of biology’s unifying themes.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig2-18','../fig/big/fig2-18.jpg','fig2-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig2-18.jpg" alt="fig2-18" name="myfig2-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 2-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Molecular shape and brain chemistry.</span> One nerve cell in the brain signals another by releasing signal molecules into the gap between the cells.
