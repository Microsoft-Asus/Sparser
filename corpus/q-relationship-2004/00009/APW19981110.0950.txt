-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A decision on a pipeline route for transporting the bulk of Azerbaijan 's Caspian Sea oil to the West has been postponed again , this time until early December , an official said Tuesday .
The international consortium of oil companies eager to cash in on Caspian oil reserves was expected to present its recommendation on the pipeline route to the Azerbaijani government on Nov. 12 .
The final announcement on the route is expected to be made by Azerbaijan 's President Geidar Aliev , but he is almost certain to take the consortium 's recommendation .
The oil consortium 's announcement has been rescheduled until early December , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported , citing the chief of Azerbaijan 's state-run oil company Natik Aliev -- President Aliev 's son .
No reason for the delay was given .
President Aliev favors a proposed pipeline through Georgia and Turkey .
Several U.S. oil companies have invested heavily in the project , and the United States also favors the as-yet-unbuilt Georgia - Turkey route .
An alternate route would go through Iran , a country that Washington considers unstable and therefore does not want to see receiving oil revenues .
But the Iran route would be cheaper , and the oil consortium has reportedly favored that option .
U.S. officials welcomed a past delay on the decision , saying it was a good sign for the Georgia - Turkey route .
Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the Middle East , but they remain relatively untapped because countries with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive projects off the ground and to find a way to export the oil .
A smaller pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia is expected to start pumping small amounts of oil in April .
