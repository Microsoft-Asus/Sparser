Two body forms are sessile polyps and floating medusas. The digestive tract (gastrovascular cavity) is incomplete (has a single opening, the mouth, that also functions as an anus). Class Hydrozoa usually alternates polyp and medusa forms, although the polyp is more conspicuous. In class Scyphozoa, jellies (medusas) are the prevalent forms of the life cycle. Class Anthozoa contains the sea anemones and corals, which occur only as polyps.</p></LI><LI><a name="para58"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Phylum Ctenophora: Comb jellies possess rows of ciliary plates and adhesive colloblasts (pp. 650-651,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Comb jellies use retractable tentacles to capture food.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">PROTOSTOMIA: LOPHOTROCHOZOA</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para59"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Phylum Platyhelminthes: Flatworms are acoelomates with gastrovascular cavities (pp. 652-654,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 33.9</span>-<span class="SmallCap">33.12</span>, TABLE 33.2<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Most flatworms are ribbonlike animals with a gastrovascular cavity. Class Turbellaria is made up of mostly free-living, primarily marine species. Members of the classes Trematoda and Monogenea live as parasites in or on animals. Class Cestoidea (tapeworms), all parasites, lack a digestive tract.</p></LI><LI><a name="para60"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Phylum Rotifera: Rotifers are pseudocoelomates with jaws, crowns of cilia, and complete digestive tracts (p. 654,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.13</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Found mainly in fresh water, many rotifer species are parthenogenetic.</p></LI><LI><a name="para61"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The lophophorate phyla: Bryozoans, phoronids, and brachiopods are coelomates with ciliated tentacles around their mouths (pp. 654-655,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.14</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The lophophore is a horseshoe-shaped, suspension-feeding organ bearing ciliated tentacles.</p></LI><LI><a name="para62"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Phylum Nemertea: Proboscis worms are named for their preycapturing apparatus (p. 655,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.15</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The proboscis worms have a unique retractable tube (proboscis) used for defense and prey capture.

Most members of class Gastropoda, the snails and their relatives, possess a single, spiraled shell; sea slugs lack a shell; embryonic torsion of the body is a distinctive characteristic. Class Bivalvia (clams and their relatives) have hinged shells divided into two halves. Class Cephalopoda includes squids and octopuses, carnivores with beaklike jaws surrounded by tentacles of the modified foot.</p></LI><LI><a name="para64"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Phylum Annelida: Annelids are segmented worms (pp. 659-660,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 33.23</span>, <span class="SmallCap">33.24</span>, TABLE 33.4<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Class Oligochaeta includes earthworms and various aquatic species.

Chelicerates, arthropods with pincer or fanglike feeding appendages, include class Arachnida (spiders, ticks, scorpions, and mites). A traditional classification scheme groups the insects (class Insecta), centipedes (class Chilopoda), and millipedes (class Diplopoda) as uniramians--all with one pair of antennae and unbranched (uniramous) appendages. Crustaceans (lobsters, crayfish, crabs, shrimps, and barnacles) are primarily aquatic arthropods with two pairs of antennae and branched appendages. Research on the origin of segmentation in arthropods and other phyla of segmented animals will help systematists test hypotheses about phylogeny.</p><a name="para67"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in the Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">
