The bodies of nine men found in a captured North Korean submarine will be returned to the North on Friday .
The U.N. Command said Thursday the bodies will be returned in a brief ceremony at the village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea .
The bodies were discovered inside the submarine last week after it was found entangled in a fishing net and seized in South Korean waters .
South Korean officials said the submarine was on an espionage mission and five of its crewmen were shot to death by their commander and three spies , who then killed themselves to avoid capture .
North Korea had earlier questioned the South Korean account , but `` offered no objection '' when presented with evidence at a meeting with U.N. Command generals at Panmunjom on Tuesday .
`` The U.N. Command understood this to mean North Korean acknowledgment of its explanation , '' the command said .
At a follow-up meeting Thursday , the two sides agreed on the return of the bodies .
North Korea will be asked at future meetings to acknowledge the incident , punish those responsible and assure against a recurrence , the U.N. Command said .
The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 .
The countries are still technically at war , since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty .
