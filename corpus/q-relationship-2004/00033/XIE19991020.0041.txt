TOKYO , October 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Shingo Nishimura , parliamentary vice minister of Japan 's Defense Agency , drew fire Tuesday for suggesting that Japan consider arming itself with nuclear weapons .
Nishimura said in an interview with the Weekly Playboy magazine which went on sale Tuesday that Japanese parliament `` should consider the fact that Japan may be better off if it arms itself with nuclear weapons . ''
The comment , which Nishimura called his `` personal opinion , '' provoked criticism from Japan 's main opposition parties such as the Democratic Party of Japan -LRB- DPJ -RRB- , Social Democratic Party -LRB- SDP -RRB- and Japanese Communist Party -LRB- JCP -RRB- .
The three parties issued separate statements accusing Nishimura ` s remarks of running counter to Japan 's policy on nuclear weapons .
Japan has promised not to produce or possess nuclear weapons or to allow them to be brought into the country .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said he will see Nishimura to question him about the meaning of his remarks .
Meanwhile , Defense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara phoned Nishimura , who is in Osaka , and told him that his behavior was `` inappropriate as a parliamentary vice minister , '' Kyodo News quoted Defense Agency officials as saying .
Nishimura , a member of the Liberal Party -LRB- LP -RRB- , sparked controversy in 1997 when he made a trip to China 's Diaoyudao Islands -LRB- known in Japan as Senkaku Islands -RRB- in the East China Sea .
The islands are also claimed by Japan .
Nishimura became one of the defense agency 's two parliamentary vice ministers on October 5 , when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his cabinet to launch a new coalition government between the Liberal Democratic Party -LRB- LDP -RRB- , LP and the New Komeito party .
