Which of these genes are to be expressed? Like unicellular organisms, the cells of multicellular organisms must continually turn certain genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments. In addition, gene expression must be controlled on a long-term basis for <span class="Emphasis2">cellular differentiation,</span> the divergence in form and function as cells become specialized during an organism’s development. Highly specialized cells, such as those of muscle or nervous tissue, express only a tiny fraction of their genes. In fact, a typical human cell expresses only 3-5%  of its genes at any given time. The enzymes that transcribe DNA must locate the right genes at the right time, a task no easier than finding a needle in a haystack. When gene expression goes awry, serious imbalances and diseases, including cancer, can arise. Thus, the question of how eukaryotic genes are regulated is paramount for medical research as well as for basic biology.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Only 35 years ago, an understanding of the mechanisms that control gene expression in eukaryotes seemed almost hopelessly out of reach. Since then, new research methods have empowered molecular biologists to begin to solve these mysteries. Equipped with DNA technology for isolating individual genes and sequencing DNA (discussed in Chapter 20), biologists are now uncovering many of the details of eukaryotic gene regulation.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Despite the extra "nuts and bolts" it requires, the control of gene activity in eukaryotes involves some of the same basic principles as prokaryotic gene regulation. In all organisms, the expression of specific genes is most commonly regulated at the level of transcription by DNA-binding proteins that also interact with other proteins and often with external signals. For that reason, the term <span class="Emphasis1">gene expression</span> is often equated with gene activity--that is, transcription--for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the greater complexity of eukaryotic cell structure and function provides opportunities for controlling gene expression at additional stages.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
