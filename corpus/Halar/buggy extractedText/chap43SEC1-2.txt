HOW SPECIFIC IMMUNITY ARISES

 

 Lymphocytes provide the specificity and diversity of the immune system



 

 Antigens interact with specific lymphocytes, inducing immune responses and immunological memory



 

 Lymphocyte development gives rise to an immune system that distinguishes self from nonself



While microorganisms are under assault by phagocytic cells, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins, they inevitably encounter lymphocytes, the key cells of the immune system--the body's third line of defense. Lymphocytes respond to such contacts by generating efficient and selective immune responses that work throughout the body to eliminate the particular invaders. Keep in mind that the cells of the immune system respond similarly to transplanted cells and even cancer cells, which they detect as foreign.
