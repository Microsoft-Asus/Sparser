MADRID , Spain
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Major oil producers Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Mexico agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through 1999 and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down supplies and improve sagging prices .
Oil and energy ministers from the three nations are searching for ways to bring the price of oil higher .
Crude prices , depressed by overproduction amid a global economic crisis , have hovered this year around 12-year lows , costing oil-producing nations billions of dollars in revenue .
A statement from the oil ministers said Saudi Arabia , Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed their commitment to reductions agreed upon in June 1998 .
Saudi Arabia will produce 725,000 barrels a day ; Mexico will produce 200,000 barrels , and Venezuela will produce 525,000 a day .
Currently , Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , with output at about 8 million barrels per day .
Venezuela produces about 2.8 million barrels a day .
Mexico , which is not an OPEC member , produces 3.2 million barrels a day .
The restrictions are expected to last until December 1999 .
Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Mexico led an initiative to cut production this year which prompted an agreement at the end of June by OPEC , excluding Iraq , and non- OPEC members to cut production by a total of 3.1 million barrels a day for a period of one year starting July 1 .
Analysts and some OPEC members have said another additional 1.5 million barrels must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices .
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to Norway after the Madrid meeting .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Norway has already agreed to cut 100,000 barrels a day until the end of the year</ENAMEX> .
A senior Saudi source , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Saudi Arabia will consult with OPEC colleagues while Mexico and Venezuela will initiate talks with oil producers in their region , such as Colombia and Ecuador .
This week , as a threat of military action against Iraq became real , oil prices changed only slightly .
Thursday , after a brief rise in the morning , prices slipped lower as traders realized that Iraqi oil facilities had n't been damaged .
The price of Brent crude has dipped to around dlrs 10 a barrel in recent weeks .
