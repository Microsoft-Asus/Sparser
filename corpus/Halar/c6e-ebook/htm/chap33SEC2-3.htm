However, the relationship between ctenophores and cnidarians is uncertain. There are only about 100 species of comb jellies, all of which are marine. Ctenophores range in diameter from about 1 to 10 cm. Most are spherical or ovoid, but there are elongate and ribbonlike forms up to 1 m long. <span class="Emphasis1">Ctenophora</span> means "comb-bearer," and these animals are named for their eight rows of comblike plates composed of fused cilia. They are the largest animals to use cilia for locomotion. An aboral sensory organ functions in orientation, and nerves running from the sensory organ to the combs of cilia coordinate movement. Most comb jellies have a pair of long, retractable tentacles (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.8</span>). The tentacles bear adhesive structures called <span class="Emphasis2">colloblasts</span> (also called lasso cells). When prey (mostly small plankton) contact a tentacle, colloblasts burst open. A sticky thread released by each colloblast captures the food, which is then wiped off the tentacle into the mouth.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-8','../fig/big/fig33-8.jpg','fig33-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-8.jpg" alt="fig33-8" name="myfig33-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A ctenophore, or comb jelly.</span> This planktonic marine animal is named for its eight combs of cilia, used for locomotion.
