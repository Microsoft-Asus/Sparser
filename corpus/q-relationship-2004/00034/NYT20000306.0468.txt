MOUNT KUMGANG , North Korea --
A few miles north of the demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula for nearly half a century , the largest corporation from the enemy south has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to install deep-water docks , build a domed theater and a spa with a glass atrium , pave roads and string electric cables .
It has plans for a 1,000-room seaside hotel , a 45-hole golf course and a ski slope .
And it has done all this with the approval of North Korea 's reclusive communist leaders .
Many years could pass for Hyundai Group to even begin to recoup its bet on the future of tourism at the base of Mount Kumgang , where stern-faced soldiers in olive-drab uniforms keep constant vigil and the only practical mode of transportation is by foot .
A gasoline station , built by Hyundai to accommodate tourist vehicles , seems oddly premature .
But the investment by Hyundai , which could reach $ 1 billion or more , is more than just a bet on tourism -- something the North only recently sanctified as part of a gradual thawing of relations .
It is the biggest business risk taken so far on the notion that North and South -- nominally still at war -- will peacefully reunite .
Jang Whan -bin , director of investor relations for Hyundai 's Asan subsidiary , is a positive thinker .
`` We believe the mutual trust that we establish in becoming business partners with North Korea will not only help improve relations between the two countries but also lead to lucrative business opportunities in the long term , '' said Jang , whose company oversees the parent 's operation in the North .
`` When the North and South are eventually integrated , '' Jang added , `` we believe Koreans will remember that Hyundai helped play a role in reunification , and that memory has broad applications for business . ''
Hyundai is now the sole operator of sightseeing tours for South Koreans , who arrive on its cruise ships at the port of Changjon , where the company built docking installations .
The cruise ships , which Hyundai has been operating since November 1998 , depart from South Korean ports .
Hyundai 's effort to develop Mount Kumgang , one of the most spectacular landscapes on the Korean peninsula , has been welcomed by South Korean and Western corporate executives .
Many of them have been trying to figure out for years how to develop commercial relations with the repressive leadership of a country weakened by prolonged isolation and painful food shortages .
`` Hyundai has become a de facto ambassador to North Korea , and everyone is watching with bated breath to see what they can achieve , '' said James Rooney , chief executive of Templeton Investments in Seoul , the South Korean capital .
`` After 50 years of military threats from North Korea , if Hyundai can be a catalyst for peace , help reunite separated families , and put rice on the tables of starving people , South Koreans view that as far more important than investors earning an extra buck a share , '' Rooney said .
Templeton has no investments in Hyundai .
Moreover , many business leaders said economic integration would help stabilize North Korea and enable it to better feed its more than 20 million people , who will one day offer a lucrative market opportunity , just as South Korea did a generation or two ago .
But not everyone agrees that Hyundai is wise to invest so heavily in a country where the risks far outweigh the potential payoff .
`` I admire what Hyundai is doing in North Korea , '' said a Seoul fund manager whose portfolio has substantial Hyundai stock , `` but the bottom line is that these projects are highly risky and offer little hope for significant financial return .
Our money would be better spent on another investment , but so far none of our clients are complaining , because it 's difficult to publicly criticize what Hyundai is trying to do , '' said the fund manager , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the subject is politically sensitive .
Hyundai has been the most aggressive company in pursuing the so-called sunshine policy of South Korea 's president , Kim Dae -jung : actively engaging North Korea as a way of hastening reunification on the peninsula .
Kim lifted restrictions on travel and trade with the North to encourage liberalization there .
The driving force behind Hyundai 's expansion into North Korea has been its billionaire founder , Chung Ju -yung , the son of a poor farmer in Tonchon , in Kangwon province in North Korea .
Chung has made numerous visits to the North and is said to have met with the country 's leader , Kim Jong Il .
In addition to the Mount Kumgang tours , Hyundai has announced plans to build an industrial complex to make consumer products .
After 10 years of on-again , off-again negotiations , North Korea gave Hyundai permission to begin the tours in November 1998 .
Under an agreement , Hyundai estimates that it will pay North Korea a total of $ 942 million in royalties to operate the tours through 2005 , when the deal is to be renegotiated .
The royalty figure is based on a formula under which Hyundai pays North Korea a fee of $ 100 a day for each tourist .
Since 1998 , about 150,000 people have taken the tour .
Hyundai estimates that over the length of the contract , an average of 500,000 people a year will visit the mountain region for at least three days .
In addition to the royalty fees , Hyundai has spent $ 110 million to build tour facilities in North Korea , including the spa , performance theater and docks , and the company plans to spend $ 250 million on future attractions like the hotel , golf course and ski resort .
The agreement with North Korea gives Hyundai exclusive rights to develop tourism in Mount Kumgang for the next 30 years .
Company officials said that if the mountain tours attracted 500,000 visitors a year , Hyundai would cover its operating and royalty costs .
The least expensive tour package is about $ 800 , which includes passage , meals and lodging on a cruise ship and guided hiking tours to the mountain .
The tours were initially restricted to South Koreans .
But the North 's government has agreed to open the tours to non- Koreans .
Hyundai is betting that many will jump at the chance to visit one of the world 's last remaining Stalinist countries .
And Mount Kumgang -- with its stunning peaks , waterfalls , gorges and temples -- is known by many Asians for its beauty .
Japan , which colonized Korea during the first half of the 20th century , is a major target market for the the Mount Kumgang tours .
Hyundai is now negotiating with North Korea to allow the entry of Japanese citizens on ships departing from Japanese ports .
In a recent interview aboard the Hyundai cruise ship Pongnae , Kim Yun -ku , president of Hyundai 's Asan subsidiary , said that an important part of making the venture profitable would be getting tourists to spend money once they arrive in North Korea .
Tourists , mainly from South Korea , now spend $ 12 to visit the spa , $ 25 to see the North Korean circus perform in the theater , and $ 20 to $ 30 on souvenirs .
Aside from climbing , there is little to do in the Mount Kumgang area , and the visitors spend their evenings on the cruise ships .
Kim said that the golf course and other planned attractions would increase the appeal of Mount Kumgang and generate more profit for Hyundai .
He said Hyundai was seeking to attract foreign investment in the project , including retailers and fast-food restaurants that would establish outlets in a major shopping center that the company hopes to build on a wharf .
`` There is so much commercial potential here that Hyundai ca n't possibly do it all alone , '' Kim said .
Suspicion between North and South remains an important underlying risk , and the tours have not been without problems .
Officials in Seoul suspended the tours for several weeks last year , after North Korea detained a South Korean housewife whom it accused of trying to persuade a northern guide to defect .
In addition , Hyundai officials said that negotiating with North Korea is extremely difficult because the country has been isolated for so long that officials there are unaccustomed to modern business practices .
But Hyundai added that the North Koreans are a very quick study , and that the negotiation process had improved .
Some environmentalists are worried that Hyundai 's ambitious plans to develop Mount Kumgang could damage the natural setting , which they say is virtually free of contamination because it has been isolated for so many years .
Southern environmental groups have called for an independent study to determine what effect the development and increasing number of tourists would have on Mount Kumgang , a revered place for many Koreans .
`` In consultation with our business partner , we have taken every step possible to ensure that the Mount Kumgang environment will not be polluted by our tours , '' Jang of Hyundai Asan said .
`` The North Koreans are very serious about protecting this national treasure .
Their rules are so strict that we have to purify the waste water from the spa . ''
