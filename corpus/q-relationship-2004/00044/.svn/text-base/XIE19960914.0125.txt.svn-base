LAGOS , September 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- An option to downgrade the Canadian high commission in Nigeria favored by senior Cadandian officials has become a hot topic among diplomats here , according to press report today .
The option to downgrade the diplomatic mission is not only being favored in retaliation for the closure of Nigerian high commission in Ottawa , capital of Canada .
It is also to protest to the Nigerian government the deterioration of human rights condition in Nigeria and the slow pace of the military 's transition program to civil rule , diplomatic sources said .
Nigeria announced last weekend it was closing down its high commission in Canada as part of its efforts to rationalize existing missions abroad and bring down their personnel to a manageable and cost effect size .
But observers widely believe that the measure was politically motivated , suggesting that the measure was the Nigerian government reprisal at Canada 's virulent pro-democracy campaign against Nigeria .
Canada is the most active in the Commonwealth and has insisted that the organization should impose toucher sanction against Nigeria .
