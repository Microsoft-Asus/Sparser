Plants rooted at the margins of ponds and swamps and organic material that dropped into the water from the terrestrial ecosystems also created new living conditions and new food supplies for fishes living near water’s edge. A diversity of fishes resembling modern lobe-fins and lungfishes had already evolved. Both modern lungfishes and frogs breathe air by a mechanism called buccal pumping rather than using the rib cage, as we do. In buccal breathing, the animal drops the floor of the mouth, which sucks air in, then closes the mouth and raises the floor, forcing air into the lungs. In addition to lungs that supplemented gills for gas exchange at water’s edge, leglike appendages were probably better equipment than fins for paddling and crawling through the dense vegetation in shallow water. Thus, the lungs and appendages of tetrapods evolved in certain specialized fishes tens of millions of years before this equipment was used by the earliest amphibians to live on land.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The fossil record chronicles this transition, over a 50-million-year period from 400 to 350 million years ago, from sturdy-finned fishes such as <span class="Emphasis1">Eusthenopteron</span> to tetrapod fishes to amphibians (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.15</span>). For example, fossils of <span class="Emphasis1">Acanthostega</span> have the bony supports of gills but also have four appendages with the same basic skeletal elements as the walking limbs of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, including humans (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.16</span>). Though <span class="Emphasis1">Acanthostega</span> was aquatic--it was a fish--it represents a period of vertebrate evolution when adaptations that equipped certain fishes for shallow water preadapted one lineage of those fishes for a gradual transition to spending more and more time walking and breathing on the terrestrial side of water’s edge.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-16','../fig/big/fig34-16.jpg','fig34-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-16.jpg" alt="fig34-16" name="myfig34-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Skeleton of <span class="Emphasis1">Acanthostega</span>, a Devonian tetrapod fish.</span> This vertebrate was a fish-- an aquatic vertebrate with gills as an adult-- but its appendages had the tetrapod skeletal structure.

An adaptive radiation gave rise to a great diversity of amphibians during the early Carboniferous period, and in fact, the Carboniferous is sometimes called the "age of amphibians." Amphibians began to decline in numbers and diversity during the late Carboniferous. As the Mesozoic era dawned with the Triassic period, about 245 million years ago, most surviving lineages of amphibians resembled modern species.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
