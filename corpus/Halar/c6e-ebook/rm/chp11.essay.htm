									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">You learned in this chapter that cell-cell signaling is thought to have arisen early in the history of life, because the same mechanisms of signaling are found in distantly related organisms. But why hasn’t some "better" mechanism arisen? Is it too difficult to evolve wholly new signaling mechanisms, or are existing mechanisms simply adequate and therefore maintained? Put another way, need superior signaling mechanisms necessarily evolve if existing mechanisms are adequate and effective? Why or why not?</p>

									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">Cell biologists recently reported the discovery of orexin, a signaling molecule that appears to regulate appetite in humans and other mammals. Orexin concentrations were measurably higher in fasting individuals. Using your knowledge of membrane receptors and signal-transduction pathways, suggest ways in which the understanding of orexin function could lead to treatments for both anorexia and obesity.</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">The aging process is thought to be initiated at the cellular level. Among the changes that can occur after a certain number of cell divisions is the loss of a cell’s ability to respond to growth factors and other chemical signals. Much research into aging is aimed at understanding such losses, with the ultimate goal of significantly extending the human life span. Not everyone, however, agrees that this is a desirable goal. If life expectancy were greatly increased, what might be the social and ecological consequences? How might we cope with these?</p>
