WASHINGTON , September 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Ten people were charged in Miami , Florida , on Monday in what prosecutors said is the largest Cuban spy ring ever uncovered in the United States over the past 40 years .
Reports quoted federal investigators as saying that the eight men and two women tried to penetrate U.S. military bases , infiltrate anti- Castro groups and manipulate U.S. media and political groups .
One of the group 's targets was the Miami -based U.S. Southern Command , which runs American military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean , said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation -LRB- FBI -RRB- .
U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott said , `` This spy ring was cast by the Cuban government to strike at the very heart of our national security system and our very democratic process . ''
Charges against five of the suspects carry life sentences .
Charges against the other five have maximum sentences of 15 years , reports reaching here quoted prosecutors as saying .
Two of those arrested were identified as U.S. citizens and one as a resident alien .
The citizenship of the others was not released , but the FBI said some were agents who slipped in and out of the United States .
According to an FBI affidavit filed in support of the arrests , surveillance dating back to 1995 indicated all 10 members operated with code names and had escape plans and alibis .
The affidavit said that the spy group was led by Manuel Viramontes , a Cuban military captain , and used computers with coded material on disk to communicate with each other .
Viramontes had an apartment in Miami and it was there that the disks were found , investigators said .
The disks provided a detailed overview of spy operations reminiscent of Cold War -era espionage , including references to agents as comrades .
Two of those arrested were identified as U.S. citizens and one as a resident alien .
The citizenship of the others was not released , but the FBI said some were agents who slipped in and out of the United States .
