 Aquaporins affect the rate of water transport across membranes

We have been examining water potential as the force that moves water across the membranes of plant cells, but how do the water molecules actually cross the membranes? Because water molecules are so small, they move relatively freely across the lipid bilayer of membranes, even though the middle zone of that bilayer is hydrophobic (see FIGURE 8.1). Until recently, most biologists accepted the hypothesis that leakage of water across the lipid bilayer was enough to account for water fluxes across membranes. That hypothesis was challenged in the early 1990s, when careful measurements indicated that water transport across biological membranes is too specific and too rapid to be explained entirely by diffusion through the lipid bilayer. This observation suggested the possibility of selective channels for water, and such channels have since been discovered in the membranes of both plant and animal cells.

These specific channels for passive traffic of water are transport proteins called aquaporins. Aquaporins do not affect the water potential gradient or the direction of water flow, but rather the rate at which water diffuses down its water potential gradient. The existence of aquaporins raises the possibility that a cell can regulate the rate of water uptake or loss when it has a water potential different from that of its surroundings. Aquaporins may form gated channels that open and close in response to variables such as turgor pressure of the cell. Many laboratories are now investigating how aquaporins work, and this research is likely to increase our understanding of how the cells of plants and other organisms regulate water balance.
