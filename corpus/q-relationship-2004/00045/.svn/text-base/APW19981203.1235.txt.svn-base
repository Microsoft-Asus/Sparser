Assassins of the Russian mafia escaped to the beaches of Miami after their hits and ran operations in New York , Los Angeles and Houston , a former FBI agent testified Thursday .
Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson , testifying in the trial of reputed mafia boss Sergei Mikhailov , said Mikhailov controlled two of the so-called `` combat brigades , '' as the assassination squads were known .
`` They would commit murders in Russia and other countries in Europe and then come to Miami ... where they would stay by the beach and wait for the heat to cool off , '' Levinson said .
Mikhailov , 40 , is on trial in Switzerland for membership in the Moscow -based Solntsevskaya criminal organization and for breaking Swiss property laws in acquiring a villa near Geneva .
He faces a maximum 7 -LCB- years in prison if convicted .
He has denied any connection to the crime group .
The trial , which began Monday , is expected to hear evidence from more than 90 witnesses .
Levinson , who spent four years investigating the Russian mafia , told the court Thursday that Solntsevskaya took over nightclubs in New York 's Brighton Beach area and in Los Angeles , and invested several hundred thousand dollars in a Houston car dealership .
`` They became a center for drugs and a meeting place for racketeers , '' he said of the New York and Los Angeles clubs .
Levinson also worked on the case of Russian mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov , imprisoned for nearly 10 years in New York last year .
He said Ivankov , Mikhailov and other Solntsevskaya leaders would hold meetings in Miami to discuss `` the takeover and control of several Moscow hotels '' and other criminal operations .
