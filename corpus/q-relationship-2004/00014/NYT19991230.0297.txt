NEW YORK --
Storming a shabby Brooklyn apartment block at dawn on Thursday , an anti-terrorist task force seized a man they charged was an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam , the Algerian caught trying to smuggle powerful explosives and four sophisticated timing devices across the border near Seattle two and a half weeks ago .
The man arrested on Thursday , identified as Abdel Ghani , a 31-year -old Algerian , traveled to Seattle earlier this month to meet with Ressam as part of an elaborate Islamic terrorist bomb plot , torities said .
But the plan was foiled when Ressam , nervous , suddenly bolted off a ferry at the border when a Customs agent looked in the trunk of his car .
Ghani 's arrest came on a day when agents from the FBI fanned out to question , and in some cases detain , Algerian immigrants in several cities .
In Vermont , federal prosecutors linked a Canadian woman arrested while crossing the border with another Algerian man to Ressam .
What the Algerian man and the Canadian woman , Lucia Garafolo , had in common , prosecutors said in successfully arguing she be kept in federal detention , was friendship with Said Atmani , identified in court papers as a member of the Armed Islamic Group , `` a violent Algerian terrorist organization . ''
Federal agents acknowledged privately that they hoped the sweep would serve as a warning or a deterrent to potential terrorists .
In Boston , federal officials arrested five men , one of whom fled from his workplace , prompting a chase with guns drawn , but they were charged only with immigration violations , not anything related to terrorism .
Ghani was charged with helping Ressam 's efforts to bring explosives into the country .
But at a news conference on Thursday night after the charges where announced , Lewis D. Schiliro , assistant director of the FBI in charge of the New York office , said , `` We are aware of no specific and credible threats to any targets in New York City or elsewhere , and that no explosives or explosive devices were found in connection with the arrest and investigation of Abdel Ghani . ''
In interviews , federal law enforcement officials said they had concluded that the Ghani and Ressam were part of a broad plot .
They speculated that because Ressam was caught in mid- December , he could have been contemplating an attack close to New Year 's , but acknowledged that they had no evidence indicating that such an attack had been planned .
Officials said Thursday 's arrest did not mean the ring was broken up .
`` The most interesting thing is there are more , '' one official involved in the investigation said .
`` We know there are more . ''
The question left unanswered was why the Algerian Islamic Group would plan a strike in the United States .
The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Thursday said that based on information from a confidential source , federal agents had concluded that Ghani and another associate believed that `` Allah will shake up this world , that a new generation will punish America , and that Islam 's renaissance will rise from Algeria. '' .
The criminal complaint was based on an affidavit submitted by Bradley S. Morrison , an FBI agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist Task Force of the FBI and the New York Police Department .
In it , Morrison states that because this affidavit was only intended `` for the limited purpose '' of establishing probable cause to arrest .
Ghani , `` it does not include all the facts that have been learned during the course of the investigation . ''
But the complaint did offer a broadbrush image of the plot , although much of it cites a confidential source .
The plan was carefully compartmentalized , according to the criminal complaint , so that in case of an arrest , each person involved would only know the tasks of two others .
Ressam , was to leave the car , with its cargo of bomb-making material and the keys , in a parking lot where someone else would drive it away .
Then he and Ghani were to go to Chicago and other places on a `` fund-raising '' mission , the complaint said .
Ressam is believed to be part of a gangster-terrorist underworld that committed a series of armed robberies and shoot-outs with the police in northern France and later set up a Canadian base in Montreal , according to French anti-terrorism investigators .
The French authorities say the organization grew out of the Armed Islamic Group , part of a bloody insurgency in Algeria and of Arabs who fought on the Muslim side during the war in Bosnia .
