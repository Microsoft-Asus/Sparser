WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Clinton administration eased restrictions on the export of computer technology Thursday , saying regulations have n't kept pace with technological advances .
Officials pledged to review the guidelines every six months .
The new limits maintain tighter control over machines exported for military purposes than for civilian use , while accommodating the capabilities of current processing chips , hard drives and other components .
`` These policies will strengthen America 's high-tech competitiveness , while maintaining controls that are needed to maintain our national security , '' Clinton said .
`` These reforms are needed because of the extraordinarily rapid rate of technological change in the computer industry . ''
Clinton said that , given the power of commercially available personal computers , maintaining standards set in 1996 to stop sensitive technology from falling into unfriendly hands would hurt U.S. businesses without enhancing national security .
Computer industry leaders had sought the changes in a White House meeting earlier this year with Clinton 's chief of staff , John Podesta .
The decision will affect exports to about 100 countries , from the former Soviet bloc to Latin America , but of particular interest to the computer industry is the vast Chinese market , which experts say is growing about twice as fast as the world market for computers .
There is heightened sensitivity to sharing technology with China , given that Beijing is suspected of stealing nuclear secrets from U.S. labs .
But relaxing the guidelines for China did n't seem likely to spark a tempest .
Rep. Christopher Cox , R - Calif. , who led a congressional investigation into the China spying allegations , wrote in a San Jose -LRB- Calif . -RRB-
Mercury News opinion piece last week that such exports have been `` a great democratizing and liberating force . ''
Rep. David Dreier , R - Calif. , said he was encouraged that the administration had acted `` after months of inaction . ''
`` The administration has joined many of us in Congress in recognizing that America 's world-class computer industry faces a looming problem , '' he said .
Industry officials say products that will be widely available next year would have surpassed the current guidelines .
Intel Corp. spokesman Chuck Mulloy called the new rules `` very good progress , '' but said the company saw it only as an `` interim step . ''
Intel plans late next year to release a chip more powerful than those allowed under the revised guidelines .
`` We 're very encouraged about the president 's willingness to work with Congress in a bipartisan look at a long-term solution , '' Mulloy said .
Clinton said he would ask Congress to change rules that require a six-month waiting period between announcement and implementation of regulatory changes for exports .
The administration believes the industry should only have to wait one month .
He also said he would review the limits again in six months .
Under current regulations , exports to what are classified as `` Tier 3 '' countries -- those deemed to present the greatest risk to national security -- are restricted to systems that can perform 7,000 million theoretical operations per second , known as MTOPS , for civilian use and 2,000 million per second for military use .
Now , computer makers will be able to sell systems for civilian use that perform 12,300 MTOPS .
Technology that could have a military application will be limited to 6,500 MTOPS .
The industry had been pushing to raise the limits to 30,000 MTOPS .
`` Our nation 's cutting edge computer industry is constantly recreating itself with technological advances that are the envy of the world , '' Dreier said , adding that he would work with the administration `` to ensure that our export control laws keep pace with technological change . ''
