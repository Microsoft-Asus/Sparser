People offer hormones as an explanation for the howling of alley cats and the moodiness of teenagers. Over a million diabetics in the United States take the hormone insulin, and other hormones are used in cosmetics intended to keep the skin smooth or are added to livestock feed to fatten cattle. The monarch butterfly in the photograph that opens this chapter has just emerged from the silvery cocoon attached to the twig above it. In becoming an adult, the butterfly has undergone a complete change of body form, a metamorphosis regulated by hormones. Internal communication involving those hormones makes it possible for different parts of the insect's body to develop in concert.

An animal hormone (from the Greek hormon, excite) is a chemical signal that is secreted into body fluids, most often into the blood, and communicates regulatory messages within the body. Hormones may reach all parts of the body, but only certain types of cells, the target cells, are equipped to respond. Thus, a given hormone traveling in the bloodstream elicits specific responses--a change in metabolism, for example--from selected target cells, while other cell types ignore that particular hormone.

This chapter's focus is internal chemical signals--what they are and how they function within an animal's body. Our over-arching theme is the role of chemical signals in maintaining homeostasis, a dynamic, steady state in body functions.





AN INTRODUCTION TO REGULATORY SYSTEMS

 

 The endocrine system and the nervous system are structurally, chemically, and functionally related



 

 Invertebrate regulatory systems clearly illustrate endocrine and nervous system interactions



Animals have two systems of internal communication and regulation, the nervous system and the endocrine system. The nervous system, which we will study in Chapters 48 and 49, conveys high-speed signals along specialized cells called neurons. These rapid messages function in such activities as the movement of body parts in response to sudden environmental changes--jerking your hand away from a flame, for example.

Slower means of communication regulate other biological processes, such as the maturation of a butterfly. Different parts of the body must be informed how fast to grow and when to develop the characteristics that distinguish male from female or the juvenile from the adult of a species. This kind of information is often relayed by hormones.

Collectively, all of an animal's hormone-secreting cells constitute the endocrine system. Hormone-secreting organs are called endocrine glands, also called ductless glands because they secrete their chemical messengers directly into body fluids. In contrast, exocrine glands secrete chemicals, such as sweat, mucus, and digestive enzymes, into ducts that convey the products to the appropriate locations.

Although it is convenient to distinguish between the endocrine and nervous systems, the lines between these two regulatory systems are blurred, and homeostasis depends heavily on overlap between them.

Chemical signals play a major role in coordinating the functioning of all animals. Hormones convey information via the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body, while other types of chemical messengers reach their target in other ways. As you learned in Chapter 11, local regulators act between cells that are neighbors (see FIGURE 11.3). Once secreted by the cells that make them, these signal molecules are taken up by nearby target cells, broken down by enzymes in the vicinity, or fixed in place by extracellular matrix, all within seconds or even milliseconds. Consequently, local regulators can affect only local targets. Still other chemical signals, called pheromones, carry messages between different individuals of a species, as in mate attraction. You will learn more about pheromones in Chapter 46, which discusses animal reproduction. Before concentrating on hormones and their modes of action, let's take a brief look at some local regulators and their effects on target cells.

Of the numerous hormones regulating body functions of vertebrates, some affect only one or a few tissues. Others, such as the sex hormones, which promote male and female characteristics, affect most of the tissues of the body. Some hormones, called tropic hormones, have other endocrine glands as their targets and are particularly important to our understanding of chemical coordination. In studying hormonal regulation of the vertebrate body, you may find FIGURE 45.5, showing the locations of the major endocrine glands in the human body, and TABLE 45.1, summarizing the functions of the major vertebrate hormones, especially helpful. In the text, small sketches accompanying each section will help you keep track of each gland's location. We begin our discussion of the vertebrate endocrine system by looking at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which control much of the endocrine system.

Fig 45-5. Human endocrine glands surveyed in this chapter. In addition to the glands shown here, many organs with primarily nonendocrine functions also have cells that secrete hormones. These organs, which are discussed in other chapters, include the heart, the stomach, the small intestines, the kidney, and the placenta of a pregnant woman. Also discussed elsewhere is the thymus gland, an important component of the immune system (Chapter 43). Quite large during childhood, the thymus begins to decline at puberty, when the immune system is well established. By adulthood it is largely replaced by adipose and fibrous tissue, but it continues to function throughout life. It secretes several chemical signals, including thymosin, that stimulate the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes after they leave the thymus. The other endocrine organs in this drawing are discussed in this chapter.

 The endocrine system and the nervous system are structurally, chemically, and functionally related

In this chapter we will see many examples of the close relationship between the endocrine system and the nervous system. Many endocrine organs and tissues contain specialized nerve cells, called neurosecretory cells, that secrete hormones. Animals as distinct as insects and vertebrates have neurosecretory cells in their brain that secrete hormones into the blood. Several chemicals serve both as hormones of the endocrine system and as signals in the nervous system. Epinephrine, for example, functions in the vertebrate body as the so-called "fight or flight" hormone (produced by the adrenal medulla, an endocrine gland) and as a neurotransmitter that conveys messages between neurons in the nervous system.

The regulation of several physiological processes involves structural and functional overlap between the endocrine and nervous systems. Each system affects the output of the other. For instance, the release of milk by a nursing mother is controlled by a series of interdependent nervous and hormonal signals. Suckling stimulates sensory cells in the nipples, and nervous signals to the part of the brain called the hypothalamus trigger the release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland. Oxytocin then causes the mammary glands to secrete milk.

Feedback is another feature common to both the endocrine and nervous systems. The chemical and neural events leading to milk release involve positive feedback. The generation of nerve signals (impulses) also involves positive feedback, as we will see in Chapter 48. Negative feedback regulates many endocrine and nervous mechanisms, especially those involved in maintaining homeostasis. FIGURE 45.1 illustrates one example, and we will see several others in this chapter.

Fig 45-1. An example of how feedback regulation maintains homeostasis. The concentration of calcium ions in the blood is maintained close to a set point by the antagonistic (opposite) actions of two hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Excess blood calcium triggers the secretion of calcitonin, which decreases the calcium level; when calcium gets too low, secretion of PTH causes it to rise.





 Invertebrate regulatory systems clearly illustrate endocrine and nervous system interactions

Invertebrate animals have a variety of hormones that function in homeostasis--by regulating water balance, for instance. However, the hormones that have been most extensively studied function in reproduction and development. In a hydra, for example, one hormone stimulates growth and budding (asexual reproduction) but prevents sexual reproduction. In more complex invertebrates the endocrine and nervous systems are generally integrated in the control of reproduction and development. One well-studied example of nerve and hormone interaction in controlling both reproductive functions and behavior involves the hormone that regulates egg laying in the mollusk Aplysia. Secreted by specialized neurons, this hormone stimulates the laying of thousands of eggs and also inhibits feeding and locomotion, activities that interfere with reproduction.

All groups of arthropods have extensive endocrine systems. Crustaceans, for example, have hormones for growth and reproduction, water balance, movement of pigments in the integument and in the eyes, and the regulation of metabolism. Having exoskeletons that cannot stretch, crustaceans and insects appear to grow in spurts, shedding the old and secreting a new exoskeleton with each molt. Further, most insects acquire their adult characteristics in a single, terminal molt. In insects and crustaceans (and most likely in all arthropods with exoskeletons), molting is triggered by a hormone called ecdysone. In insects, ecdysone is secreted from a pair of endocrine glands, called the prothoracic glands, just behind the head (FIGURE 45.2). Besides stimulating the molt, ecdyone also favors the development of adult characteristics, as in the change from a caterpillar to a butterfly. In insects, ecdysone production is itself controlled by a second hormone, called brain hormone (BH). Produced by neurosecretory cells in the brain, this hormone promotes development by stimulating the prothoracic glands to secrete ecdysone.

Fig 45-2. Hormonal regulation of insect development. Most insects go through a series of larval stages, with each molt (shedding of the old exoskeleton) leading to a larger larva. Molting of the final larval stage gives rise to a pupa, in which metamorphosis produces the adult form of the insect. Hormones control the progression of stages as shown here.

Brain hormone and ecdysone are balanced by juvenile hormone (JH), the third hormone in this system. JH is secreted by a pair of small glands just behind the brain, the corpora allata. Juvenile hormone promotes the retention of larval (juvenile) characteristics. In the presence of a relatively high concentration of juvenile hormone, ecdysone can still stimulate molting, but the product is a larger larva. Only when the level of juvenile hormone wanes can ecdysone-induced molting produce a developmental stage called a pupa. Within the pupa, metamorphosis replaces larval anatomy with the insect's adult form. (Synthetic versions of JH are now being used as insecticides to prevent insects from maturing into reproducing adults.)

In all these invertebrate examples, we see the importance of the nervous system to hormone activity. We will see similar interactions as we survey vertebrate endocrine systems.





 A variety of local regulators affect neighboring target cells

At several points earlier in the book, we have mentioned chemical messengers that affect target cells adjacent to or near their point of secretion. For example, in Chapter 43 we described the roles of interleukins in immunity. In Chapters 11, 12, and 19 we introduced the local regulators called growth factors and their involvement in cancer.

Growth factors are peptides and proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. They must be present in the extracellular environment for many types of cells to grow, divide, and develop normally. Because growth factors are generally named for the first function discovered for them, their names can be misleading, for a given growth factor can have several kinds of target cells and a variety of functions. For instance, nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein that speeds the development of certain embryonic nerve cells, also affects developing white blood cells and several other kinds of cells.

Growth factors have been studied mainly in cell cultures, but many experiments show that growth factors work within the animal body as well as in culture. For instance, injecting epidermal growth factor (EGF) into fetal mice accelerates epidermal development. And a group of peptides known as insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), produced by the liver, is essential to skeletal development. It is likely that the interaction of numerous growth factors regulates cell behavior in developing tissues and organs of animals. Ongoing research also suggests that growth factors (specifically, transforming growth factor, TGF) can enhance the strength of synapses between neurons in the brain of a mature animal.

Another important kind of local regulator is a gas, nitric oxide (NO). Many types of cells produce NO, and it has multiple functions. Highly reactive and potentially toxic, NO usually triggers changes in a target cell within a few seconds of contact and then breaks down. Secreted by neurons, NO functions as a neurotransmitter (see Chapter 48); secreted by white blood cells, it kills certain bacteria and cancer cells in body fluids. And NO released by endothelial cells in blood vessels makes the adjacent smooth muscles relax, dilating the vessel walls. American pharmacologists Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering work on the physiological effects of NO.

The local regulators called prostaglandins (PGs) are modified fatty acids, often derived from lipids to the plasma membrane. They are so named because they were first discovered in the components of semen produced by the human prostate gland. Prostaglandins in semen stimulate contraction of smooth muscles in the wall of the uterus, helping to convey sperm to the egg. Released from most types of cells into the interstitial fluid, prostaglandins function as local regulators affecting nearby cells in various ways. Some of the best-known actions of prostaglandins are on the female reproductive system. For example, prostaglandins secreted by cells of the placenta cause chemical changes in the nearby muscles of the uterus, making them more excitable and thereby helping to induce labor during childbirth. This is an example of a positive feedback mechanism coordinating a body function (see FIGURE 46.19).

Prostaglandins also function as local regulators in vertebrate defense systems. Various prostaglandins help induce fever and inflammation and also intensify the sensation of pain (which can be thought of as contributing to the body's defense by sounding an alarm that something harmful is going on). The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and ibuprofen result from the inhibitory effects of these drugs on prostaglandin synthesis.

Two prostaglandins with very similar molecular structures, prostaglandin E (PGE) and prostaglandin F (PGF), have opposite effects on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels serving the lungs. PGE causes the muscles to relax, which dilates the blood vessels and promotes oxygenation of the blood. PGF signals the muscles to contract, which constricts the vessels and reduces blood flow through the lungs. In other words, these two chemical signals are antagonistic. Shifts in their relative concentrations help maintain homeostasis in changing circumstances, making these local regulators another example of the use of antagonistic signals to counterbalance each other.





 Most chemical signals bind to plasma-membrane proteins, initiating signal-transduction pathways

As we discussed in Chapter 11, a signal molecule has a specific shape that can be recognized by that signal's target cells. Reception of the signal occurs when the signal molecule binds to a specific receptor protein, which is either built into the plasma membrane of the target cell or located inside the target cell (FIGURE 45.3). The binding of a signal molecule to a receptor protein triggers events within the target cell--signal transduction--that result in a response, a change in the cell's behavior. Cells are unresponsive to a signal if they lack the appropriate receptors. How a chemical signal brings about changes in target cells depends on whether it binds to a receptor on the target cell's surface or inside the cell.

Fig 45-3. Mechanisms of chemical signaling: a review. A chemical signal secreted by a cell either (a) binds to a receptor protein on the surface of a target cell, triggering a signal-transduction pathway, or (b) penetrates the target cell's plasma membrane and binds to a receptor inside the cell. When signal is bound to an intracellular receptor, the receptor acts as a transcription factor, causing a change in gene expression. The binding of signal to a surface receptor can lead to either a change in gene expression or a change in a cytoplasmic activity.

Almost all local regulators and a majority of hormones have plasma-membrane receptors (see FIGURE 45.3a). Chapter 11 discussed the discovery that the hormone epinephrine exerts its effects via membrane receptors. Another dramatic example of the role of membrane receptors involves changes in frog skin color, an adaptation that helps camouflage the frog as lighting changes. The darkness of the skin varies with the organelle arrangement within melanocytes, skin cells that contain the dark brown pigment melanin in cytoplasmic organelles called melanosomes. The frog's skin appears light when the melanosomes are clustered tightly around the cell nuclei and darker when the melanosomes spread throughout the cytoplasm. The arrangement of melanosomes is controlled by a peptide hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), secreted by the pituitary gland. When MSH is added to the interstitial fluid surrounding the pigment-containing cells, the melanosomes disperse. However, direct microinjection of MSH into individual melanocytes does not induce melanosome dispersion--evidence that interaction between the hormone and a surface receptor is required for hormone action.

A signal receptor located in the plasma membrane is generally the first component of a signal-transduction pathway, a series of molecular changes that converts an extracellular chemical signal to a specific intracellular response. You may wish to review the molecules and mechanisms of cell signaling in Chapter 11. Depending on the signal molecule and the molecules present in a target cell, a signal-transduction pathway may lead to responses in either the cytoplasm (the activation of an enzyme, for instance) or the nucleus (usually involving the regulation of specific genes). And because different types of cells have different collections of molecules (especially proteins), the same signal can bring about different responses in different target cells (FIGURE 45.4). Hormones are especially potent regulators, effective in minute amounts, and signal-transduction pathways can trigger elaborate enzyme cascades that amplify the hormonal signal (see FIGURE 11.16).

Fig 45-4. One chemical signal, different effects. A single type of signal molecule, in this case a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, can produce different responses in different target cells. Different responses may result because the receptors are different [compare (a) with (b) and (c)] or because signal-transduction pathways within the target cells are different (see also FIGURE 11.18).





 Steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and some local regulators enter target cells and bind to intracellular receptors

The first indication that some hormones do enter their target cells came from the study of the vertebrate hormones estrogen and progesterone. In most mammals, including humans, these steroid hormones are necessary for the normal development and function of the female reproductive system. In the early 1960s, researchers demonstrated that cells in the reproductive tract of female rats accumulate estrogen. The hormone was found within the nuclei of these cells, but not in the cells of such tissues as the spleen, which do not respond to estrogen. Progesterone also enters the nuclei of target cells. Such observations led to the hypothesis that cells sensitive to a steroid hormone contain internal receptor molecules that bind specifically to that hormone. We now know that intracellular proteins are the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, the hormonal form of vitamin D, and some local regulators, such as NO--all small nonpolar molecules that pass easily through cell membranes. Most intracellular receptors are located in the nucleus (see FIGURE 45.3b); others are in the cytoplasm, at least initially (see FIGURE 11.10).

Intracellular receptor proteins usually perform the entire task of transducing the signal within the cell. The chemical signal activates the receptor, which then directly triggers the cell's response. In almost all cases, the intracellular receptor activated by a hormone is a transcription factor, and the response is a change in gene expression. The active form of the factor--the hormone-receptor complex--binds to specific sites in the cell's DNA and either stimulates or represses the transcription of specific genes (see FIGURES 17.7 and 19.9). Newly made mRNA is then translated into new protein in the cytoplasm.

The arthropod molting hormone ecdysone (see FIGURE 45.2) is an example of a steroid that brings about the synthesis of new proteins. Ecdysone causes certain cells of an arthropod to synthesize the enzymes that catalyze the production of a new exoskeleton. In another example, estrogen induces cells in the reproductive system of a female bird to synthesize large amounts of ovalbumin, the main protein of egg white.

As with hormones that bind to cell-surface receptors, hormones that bind to intracellular receptors may have different effects on different target cells within an animal. For example, the estrogen that stimulates a bird's reproductive system to make ovalbumin causes its liver to make other proteins. And from that example you can see that the same hormone may have different effects in different species--human females do not respond to estrogen by making ovalbumin! Another example of a species difference in hormone response involves thyroxine, a thyroid hormone. In human and other vertebrates, thyroxine is responsible for metabolic regulation. But in frogs, thyroxine also triggers the metamorphosis of a tadpole into an adult, stimulating resorption of the tadpole's tail and other changes.





 The hypothalamus and pituitary integrate many functions of the vertebrate endocrine system

The hypothalamus plays an important role in integrating the vertebrate endocrine and nervous systems. This region of the lower brain receives information from nerves throughout the body and from other parts of the brain, then initiates endocrine signals appropriate to environmental conditions. In many vertebrates, for example, the brain passes sensory information about seasonal changes and the availability of a mate to the hypothalamus by means of nerve signals; the hypothalamus then triggers the release of reproductive hormones required for breeding.

The hormone-releasing cells in the hypothalamus are two sets of neurosecretory cells whose secretions are stored in or regulate the activity of the pituitary gland, a small organ with multiple endocrine functions. The pituitary gland was formerly called the "master gland" because so many of its hormones regulate other endocrine functions. However, the pituitary itself obeys hormonal orders from the hypothalamus.

No organ illustrates the close structural, functional, and developmental relationships of the endocrine and nervous systems better than the pituitary gland. Located at the base of the hypothalamus, it has two discrete parts that develop from two separate regions of the embryo and have very different functions (FIGURE 45.6). The anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, develops from a fold of tissue at the roof of the embryonic mouth that grows upward toward the brain and eventually loses its connection to the mouth. The anterior pituitary consists of endocrine cells that synthesize and secrete several hormones directly into the blood. A set of neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus exerts control over the anterior pituitary by secreting two kinds of hormones into the blood. Releasing hormones make the anterior pituitary secrete its hormones. Inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus make the anterior pituitary stop secreting hormone.

Fig 45-6. Hormones of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain and surrounded by bone, consists of the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) and the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis). Note that the posterior pituitary is actually an extension of the hypothalamus.

The hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are released into capillaries in a region at the base of the hypothalamus (FIGURE 45.6b). The capillaries drain into portal vessels, which are short blood vessels that subdivide into a second capillary bed within the anterior pituitary. In this way, the hypothalamic hormones have direct access to the gland they control. Every anterior pituitary hormone is controlled by at least one releasing hormone, and some have both a releasing hormone and an inhibiting hormone.

Unlike the anterior pituitary, the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis, is an extension of the brain. It develops from a small bulge of the hypothalamus that grows downward toward the mouth fold that forms the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary remains an extension of the hypothalamus. It stores and secretes two hormones that are made by a set of neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus.

Posterior Pituitary Hormones

The two hormones released by the posterior pituitary, oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), are made by the hypothalamus. Oxytocin acts on muscles of the uterus and ADH acts on the kidneys, rather than affecting other endocrine glands. Oxytocin induces contraction of the uterine muscles during childbirth and causes the mammary glands to eject milk during nursing. ADH acts on the kidneys, increasing water retention and thus decreasing urine volume.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is part of an elaborate feedback scheme that helps regulate the osmolarity of the blood. This mechanism was introduced in Chapter 44, but it is worth reviewing here to illustrate how hormones contribute to homeostasis and how negative feedback controls hormone levels. Blood osmolarity is monitored by a group of nerve cells that function as osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. When the osmolarity of the plasma increases, these cells shrink slightly (due to osmosis) and transmit nerve impulses to certain neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. These cells respond by releasing ADH from their tips, which are located in the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary stores ADH and releases it into the general circulation. When ADH reaches the kidneys, it binds to receptors on the surface of the cells lining the collecting ducts. This binding activates a signal-transduction pathway that increases the water permeability of the collecting duct. Water exits the collecting ducts and enters nearby capillaries, helping prevent a further increase in blood osmolarity above the set point. The brain's osmoreceptors also stimulate a thirst drive, and drinking water brings blood osmolarity back down to the set point. Thus, the hormonal reaction to high blood osmolarity is augmented by a behavioral response controlled by the nervous system. As the more dilute blood arrives at the brain, the hypothalamus responds to the reduction in osmolarity by slowing the release of ADH and diminishing the sensation of thirst. The effects of these hormonal and behavioral responses--increased water reabsorption in the kidneys and drinking, respectively--prevent overcompensation by shutting off further secretion of the hormone and quenching thirst. We see once again how negative feedback helps maintain homeostasis. This example also highlights the central role of the hypothalamus as a member of both the endocrine system and the nervous system.

Anterior Pituitary Hormones

The anterior pituitary produces many different hormones. Four of these are tropic hormones that stimulate the synthesis and release of hormones from other endocrine glands. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates the release of thyroid hormones; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) controls the adrenal cortex; and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) govern reproduction by acting on the gonads. Other hormones produced by the anterior pituitary are growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the endorphins.

Growth hormone (GH), a protein of about 200 amino acids, affects a wide variety of target tissues and has both direct effects and tropic effects. GH promotes growth directly and stimulates the production of growth factors. For example, the ability of GH to stimulate the growth of bones and cartilage is partly due to the hormone's signaling the liver to produce insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), which circulate in blood plasma and directly stimulate bone and cartilage growth. (This endocrine response to growth hormone qualifies GH as a tropic hormone. And IGF secretion by the liver qualifies that organ as an endocrine gland, among its many other functions.) In the absence of GH, skeletal growth of an immature animal will stop. If GH is injected into an animal that has been deprived of its own GH, growth will be partially restored.

Several human growth disorders are related to abnormal GH production. Excessive production of GH during development can lead to gigantism, while excessive GH production during adulthood results in the abnormal growth of bones in the hands, feet, and head, a condition known as acromegaly. Deficient GH production in childhood can lead to pituitary dwarfism. Children with GH deficiency have been treated successfully with human growth hormones isolated from cadaver pituitaries. However, the supply falls short of demand, and growth hormones from most other animals are ineffective. One of the most dramatic achievements of genetic engineering has been the production of GH by bacteria with genes for human GH spliced into their genomes (see Chapter 20). The product is now being used to treat children with hypopituitary dwarfism. Some athletes take GH (legally or illegally) to build muscles.

Prolactin (PRL) is a protein so similar to GH that it is believed that their genes that evolved from the same ancestral gene. The physiological roles of these two hormones, however, are different. Prolactin's most remarkable characteristic is the great diversity of effects it produces in different vertebrate species. For example, PRL stimulates mammary gland growth and milk synthesis in mammals; regulates fat metabolism and reproduction in birds; delays metamorphosis in amphibians, where it may also function as a larval growth hormone; and regulates salt and water balance in freshwater fishes. This list suggests that prolactin is an ancient hormone whose functions have diversified during the evolution of the various vertebrate classes.

Three of the tropic hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary are closely related chemically. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are all similar glycoproteins, protein molecules with carbohydrate attached to them. FSH and LH are also called gonadotropins because they stimulate the activities of the male and female gonads, the testes and ovaries. TSH stimulates the production of hormones by the thyroid gland.

The remaining hormones from the anterior pituitary are all made from a single parent molecule called pro-opiomelanocortin. This is a large protein that is cleaved into several short fragments inside anterior pituitary cells. At least three of these fragments are active peptide hormones. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the production and secretion of steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex. As described earlier, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) regulates the activity of pigment-containing cells in the skin of some vertebrates. MSH secreted by the mammalian pituitary seems to play a key role in fat metabolism, probably by a feedback mechanism that targets neurons in the hypothalamus. The other derivatives of pro-opiomelanocortin are a class of hormones called endorphins. These molecules are also produced by certain neurons in the brain. They are sometimes called the body's natural opiates because they inhibit the perception of pain. In fact, heroin and other opiate drugs mimic endorphins and bind to the same receptors in the brain. Some researchers speculate that the so-called runner's high results partly from the release of endorphins when stress and pain in the body reach critical levels. (Endorphins are discussed further in Chapter 48.)





 The pineal gland is involved in biorhythms

The pineal gland is a small mass of tissue near the center of the mammalian brain (closer to the brain surface in some other vertebrates). Although we know considerably more about the pineal than we did when Descartes described it as the seat of the soul, there is much more to learn. The pineal secretes the hormone melatonin, a modified amino acid. Depending on the species, the pineal contains light-sensitive cells or has nervous connections from the eyes, and melatonin regulates functions related to light and to seasons marked by changes in day length. For example, melatonin, like melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), affects skin pigmentation in many vertebrates. Most of the pineal's functions, though, are related to biological rhythms associated with reproduction. Melatonin is secreted at night, and the amount secreted depends on the length of the night. In winter, for example, the days are short and the nights are long, so more melatonin is secreted. Thus, melatonin production is a link between a biological clock and daily or seasonal activities, such as reproduction. Recent evidence suggests that the main target cells of melatonin are in the part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as a biological clock. Melatonin seems to decrease the activity of neurons in the SCN, and this may be related to its role in mediating rhythms. However, much remains to be learned about the precise role of melatonin and about biological clocks in general.





 Thyroid hormones function in development, bioenergetics, and homeostasis

In humans and other mammals, the thyroid gland consists of two lobes located on the ventral surface of the trachea (see FIGURE 42.22a). In many other vertebrates the two halves of the gland are separated on the two sides of the pharynx. The thyroid gland produces two very similar hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine: triiodothyronine (T3), which contains three iodine atoms, and tetraiodothyronine, or thyroxine (T4), which contains four iodine atoms (FIGURE 45.7). In mammals, the thyroid secretes mainly T4, but target cells convert most of it to T3. T3 has greater affinity for the hormone receptor, which is located in the cell nucleus. Thus it is mostly T3 that brings about responses in target cells. The secretion of thyroid hormones is controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary in a complex negative feedback system (FIGURE 45.8).

Fig 45-7. Two thyroid hormones. Structurally identical, except that T3 has three iodine atoms and T4 has four, these hormones regulate metabolism in most body cells. The thyroid secretes mainly T4, most of which is converted to T3 by an enzyme in target cells. T3 binds more avidly than T4 to receptors in the target cells.

Fig 45-8. Feedback control loops regulating the secretion of thyroid hormones T3 and T4. The hypothalamus secretes TRH (TSH-releasing hormone), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). When TSH binds to specific receptors in the thyroid gland, a signal-transduction pathway involving cAMP as a second messenger triggers the synthesis and release of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. The system is balanced by negative feedback loops. In the two main ones (red arrows), high levels of T3, T4, and TSH in the blood inhibit TRH secretion by the hypothalamus.

The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in vertebrate development and maturation. A striking example is the thyroid's control of metamorphosis of a tadpole into a frog, which involves massive reorganization of many different tissues. The thyroid is equally important in human development. An inherited condition of thyroid deficiency known as cretinism results in markedly retarded skeletal growth and poor mental development. These defects can often be overcome, at least partially, if treatment with thyroid hormones is begun early in life. Studies with nonhuman animals have shown that thyroid hormones are required for the normal functioning of bone-forming cells and for the branching of nerve cells during embryonic development of the brain.

The thyroid gland also plays a vital role in homeostasis. In adult mammals, for instance, thyroid hormones help maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone, digestion, and reproductive functions. Throughout the body, T3 and T4 are important in bioenergetics, generally increasing the rate of oxygen consumption and cellular metabolism. Too much or too little of these hormones in the blood can result in serious metabolic disorders. For example, in humans, an excessive secretion of thyroid hormones, known as hyperthyroidism, produces such symptoms as high body temperature, profuse sweating, weight loss, irritability, and high blood pressure. The opposite condition, hypothyroidism, can cause cretinism in infants and produce symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, and intolerance to cold in adults.

Another condition associated with a shortage of thyroid hormones is an enlargement of the thyroid called goiter, often caused by a deficiency of iodine in the diet. The feedback system shown in FIGURE 45.8 explains why iodine deficiencies lead to goiter. In the absence of sufficient iodine, the thyroid gland cannot synthesize adequate amounts of T3 and T4. Consequently, the pituitary continues to secrete TSH, leading to an enlargement of the thyroid.

In addition to having cells that secrete T3 and T4, the mammalian thyroid gland contains endocrine cells that secrete calcitonin. This hormone lowers calcium (Ca2+) levels in the blood as part of calcium homeostasis, described in the next section.





 Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin balance blood calcium

The four parathyroid glands, embedded in the surface of the thyroid, function in the homeostasis of calcium ions. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which raises blood levels of Ca2+ and thus has an effect opposite to that of the thyroid hormone calcitonin. A lack of PTH causes blood levels of calcium to drop dramatically, leading to convulsive contractions of the skeletal muscles. If unchecked, this condition, known as tetany, is fatal. Calcium ions, in appropriate concentration, are essential to the normal functioning of all cells.

PTH raises the level of blood Ca2+ by direct and indirect effects on bone and kidney. In bone, PTH induces specialized cells called osteoclasts to decompose the mineralized matrix of bone and release Ca2+ to the blood. In the kidneys, PTH has two effects: It stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ through the renal tubules, and it activates the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. An inactive form of vitamin D, a steroid-derived molecule, is obtained from food or synthesized in the skin and then activated sequentially in the liver and the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D functions as a hormone. It acts in concert with PTH in bone, and it also affects the intestines, where it stimulates the uptake of Ca2+ from food. For hormonal action, vitamin D binds to receptors in the nuclei of target cells and regulates gene transcription.

When blood calcium rises above a certain level, calcitonin comes into play. It has effects on bone and kidneys opposite to those of PTH and thus decreases blood Ca2+. The control of blood calcium level is an example of how homeostasis is often maintained by the balancing of two antagonistic hormones--in this case, PTH and calcitonin. In classic feedback fashion, these two hormones balance each other's effects, thereby minimizing fluctuations in the concentration of calcium in the blood (FIGURE 45.9).

Fig 45-9. Hormonal control of calcium homeostasis in mammals. A negative feedback system involving two antagonistic hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH), maintains the concentration of calcium in blood very close to 10 mg/100mL. A rise in blood Ca2+ induces the thyroid gland to secrete calcitonin, which lowers the Ca2+ concentration by increasing bone deposition and reducing reabsorption in the kidneys. (By interfering with PTH, the calcitonin also helps reduce Ca2+ uptake by the intestines, not shown.) These effects are reversed by PTH, which is secreted from the parathyroid glands when the concentration of blood Ca2+ falls below the set point. Blood calcium levels begin to increase as target cells in the bones and kidneys respond to PTH. In addition to stimulating Ca2+ uptake in these organs directly, PTH also acts indirectly by helping activate vitamin D in the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D then stimulates the intestines to increase Ca2+ uptake from food. But blood Ca2+ will rise only so far before the thyroid counters by secreting more calcitonin.





 Endocrine tissues of the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon, antagonistic hormones that regulate blood glucose

The pancreas is one of many organs that perform both endocrine and exocrine functions. Endocrine cells make up only 1-2%  of the weight of the pancreas. The rest of the organ is exocrine tissue that produces bicarbonate ions and digestive enzymes that are carried to the small intestine via the pancreatic duct (see FIGURE 41.16). Scattered among this exocrine tissue are the islets of Langerhans, clusters of endocrine cells that secrete two major hormones directly into the circulatory system. Each islet has a population of alpha cells, which secrete the peptide hormone glucagon, and a population of beta cells, which secrete the hormone insulin.

Insulin and glucagon are antagonistic hormones that regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. This is a critical bioenergetic and homeostatic function, because glucose is a major fuel for cellular respiration and a key source of carbon skeletons for the synthesis of other organic compounds. Metabolic balance depends on the maintenance of blood glucose at a concentration near a set point, which is about 90 mg/100 mL in humans. When blood glucose exceeds this level, insulin is released and acts to lower the glucose concentration. When blood glucose drops below the set point, glucagon increases glucose concentration. By negative feedback, blood glucose concentration determines the relative amounts of insulin and glucagon secreted by the islet cells (FIGURE 45.10, p. 968).

Fig 45-10. Glucose homeostasis maintained by insulin and glucagon. A rise in blood glucose above the set point (about 90 mg/100 mL in humans) stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin, which triggers its target cells to take up the excess glucose from the blood. Once the excess is removed and blood glucose concentration dips below the set point, the pancreas responds by secreting glucagon, which acts on the liver to raise the blood glucose level.

Insulin and glucagon both influence blood glucose concentration by multiple mechanisms. Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating virtually all body cells except those of the brain to take up glucose from the blood. (Brain cells are unusual in being able to take up glucose without insulin; as a result, the brain has access to circulating fuel molecules almost all the time.) Insulin also decreases blood glucose by slowing glycogen breakdown in the liver and inhibiting the conversion of amino acids and glycerol (from fats) to sugar.

The liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissues store large amounts of fuel molecules and are especially important in bioenergetics. The liver and muscles store sugar as glycogen, whereas adipose tissue cells convert sugars to fats. The liver is a key fuel-processing center because only liver cells are sensitive to glucagon. Normally, glucagon starts having an effect before blood glucose levels even drop below the set point. In fact, as soon as excess glucose is cleared from the blood, glucagon signals the liver cells to increase glycogen hydrolysis, convert amino acids and glycerol to glucose, and start slowly releasing glucose back into the circulation.

The antagonistic effects of glucagon and insulin are vital to glucose homeostasis, a mechanism that precisely manages both fuel storage and fuel use by body cells. We will revisit the topic of fuel management and see that it involves additional hormones when we study the adrenal glands in the next section. The liver's ability to perform its vital roles in glucose homeostasis results from the metabolic versatility of its cells and its access to absorbed nutrients via the hepatic portal vessel, which carries blood directly from the small intestine to the liver.

When the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis go awry, there are serious consequences. Diabetes mellitus, perhaps the best-known endocrine disorder, is caused by a deficiency of insulin or a loss of response to insulin in target tissues. The result is high blood glucose--so high, in fact, that the diabetic's kidneys excrete glucose, which explains why the presence of sugar in urine is one test for diabetes. As more glucose concentrates in the urine, more water is excreted with it, resulting in excessive volumes of urine and persistent thirst. (Diabetes, from the Greek, refers to this copious urination, and mellitus is from the Greek word for "honey," referring to the presence of sugar in the urine.) Because glucose is unavailable to most body cells as a major fuel source for diabetics, fat must serve as the main substrate for cellular respiration. In severe cases of diabetes, acidic metabolites formed during fat breakdown accumulate in the blood, threatening life by lowering blood pH.

There are actually two major forms of diabetes with very different causes. Type I diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent diabetes) is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system mounts an attack on the cells of the pancreas. (Chapter 43 discusses possible causes of autoimmune reactions.) This disorder usually occurs rather suddenly during childhood, destroying the person's ability to produce insulin. Treatment consists of insulin injections, which are usually taken several times daily. Until recently, insulin for injections was extracted from animal pancreases, but genetic engineering has provided a relatively inexpensive source of human insulin by inserting DNA encoding the hormone into bacteria (see FIGURE 20.1). Type II diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) is characterized either by a deficiency of insulin or, more commonly, by reduced responsiveness in target cells due to some change in insulin receptors. Type II diabetes usually occurs after about age 40, becoming more likely with increasing age. More than 90%  of diabetics are type II, and many can manage their blood glucose solely by exercise and dietary control, although helpful drugs are now available. Both heredity and obesity are major factors in type II diabetes.





 The adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex help the body manage stress

The adrenal glands are adjacent to the kidneys. In mammals, each adrenal gland is actually made up of two glands with different cell types, functions, and embryonic origins: the adrenal cortex, or outer portion, and the adrenal medulla, or central part. Nonmammalian vertebrates have quite different arrangements of the same tissues.

The adrenal medulla has close developmental and functional ties with the nervous system. Secretory cells of the adrenal medulla are derived from cells of the neural crest (see FIGURE 34.6). Some of the neural crest cells in the abdominal region of a vertebrate embryo may differentiate into either endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla or neurons, depending on chemical signals in the vicinity (FIGURE 45.11).

Fig 45-11. Derivation of endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla and neurons from neural crest cells. Studies of neural crest cells in laboratory cultures indicate that the fate of these cells in embryonic vertebrates depends on chemical signals. Embryonic chicken neural crest cells that have migrated to the region of the body where the adrenal glands develop may differentiate into hormone-secreting cells of the adrenal medulla if they are given glucocorticoids (hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex). If the same neural crest cells are exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF), they develop into nerve cells called sympathetic neurons (you'll learn about the function of these neurons in Chapter 48).

What makes your heart beat faster and your skin develop goose bumps when you sense danger or approach a stressful situation, like speaking in public? These reactions are part of the fight-or-flight response stimulated by two hormones of the adrenal medulla, epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These hormones are members of a class of compounds, the catecholamines, that are synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine (FIGURE 45.12).

Fig 45-12. The synthesis of catecholamine hormones. Cells in the adrenal medulla synthesize the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine from the amino acid tyrosine.

Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and other catecholamines are secreted in response to positive or negative stress--everything from extreme pleasure to increased cold to life-threatening danger. Their release into the blood gives the body a rapid bioenergetic boost, increasing the basal metabolic rate and having dramatic effects on several targets. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase the rate of glycogen breakdown in the liver and skeletal muscles and glucose release into the blood by liver cells. They also stimulate the release of fatty acids from fat cells. The fatty acids may be used by cells for energy. In addition to increasing the availability of energy sources, epinephrine and norepinephrine have profound effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. For example, they increase both the rate and the stroke volume of the heartbeat and dilate the bronchioles in the lungs, effects that increase the rate of oxygen delivery to body cells. (This is why doctors prescribe epinephrine as a heart stimulant and to open breathing tubes during asthma attacks.) The catecholamines also cause smooth muscles of some blood vessels to contract and muscles of other vessels to relax, with an overall effect of shunting blood away from the skin, digestive organs, and kidneys while increasing the blood supply to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles.

What causes the release of catecholamines during the response to stress? The adrenal medulla is under the control of nerve cells from the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (discussed in Chapter 48). When nerve cells are excited by some form of stressful stimulus, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the adrenal medulla. Acetylcholine combines with receptors on the cells, stimulating the release of epinephrine. Norepinephrine is released independently of epinephrine. Its functions are similar to those of epinephrine, but its primary role is in sustaining blood pressure, while epinephrine generally has a stronger effect on heart and metabolic rates. Norepinephrine also functions as an important neurotransmitter in the nervous system, as we will see in Chapter 48.

The adrenal cortex, like the adrenal medulla, reacts to stress. But it responds to endocrine signals rather than to nervous input. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to secrete a releasing hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary to release the tropic hormone ACTH. When it reaches its target via the bloodstream, ACTH stimulates cells of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete a family of steroids called corticosteroids. In another case of negative feedback, elevated levels of corticosteroids in the blood suppress the secretion of ACTH.

Many corticosteroids have been isolated from the adrenal cortex. The two main types in humans are the glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, and the mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone (FIGURE 45.13).

Fig 45-13. Steroid hormones from the adrenal cortex and gonads. (a) Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) and aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid), both made in the adrenal cortex, are structurally similar to (b) the sex hormones testosterone (an androgen), estradiol (an estrogen), and progesterone (a progestin). The precursor for the synthesis of all steroid hormones is cholesterol (see FIGURE 5.14). Most of the androgens (male hormones) that circulate in the blood are made by the testes, and most of the estrogens and progestins (female hormones) are produced by the ovaries; however, small amounts of these sex hormones are also made by the adrenal cortex.

The primary effect of glucocorticoids is on bioenergetics, specifically on glucose metabolism. Augmenting the fuel-mobilizing effects of glucagon from the pancreas, glucocorticoids promote the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources, such as proteins, making more glucose available as fuel. Glucocorticoids act on skeletal muscle, causing a breakdown of muscle proteins. The resulting carbon skeletons are transported to the liver and kidney, where they are converted to glucose and released into the blood. The synthesis of glucose from muscle proteins is a homeostatic mechanism providing circulating fuel when body activities require more than the liver can mobilize from its glycogen stores. It can also be part of a broader role of the glucocorticoids, that of helping the body withstand long-term environmental challenge.

Abnormally high doses of glucocorticoids administered as medication suppress certain components of the body's immune system--for example, the inflammatory reaction that occurs at the site of an infection. Glucocorticoids are used to treat diseases in which excessive inflammation is a problem. Cortisone, for instance, was once thought to be a miracle drug that could cure serious inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. It has become clear, however, that long-term use of corticosteroids can result in increased susceptibility to infection and disease because of the immunosuppressive effects of these powerful drugs.

Mineralocorticoids have their major effects on salt and water balance. Aldosterone, for example, stimulates cells in the kidney to reabsorb sodium ions and water from the filtrate, raising blood pressure and volume. Aldosterone (of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS), ADH from the posterior pituitary, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from the heart form a regulatory complex with multiple feedback loops that underlie the kidney's ability to maintain the ion and water homeostasis of the blood (see FIGURE 44.21). Aldosterone secretion is largely regulated by the RAAS itself in response to changes in plasma ion concentration. However, when an individual is under severe stress, the hypothalamus tends to secrete more releasing hormones that increase the rate of secretion of ACTH by the anterior pituitary. The rise in ACTH in the blood then increases the rate of secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex.

Evidence is mounting that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids help maintain homeostasis when the body experiences stress over an extended period of time. FIGURE 45.14 compares the long-term stress-induced actions of corticosteroids with the short-term ones of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Fig 45-14. Stress and the adrenal gland. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to activate the adrenal medulla via nerve impulses and the adrenal cortex via hormonal signals. The adrenal medulla mediates short-term responses to stress by secreting the catecholamine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. The adrenal cortex controls more prolonged responses by secreting steroid hormones.

A third group of corticosteroids are sex hormones, mainly androgens (male hormones) similar to testosterone produced by the testes and small amounts of estrogens and progesterone (female hormones). There is evidence that adrenal androgens account for the sex drive in adult females, but otherwise the physiological roles of the adrenal sex hormones are not well understood. We will discuss the sex hormones from the gonads in the next section.





 Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior

The gonads produce and secrete three major categories of steroid hormones: androgens, estrogens, and progestins (see FIGURE 45.13). All three types are found in both males and females but in different proportions. Produced in the testes of males and ovaries of females, these steroids affect growth and development and also regulate reproductive cycles and sexual behavior.

The testes primarily synthesize androgens, the main such hormone being testosterone. In general, androgens stimulate the development and maintenance of the male reproductive system. Androgens produced early in the development of an embryo determine that the fetus will develop as a male rather than a female. At puberty, high concentrations of androgens are responsible for the development of human male secondary sex characteristics, such as male patterns of hair growth and a low voice.

Estrogens, the most important of which is estradiol, have a parallel role in the maintenance of the female reproductive system and the development of female secondary sex characteristics. In mammals, progestins, which include progesterone, are primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus, which supports the growth and development of an embryo.

The synthesis of both estrogens and androgens is controlled by gonadotropins, FSH and LH, from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH and LH secretion is controlled by one releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). We will examine the complex feedback relationships that regulate the secretion of gonadal steroids in detail in Chapter 46. There we will see that the endocrine system is central not only to the survival of the individual but also to the propagation of the species.
