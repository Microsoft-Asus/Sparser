PYONGYANG , January 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">condemned today the United States for spreading the rumor of `` threat from North Korea '' and conducting military exercises jointly with South Korea</ENAMEX> off the west coast of Korea .
The official DPRK paper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that Washington 's allegation of `` threat from North Korea '' and `` threat from China '' is nothing but a trick to help realize its ambition of exercising hegemony in Asia .
It is precisely under the pretext of forestalling such `` threats '' that <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">the United States has conducted various war games with Japan and South Korea</ENAMEX> and is now trying to increase its military presence in South Korea , the paper said .
The United States has never changed its ambition of world hegemony and East Asia is its first target , the commentary said .
The United States should understand that its dream of an exclusive military control over Asia will never come true and that only genuine peace and relaxation of tension in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity are in its own interests .
In another strongly-worded commentary , the newspaper slammed the <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">U.S. joint mock warfare with South Korea</ENAMEX> as being `` aimed at invading the DPRK . ''
According to a Korean Central News Agency -LRB- KCNA -RRB- report , involved in the 10-day-long military exercise begun on Saturday are `` two submarines and nine surface ships such as destroyers belonging to the U.S. Seventh Fleet as well as four anti-submarine patrol planes . ''
The report added another large-scale joint naval exercise is scheduled for February 13 .
These activities of the United States are `` aggravating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula extremely , '' the commentary said .
The commentary said U.S. hard-liners are still trying to isolate and stifle socialism in the DPRK although the two countries reached a framework nuclear agreement in 1994 .
