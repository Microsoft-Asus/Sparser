Concerning the Kosovo crisis , Sun reiterated that the parties concerned should solve the issue peacefully by continuing negotiations in an appropriate and just manner .
`` The relevant parties should exercise restraint and adopt a patient and flexible attitude in solving the problem '' , he said .
He noted that the issue should be resolved politically through dialogues on the basis of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo region .
Sun also cited the report that China has attained two undesignated cruise missiles from Afghanistan as `` baseless and sheer fabrication . ''
He also denied the charges that China has stolen nuclear technology from the United States .
Sun continued to blame a United States ' bill to establish National Missile Defense -LRB- NMD -RRB- system for `` not only influencing directly the nuclear disarmament process , but also exerting extensive and far-reaching negative influence over the global strategic balance and stability of the coming century . ''
`` China is seriously concerned about it '' , he said , referring to the bill which got through in the US Congress recently .
Despite possessing the world 's largest and most advanced nuclear and conventional weapon storage , the US now still fully devotes itself to developing national and theater missile defense systems , said Sun .
The US moves run counter to the trend of seeking peace and promoting development , and infringe upon relevant treaties on nuclear arms control and disarmament , he pointed out .
As to Sino - Vatican ties , Sun reiterated that China is willing to `` develop normal and friendly ties '' with the Vatican .
Meanwhile , he clearly added two conditions to developing ties with the Vatican that the Vatican must sever its so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan , and that the Vatican cannot use the issue of religion to interfere in China 's internal affairs .
