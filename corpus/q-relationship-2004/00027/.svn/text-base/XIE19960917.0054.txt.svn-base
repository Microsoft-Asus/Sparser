GENEVA , September 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Swiss government has announced a plan to slaughter up to a quarter of the country 's cattle herd in a bid to eliminate the threat of `` mad cow '' disease in the country , local press reported on Tuesday .
Up to 230,000 of the one million cattle in Switzerland will be slaughtered if the plan is approved by parliament in its autumn session .
The government said in a statement on Monday that it was proposing the slaughter of cattle born before December 1 , 1990 , the year when Switzerland introduced a ban on feeding cows with beef bone and other remains that could help spread the disease BSE .
The offspring of infected cows are also targeted .
The government said the move was designed to minimize potential risks and restore consumer confidence in the beef market which has been hit by a beef health scare in Britain .
But Swiss farmers associations strongly protested the plan , saying it was meaningless and would worsen the suffering endured by farmers since `` mad cow '' disease hit the headlines in March .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Switzerland trails only Britain in the number of reported cases of mad cow disease</ENAMEX> , which is formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- .
The cumulative total reported in September was 223 cases .
Sales of beef in Europe have plummeted after the British government admitted in March that there was a possibility that the deadly BSE could be transferred to humans who eat infected beef .
