WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- President Clinton urged states Thursday to issue photo ID licenses for handgun purchases , much like licenses for driving or hunting .
The proposal was the last from Clinton 's State of the Union agenda that was not revealed in advance of Thursday 's speech .
The White House said it would go beyond the gun legislation Clinton proposed last year , which is stalled in committee .
`` Every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license .
I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases , '' Clinton said .
`` I hope you 'll help me pass that in this Congress . ''
The National Rifle Association dismissed the licensing proposal as unworkable .
`` What 's it going to solve ?
The criminals could care less , '' said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre .
`` They 're not going to stand in line ; they wo n't comply with it . ''
Under Clinton 's plan , anyone who wants to buy a handgun would be required to first obtain a license showing he has passed a background check and a gun safety requirement , such as a training course or an exam .
States could choose not to participate in the program , according to a White House official who discussed the proposal on condition of anonymity .
In states that decline to set up the licensing system , a federally approved gun dealer or a federal entity would issue the license , the official said .
`` We are not mandating this , '' the official said .
Tighter gun control already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign .
In fact , Clinton 's licensing plan is very similar to one already offered by Vice President Al Gore .
Gore 's program calls for making gun license mandatory , and requiring manufacturers and federally licensed sellers to report gun sales to state authority .
Further , Gore would ban so-called Saturday night specials and expand background checks and mandate child-safety locks .
Former Sen. Bill Bradley , Gore 's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , has urged mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and gun registration .
He also would raise license fees on dealers and ban Saturday night specials .
On the Republican side , Texas Gov. George W. Bush has called for raising the age for handgun purchases to 21 .
He also supports instant background checks at gun shows .
Bush opposes universal gun registration .
Steve Forbes says he would let states set firearm standards .
The proposal unveiled by Clinton was part of an overall strategy seeking to tighten gun regulations and increase gun safety .
The president previously revealed he would seek $ 280 million in the fiscal 2001 budget for hiring more firearms agents and prosecutors at federal , state and local levels , tracing guns used in crimes , increasing funding for ballistics tests .
