For example, an animal will have muscle cells that enable it to move and nerve cells that transmit signals to the muscle cells; a plant will have mesophyll cells that carry out photosynthesis and stomatal cells that regulate the passage of gases into and out of leaves (see<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.2</span>). As you know, cells are only one level in the hierarchy of biological order within a multicellular organism (see<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.1</span>). Cells of similar types are organized into tissues, tissues into organs, organs into organ systems, and organ systems into the whole organism. Thus, the process of embryonic development must give rise not only to cells of different types but to higher-level structures arranged in a particular way in three dimensions.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
