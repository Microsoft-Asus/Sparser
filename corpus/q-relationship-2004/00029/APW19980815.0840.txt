<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">While Kenyans grieved at dozens of funerals for victims of the embassy bombing , hundreds of investigators worked through the weekend pursuing leads in a probe that has expanded to Pakistan</ENAMEX> .
Two days after saying the investigation was progressing , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">the head of the intensive FBI -led effort again expressed confidence it was on the right track toward learning the terrorists ' identities</ENAMEX> .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">We 're proceeding with numerous leads , '' Sheila Horan , special FBI agent in charge , said Saturday at the bombed U.S. embassy site</ENAMEX> , while specialists studied evidence in striped tents nearby .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Many individuals are coming to us .
We are identifying many individuals in the community that we wish to speak with , '' she said .</ENAMEX>
A potentially crucial new development has emerged that may be unrelated to their efforts , however .
In Washington , officials said U<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">.S. investigators were heading to Pakistan to join the investigation of a man who is reported to have confessed to planning the bombings</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The CIA made arrangements late Friday for agents to question the man , who was arrested or detained by Pakistani authorities</ENAMEX> , according to a U.S. law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity Saturday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The suspect , identified as 32-year -old Mohammed Sadique , was detained as he tried to slip out of Pakistan into Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , the Pakistan newspaper The News reported Sunday .
