CARE , the Atlanta -based relief and development agency , said Tuesday that it has evacuated its international staff members from southern Guinea after an attack in the area killed an unknown number of people , including a United Nations employee .
CARE 's four international staffers were evacuated overland to Conakry , the capital of the west African nation -- a 12-hour drive -- in a convoy along with international employees of other nongovernmental agencies in the area , Nick Webber , CARE director for Guinea and Sierra Leone , said in a telephone conversation from Guinea .
`` They 're all out .
They 're all well .
They 're all safe , '' Webber said .
But he said some of CARE 's Guinean staff members feared they had lost family members in the fighting .
Nonetheless , Guinean staff members are keeping the CARE office open in Gueckedou , the southern city from which the agency runs a large relief operation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In the Gueckedou region , CARE has been distributing food to more than 200,000 Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees for more than two years</ENAMEX> .
Overall , Guinea hosts more than 460,000 refugees , one of the largest refugee populations in Africa .
About 330,000 are from Sierra Leone and 126,000 from Liberia .
The pullout of staff by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , CARE and other nongovernmental organizations leaves those refugees temporarily in the lurch .
`` Hopefully , in a few days , we will be able to resume operations , '' Webber said .
The motive for Sunday 's attack in Macenta , a town near Gueckedou , is not known for certain , but Webber said there is no reason to think humanitarian workers were targeted .
`` It was extremely nasty that humanitarian workers have been caught up in a problem they are unrelated to , '' he said .
