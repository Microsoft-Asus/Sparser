The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday , Feb. 3 : The crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 is the latest in a stream of ocean crashes -- the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996 , the Swissair crash off the Canadian coast in 1998 , the EgyptAir plane crash off the Massachusetts coast last year and , just this past Sunday , the Kenya Airways disaster near the Ivory Coast .
Flight 261 dropped into the sea near Los Angeles shortly after the pilots reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer , the device on the tail that helps control the plane 's pitch .
The stabilizers on the MD -80 series of planes _the kind of aircraft used on Flight 261 -- were the subject of a Federal Aviation Administration directive last May calling for inspections of possible corrosion , though whether that is relevant to this accident is not known .
Federal investigators have begun interviewing witnesses , reviewing radar records and searching for the flight recorders that now lie in waters 700 feet deep .
The aircraft involved has a solid safety record .
Alaska Airlines also has a good safety record , with only two other fatal accidents in its history , though it has been under a federal investigation for improper maintenance practices involving two planes .
The recent high-profile crashes do not change the fact that commercial aviation remains an exceptionally safe means of transportation .
But public anxiety is perhaps unavoidable because the mechanics of flight remain to many people a bit of a mystery .
The mystery only deepens when something causes a plane to fail .
