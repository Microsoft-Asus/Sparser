LAGOS , May 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees in southwest Guinea may soon be cut off from food supply unless a relief effort is stepped up , the U.N. World Food Program -LRB- WFP -RRB- has warned</ENAMEX> .
In a statement issued from Liberian capital Monrovia Friday , the WFP said 200,000 Sierra Leoneans had sought refuge in Guinea since early March and over 42,000 were in remote areas likely to be made impassable by the rainy season over the next six weeks .
`` If we are not able to move food during the next two to three weeks , thousands of refugees will go hungry in July , '' said WFP Regional Manager Paul Areas in the statement .
The WFP in a joint appeal with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- called for at least 30 four-wheel drive trucks to transfer refugees to better camps and to ensure the continued delivery of relief supplies to refugee sites .
The two agencies are currently relying on 14 trucks operated by the German GTZ Development Organization .
The refugees have fled continued insecurity in parts of Sierra Leone , where rebels close to the military junta ousted in February are still active .
In a statement at the opening of the parliament session Friday , restored President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah deplored the atrocities being committed by the rebels troops against civilians , including the amputation of ears and limbs .
He said that the rebels , `` not wanting Sierra Leone to exist as a nation , '' were destroying the country 's resources , including mines , infrastructure and government buildings .
