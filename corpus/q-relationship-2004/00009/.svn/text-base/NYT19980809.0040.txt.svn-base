Some American companies see Iran , one of five countries that border the landlocked Caspian Sea , not only as a place for exploration but also as an economic route for transporting energy to Western markets .
But the administration has put considerable diplomatic effort into promoting countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- as new sources of energy that bypass both Russia and Iran .
Increasingly , oil companies that have already started extracting oil and gas from the Caspian are questioning the wisdom of an administration-backed plan that would put oil in a lengthy and expensive pipeline from Baku to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey .
The administration likes this idea because it anchors Turkey , a NATO ally , in the quest for oil and avoids Iran .
Expressing the growing disquiet about the proposed pipeline , an American oil executive here said , `` We do n't want to be stuck with a white elephant . ''
As an indication of the complexities of the questions , the administration has appointed a coordinator for Caspian Sea issues .
He is Richard Morningstar , who has been director of American aid in the countries of the former Soviet Union .
Mobil and Conoco have led the effort to persuade the administration to be more flexible .
Conoco has proposed that American companies be permitted to invest the same amount as foreign companies -- $ 20 million each annually .
In May , Mobil sponsored advertisements in two newspapers asking that U.S. companies be permitted to `` swap '' oil with Iran -- deliver Caspian crude for use in Iran 's northern cities , then pick up an equivalent volume at the country 's southern port of Kharg Island .
The advertisements also suggested that the companies be allowed to negotiate deals with Iran , with the understanding that these would remain unconsummated until sanctions are lifted -- a precedent established in Vietnam before the trade embargo there was abolished in 1994 .
Finally , the advertisements asked for the repeal of a ban on the use of Iranian equipment on the Caspian , a move that would free American companies to participate with partners who use Iranian -supplied equipment .
Industry leaders have been watching the progress of an application for the swap waiver that Mobil made to the Treasury Department in April , perceiving it as a bellwether of administration policy .
Eizenstat , the under secretary , said the application had not yet been considered at the highest levels .
But he said swaps were not a `` simple solution '' to the Caspian 's transportation problems , and asserted that they `` could create a dangerous dependency on Iran . ''
Even if the United States appears unlikely to budge much , oil industry analysts said the pressure will continue to build .
They cited a recent trip to Tehran by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi , followed by a delegation of top European Union leaders .
Industry analysts expect more European leaders to visit .
Both British Petroleum and Shell operate offices in Tehran .
Recently BP also sent crude oil samples from Azerbaijan to Iran .
Conoco officials said they were not entirely pessimistic .
They noted that , in her overture to Iran , secretary Albright spoke of the need for a `` road map '' to the development of relations between the United States and Iran , the same language that Conoco 's Dunham employed in his earlier appeal to Clinton .
