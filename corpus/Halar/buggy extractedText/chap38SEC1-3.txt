 Neolithic humans created new plant varieties by artificial selection



 

 Biotechnology is transforming agriculture



 

 Plant biotechnology has incited much public debate



Plant biotechnology has two meanings. In the general sense, it refers to innovations in the use of plants, or of substances obtained from plants, to make products of use to humans--an endeavor that began in prehistory. Used in a more specific sense, biotechnology refers to the use of genetically modified (GM) organisms in agriculture and industry. Indeed, in the last two decades, genetic engineering has become such a powerful--some would say too powerful--force in biotechnology that the terms genetic engineering and biotechnology have become synonymous in the media. In this last section, we examine the question of how humans have altered plants to suit their purposes from the birth of agriculture to the present.
