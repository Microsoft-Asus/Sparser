Curbing money-laundering and reducing narcotics demand will be among the main themes of a U.N. drug conference which opens next week , the U.N. 's chief drug control officer said Thursday .
President Clinton will open the three-day `` Special Session on the World Drug Problem '' with a speech Monday to the U.N. General Assembly .
Representatives of about 150 governments , including 35 heads of state or government , are also expected to attend .
They include French President Jacques Chirac , Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo , Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera , Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori , Bolivian President Hugo Banzer and President Ernesto Samper of Colombia .
`` For the first time , we have the issue of demand reduction included at the same level as other components of narcotics control , '' Pino Arlacchi , head of the U.N. drug control office , said .
Arlacchi said demand reduction includes measures to rehabilitate addicts , discourage young people from taking drugs and `` a strategy for an elimination or substantial reduction '' in the cultivation of cannabis , poppies and other narcotic crops over 10 years by offering alternative crops to farmers .
He said the European Community should expand its programs for drug rehabilitation and developing countries should establish treatment programs .
`` We think that the time has come to include some important elements of the money-laundering issue , '' he added .
`` We are concerned about bank secrecy as an impediment to criminal investigations worldwide and about the proliferation of tax havens worldwide ... that provide secure havens and protection '' for drug profits .
Other issues on the agenda include control of legal chemicals which can be synthesized into narcotics and cooperation among law enforcement and courts worldwide .
The goal will be to encourage individual national governments to enact legislation in line with conference guidelines .
But critics have questioned whether the United Nations is capable of mounting an effective program and whether the conference will endorse an American -style `` war on drugs , '' which has failed to achieve success .
In a statement Thursday , the Catholic Institute for International Relations warned that a strategy which emphasizes `` repressive anti-drugs policies '' and ignores the needs of poor farmers is bound to fail .
Arlacchi said he had no intention of mounting a U.S. -style `` drug war '' on a global scale .
`` There is a kind of ` U.S. -centric ' vision of what is happening in the world that should be overcome , '' Arlacchi said .
`` I think this is a wrong metaphor for every place . ''
The United Nations estimates that two countries -- Myanmar and Afghanistan -- account for 80 percent of the world 's illicit poppy production .
The Islamic Taliban , which controls most of Afghanistan , has agreed to let the United Nations begin monitoring poppy cultivation in an attempt to discourage opium production .
Despite aggressive efforts to interdict drug shipments , the United Nations estimates that law enforcement agencies would be able to seize no more than 10 percent of heroin shipments and 30 percent of cocaine traffic worldwide .
