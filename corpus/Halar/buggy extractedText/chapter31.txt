The words fungus and mold may evoke some unpleasant images. Fungi rot timbers, attack living plants, spoil food, and afflict humans with athlete's foot and worse maladies. However, ecosystems would be in trouble without fungi to decompose dead organisms, fallen leaves, feces, and other organic materials, thus recycling vital chemical elements back to the environment in forms other organisms can assimilate. Most plants depend on mutualistic fungi that help their roots absorb minerals and water from the soil. In addition to these ecological roles, fungi have been used by humans in various ways for centuries. We eat some fungi (mushrooms, for instance), culture fungi to produce antibiotics and other drugs, add them to dough to make bread rise, and use them to ferment beer and wine. Many fungi are also quite colorful and beautiful, as you can see from Mary Elizabeth Banning's 19th-century watercolor of indigo milk cap (Lactarius indigo). Whatever our initial subjective perceptions may be, fungi are fascinating as objects of study. They are a form of life so distinctive that they have been accorded their own taxonomic kingdom.

In this chapter we will characterize the members of the kingdom Fungi, survey their diversity, discuss their ecological and commercial impact, and consider hypotheses about their evolutionary origin. As we did with the plant kingdom, we will look in some detail at life cycles, mainly for what they tell us about the phylogeny and evolutionary adaptations of fungi.

 Many fungi have a heterokaryotic stage



Fungi are eukaryotes, and most are multicellular. Although fungi were once grouped with plants, they are unique organisms that generally differ from other eukaryotes in nutritional mode, structural organization, growth, and reproduction. In fact, molecular studies indicate that animals, not plants, are the closest relatives of fungi (see FIGURE 28.8).

Fig 31-4. Phylogeny of fungi. This phylogenetic tree, supported primarily by molecular evidence, indicates probable evolutionary relationships among the four phyla of the kingdom Fungi. Representing the oldest lineage of fungi, the chytrids are mainly aquatic and have flagellated cells. Fungi in the other three phyla lack flagellated stages.

 Absorptive nutrition enables fungi to live as decomposers and symbionts

Fungi are heterotrophs that acquire their nutrients by absorption. In this mode of nutrition, small organic molecules are absorbed from the surrounding medium. A fungus digests food outside its body by secreting powerful hydrolytic enzymes into the food. These exoenzymes, as they are called, decompose complex molecules to the simpler compounds that the fungus can absorb and use.

The absorptive mode of nutrition is associated with the ecological roles of fungi as decomposers (saprobes), parasites, or mutualistic symbionts. Saprobic fungi absorb nutrients from nonliving organic material, such as fallen logs, animal corpses, or the wastes of live organisms. In the process of this saprobic nutrition, fungi decompose the organic material. Parasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells of living hosts. Some of these fungi, such as certain species infecting the lungs of humans, are pathogenic. Pathogenic fungi cause about 80%  of plant diseases. Mutualistic fungi also absorb nutrients from a host organism, but they reciprocate with functions beneficial to their partners in some way, such as aiding a plant in the uptake of minerals from the soil.





 Extensive surface area and rapid growth adapt fungi for absorptive nutrition

The vegetative (nutritionally active) bodies of most fungi are usually hidden, being diffusely organized around and within the tissues of their food sources. Except for yeasts, which are unicellular, the bodies of fungi are constructed of tiny filaments called hyphae (singular, hypha). Hyphae are composed of tubular walls surrounding plasma membranes and cytoplasm. The hyphae form an interwoven mat called a mycelium (plural, mycelia), the "feeding" network of a fungus (FIGURE 31.1).

Fig 31-1. Fungal mycelia.

Fungal mycelia can be huge, although they usually escape our notice--because they are subterranean, for instance. In 2000, scientists discovered the mycelium of one giant individual of the fungus Armillaria ostoyae in Oregon that is 3.4 miles in diameter and spreads through 2,200 acres of forest, equivalent to over 1,600 football fields. This fungus is at least 2,400 years old and hundreds of tons in weight, qualifying it as one of Earth's oldest and largest organisms.

Most fungi are multicellular with hyphae divided into cells by cross-walls, or septa (singular, septum). The septa generally have pores large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria, and even nuclei to flow from cell to cell (FIGURE 31.2a, p. 618). The cell walls of fungi differ from the cellulose walls of plants. Most fungi build their cell walls mainly of chitin, a strong but flexible nitrogen-containing polysaccharide identical to the chitin found in the external skeletons of insects and other arthropods. Some fungi are aseptate; that is, their hyphae are not divided into cells by cross-walls. Known as coenocytic fungi, they consist of a continuous cytoplasmic mass with hundreds or thousands of nuclei (FIGURE 31.2b). The coenocytic condition results from the repeated division of nuclei without cytoplasmic division. Parasitic fungi usually have some of their hyphae modified as haustoria, nutrient-absorbing hyphal tips that penetrate the tissues of the host (FIGURE 31.2c). There are even fungi with hyphae adapted for preying on animals (FIGURE 31.2d).

Fig 31-2. Examples of fungal hyphae.

The correlation between structure and function is a fundamental theme of biology. The filamentous structure of the mycelium provides an extensive surface area that suits the absorptive nutrition of fungi. Ten cubic centimeters of rich organic soil may contain as much as 1 km of hyphae having a fungal surface area of over 300 cm2 interfacing with the soil.

A fungal mycelium grows rapidly, adding as much as a kilometer of hyphae each day as it branches throughout a food source. Such fast growth is possible because proteins and other materials synthesized by the entire mycelium are channeled by cytoplasmic streaming to the tips of the extending hyphae. The fungus concentrates its energy and resources on adding hyphal length and thus overall absorptive surface area, rather than girth. Fungal mycelia are nonmotile; they cannot run, swim, or fly in search of food or mates. But the mycelium makes up for the lack of mobility by swiftly extending the tips of its hyphae into new territory.





 Fungi disperse and reproduce by releasing spores that are produced sexually or asexually

Fungi reproduce by releasing spores that are produced either sexually or asexually. The output of spores is enormous. For example, puffballs, which are reproductive structures of certain fungi, can puff out clouds containing trillions of spores (see FIGURE 22.8). Carried by wind or water, spores germinate to produce mycelia if they land in a moist place where there is food. Spores thus function in dispersal and account for the wide geographic distribution of many species of fungi. The airborne spores of fungi have even been found more than 160km (100 miles) above Earth. Closer to home, try leaving a slice of bread out for a week or two and you will observe the furry mycelia that grow from the invisible spores raining down from the surrounding air.





 Many fungi have a heterokaryotic stage





The nuclei of fungal hyphae and spores of most species are haploid, except for transient diploid stages that form during sexual life cycles. However, some mycelia may become genetically heterogeneous through the fusion of two hyphae that have genetically different nuclei. Such a mycelium is said to be a heterokaryon, meaning "different nuclei." In some cases, the different nuclei stay in separate parts of the same mycelium, which is then a mosaic in terms of genotype and phenotype. In other cases, the different nuclei mingle and may even exchange chromosomes and genes in a process similar to crossing over. This heterokaryon condition has some of the advantages of diploidy; one haploid genome may be able to compensate for harmful mutations in the other nucleus, and vice versa.

In many fungi with sexual life cycles, the union of partners occurs in two distinct stages called plasmogamy and karyogamy (FIGURE 31.3). First comes plasmogamy, the fusion of the two parents' cytoplasm when their mycelia come together. The second stage, karyogamy, is the fusion of the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents. Plasmogamy and karyogamy may be separated in time by hours, days, or even years or centuries. During the interim, the hybrid mycelium exists as a heterokaryon, its haploid nuclei still separate. In some fungi, the haploid nuclei pair off, two to a cell, one from each parent. Such a mycelium, a special case of a heterokaryon, is said to be dikaryotic, meaning "two nuclei." Without fusing, the two nuclei in each cell divide in tandem as the mycelium grows, until karyogamy finally occurs. In most fungi, the zygotes or transient structures formed by karyogamy are the only diploid stages in the life cycle. Meiosis restores the haploid condition before specialized reproductive structures of the mycelium produce and disperse spores. Of course, the sexual processes of karyogamy and meiosis have generated genetic variation, upon which adaptive evolution depends (see Chapters 13 and 23 to review sex as a mechanism that increases genetic diversity within a population).

 Phylum Chytridiomycota: Chytrids may provide clues about fungal origins

The chytrids are mainly aquatic. Some are saprobes; others parasitize protists, plants, and animals. Parasitic chytrids may be contributing to a worldwide decline in the number of amphibians.

Until recently, some systematists emphasized the absence of flagellated cells as a membership requirement for the kingdom Fungi. By that criterion, chytrids were excluded and placed instead in the kingdom Protista (of the five-kingdom system) because they form uniflagellated spores called zoospores (FIGURE 31.5, p. 620). However, in the past decade, molecular systematists comparing the sequences of proteins and nucleic acids uncovered strong support for including the chytrids with the fungi as a monophyletic branch of the eukaryotic tree (see FIGURE 31.4). Other key fungal characteristics of chytrids are an absorptive mode of nutrition and cell walls made of chitin. Most chytrids form coenocytic hyphae, although some are unicellular. Chytrids also have some key enzymes and metabolic pathways that are common among fungi but are not found in the so-called funguslike protists (slime molds and water molds; see Chapter 28).

Molecular evidence also supports the hypothesis that chytrids are the most primitive fungi, meaning that they belong to the lineage that diverged earliest in the phylogeny of fungi. A reasonable extension of this hypothesis is that fungi evolved from protists that had flagella, a feature retained in the fungal kingdom only by the chytrids.





 Phylum Zygomycota: Zygote fungi form resistant structures during sexual reproduction





Mycologists have described about 600 zygomycetes, or zygote fungi. (The suffix -mycete, which occurs many times in this chapter, means "fungus.") These fungi are mostly terrestrial and live in soil or on decaying plant and animal material. One group of major importance forms mycorrhizae, mutualistic associations with the roots of plants (see FIGURE 31.18). Zygomycete hyphae are coenocytic, with septa found only where reproductive cells are formed.

Fig 31-18. Mycorrhizae. Mutualistic associations between fungi and roots, mycorrhizae enhance the absorption of minerals. This scanning electron micrograph of fungal hyphae on a small root of a eucalyptus reveals the intimate association between the symbiotic partners of mycorrhizae. Some mycorrhizal fungi surround the living cells of the root, while others actually penetrate the root cells.

A common zygomycete is black bread mold, Rhizopus stolonifer, still an occasional household pest despite the addition of preservatives to most processed foods (FIGURE 31.6). Horizontal hyphae spread out over the food, penetrate it, and absorb nutrients. In the asexual phase, bulbous black sporangia develop at the tips of upright hyphae. Within each sporangium, hundreds of haploid spores develop and are dispersed through the air. Spores that happen to land on moist food germinate, growing into new mycelia. If environmental conditions deteriorate--for instance, if all the food is used up--this species of Rhizopus reproduces sexually. The parents in a sexual union are mycelia of opposite mating types, identical in appearance but different in the chemical markers that mates recognize. Plasmogamy produces a resistant structure called a zygosporangium, in which karyogamy and then meiosis occur (FIGURE 31.7). Note that a zygosporangium, while representing the zygote (2n) stage in the life cycle, is not a zygote in the usual sense of a cell with one diploid nucleus. Rather, the zygosporangium is a multinucleate structure, first heterokaryotic with many nuclei from the two parents, then with many diploid nuclei after karyogamy.

		Neighboring mycelia of opposite mating types (designated + and -)

		The gametangia undergo plasmogamy (fusion of cytoplasm), forming a heterokaryotic zygosporangium containing multiple haploid nuclei from the two parents. 
			  
		This cell develops a rough, thick-walled coating (upper right LM) that can resist dry conditions and other harsh environments for months. 
			  
		When conditions are favorable again, karyogamy occurs. Paired nuclei fuse, followed by meiosis. 
			  
		The zygosporangium then breaks dormancy, germinating into a short sporangium that 
			  
		disperses genetically diverse, haploid spores. 
			  
		These spores germinate and grow into new mycelia. 
			  
		Mycelia of Rhizopus can also reproduce asexually by forming sporangia (lower left LM) that produce genetically identical haploid spores.

The zygosporangia, for which zygomycetes are named, are resistant to freezing and drying and are metabolically inactive. When conditions improve, the zygosporangia release genetically diverse haploid spores that colonize the new substrate. Some zygomycetes, such as Pilobolus, can actually aim their spores (FIGURE 31.8).

The fungus then shoots its sporangia like cannonballs; they can land and stick to grass as far as 2 m away. Grazing animals such as cows scatter the spores in feces.





 Phylum Ascomycota: Sac fungi produce sexual spores in saclike asci





Mycologists have described over 60,000 species of ascomycetes, or sac fungi, from a variety of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. They range in size and complexity from unicellular yeasts to minute leaf-spot fungi to elaborate cup fungi and morels (FIGURE 31.9). Ascomycetes include some of the most devastating plant pathogens, which will be discussed later in the chapter. However, many are important saprobes, particularly of plant material. About half the ascomycete species live with algae in the mutualistic associations called lichens. Some ascomycetes form mycorrhizae with plants. Others live between mesophyll cells in leaves, apparently helping to protect the plant tissues from insects by releasing toxic compounds.

Fig 31-9. Ascomycetes (sac fungi). The "fruiting" (sexual) structures of ascomycetes are called ascocarps.

The defining feature of the Ascomycota is the production of sexual spores in saclike asci (singular, ascus). Unlike the zygote fungi, most sac fungi bear their sexual stages in macroscopic fruiting bodies, or ascocarps. The spore-forming asci are found in the ascocarps.

Ascomycetes reproduce asexually by producing enormous numbers of asexual spores, which are often dispersed by wind. The asexual spores are produced externally at the tips of specialized hyphae called conidiophores, often in long chains or clusters. These spores are not formed inside sporangia, as in the Zygomycota. Such naked spores are called conidia, from the Greek for "dust."

Compared to zygomycetes, ascomycetes are characterized by a more extensive heterokaryotic stage, which is associated with the formation of ascocarps (FIGURE 31.10). Plasmogamy between specialized regions of two parental hyphae produces a heterokaryotic bulge called the ascogonium. The coenocytic ascogonium extends hyphae partitioned by septa into dikaryotic cells, each with two haploid nuclei representing the two parental mycelia. It is the cells at the tips of these dikaryotic hyphae that develop into asci. Within an ascus, karyogamy combines the two parental genomes, and then meiosis forms four genetically varied ascospores. One mitotic division doubles the ascospore number to eight. In many asci, the eight ascospores are lined up in a row in the order in which they formed from a single zygotic nucleus. This arrangement provides geneticists with a unique opportunity to study genetic recombination. Genetic differences between mycelia grown from ascospores taken from one ascus reflect crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.

		 Haploid mycelia of opposite mating types become intertwined and form an ascogonium and an antheridium. 
			  
		A cytoplasmic bridge forms, allowing plasmogamy (cytoplasmic fusion) to occur. The ascogonium acts as a "female," receiving haploid nuclei from the "male" antheridium. The ascogonium then has a pool of nuclei from both parents, but karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) does not occur at this time. 
			  
		 The ascogonium gives rise to dikaryotic hyphae that are incorporated into an ascocarp, the cup of a cup fungus (see FIGURE 31.9a). 
			  
		The tips of the ascocarp's dikaryotic hyphae are partitioned into asci (singular, ascus). 
			  
		Karyogamy occurs within these asci, and the diploid nucleus divides by meiosis, 
			  
		yielding four haploid nuclei. 
			  
		Each of these haploid nuclei divides once by mitosis, and the ascus now contains eight nuclei. Cell walls develop around these nuclei to form ascospores. (The LM shows a mature ascus with eight ascospores.) 
			  
		When mature, all ascospores in an ascus are dispersed at once out the end of the ascus. A collapsing ascus jars neighboring asci and causes them to release their spores. The chain reaction releases a visible cloud of spores with an audible hiss. 
			  
		Germinating ascospores give rise to new haploid mycelia. 
			  
		Ascomycetes can also reproduce asexually by producing airborne spores called conidia.





 Phylum Basidiomycota: Club fungi have long-lived dikaryotic mycelia

Approximately 25,000 fungi, including mushrooms, shelf fungi, puffballs, and rusts, are classified in the phylum Basidiomycota (FIGURE 31.11). The name derives from the basidium (L., "little pedestal"), a transient diploid stage in the organism's life cycle. The clublike shape of the basidium also gives rise to the common name club fungus.

Fig 31-11. Basidiomycetes (club fungi). These photographs showcase diverse basidiocarps, the fruiting bodies that produce sexual spores.

Basidiomycetes are important decomposers of wood and other plant material. The phylum also includes mycorrhiza-forming mutualists and plant parasites. Of all fungi, the saprobic basidiomycetes are best at decomposing the complex polymer lignin, an abundant component of wood. Many shelf fungi (FIGURE 31.11b) break down the wood of weak or damaged trees and continue to decompose the wood after the trees die. Two groups of basidiomycetes, the rusts and smuts, include particularly destructive plant parasites.

The life cycle of a club fungus usually includes a long-lived dikaryotic mycelium (FIGURE 31.12). Periodically, in response to environmental stimuli, this mycelium reproduces sexually by producing elaborate fruiting bodies called basidiocarps (see FIGURE 31.11). The numerous basidia of a basidiocarp are the sources of sexual spores. Asexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is much less common than in ascomycetes.

Fig 31-12. The life cycle of a mushroom-forming basidiomycete. 
			  
		Two haploid mycelia of opposite mating type undergo plasmogamy, 
			  
		creating a dikaryotic mycelium that grows faster than, and ultimately crowds out, the parent haploid mycelia. 
			  
		Environmental cues such as rain or temperature changes induce the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses that develop into basidiocarps (mushrooms, in this case). Cytoplasm streaming in from the mycelium swells the hyphae of mushrooms, causing them to "pop up" overnight. The dikaryotic mycelia of basidiomycetes are long-lived, generally producing a new crop of basidiocarps each year. 
			  
		The surfaces of the basidiocarp's gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia. 
			  
		Karyogamy produces diploid nuclei, which then undergo meiosis, 
			  
		each yielding four haploid nuclei. Each basidium grows four appendages, and one haploid nucleus enters each appendage and develops into a basidiospore (SEM inset). 
			  
		When mature, the basidiospores are propelled slightly (by electrostatic forces) into the spaces between the gills. After the spores drop below the cap, they are dispersed by the wind. 
			  
		The haploid basidiospores germinate in a suitable environment and grow into short-lived haploid mycelia.

A mushroom is an example of a basidiocarp. The cap of the mushroom supports and protects a large surface area of basidia on gills; each common, store-bought mushroom has a gill surface area of about 200 cm2. Such a mushroom may release a billion basidiospores, which drop beneath the cap and are blown away.

By concentrating growth in the hyphae of mushrooms, a basidiomycete mycelium can erect the fruiting structures in just a few hours. A ring of mushrooms, popularly called a fairy ring, may appear on a lawn overnight (FIGURE 31.13). Although the grass in the center of the ring is normal, you may notice after a few days that the grass beneath the ring is stunted and the grass just outside the garland of mushrooms is especially lush. As the underground mycelium grows outward, its center portion and the mushrooms above the center portion die because the mycelium has consumed all the available nutrients. Thus, the living mycelium is an expanding ring that produces mushrooms above it. The grass beneath the mushrooms is stunted because it cannot compete for minerals with the active mycelium. But the advancing mycelium secretes digestive agents ahead of it that decompose the organic matter in the soil, producing a lush growth of grass that absorbs the minerals that have become available. The fairy ring slowly increases in diameter as the mycelium advances at a rate of about 30 cm per year. Some giant fairy rings may be centuries old.

Fig 31-13. A fairy ring. The legendary explanation of these circles of fungi is that mushrooms spring up where fairies have danced in a ring on moonlit nights. Afterward, the tired fairies sit down on the mushrooms, but some of the mushrooms are sat on by toads. The mushrooms the fairies choose are edible by humans, but the "toadstools" are poisonous. See the text on page 624 to read an alternate explanation of fairy rings.

 Molds, yeasts, lichens, and mycorrhizae are specialized lifestyles that evolved independently in diverse fungal phyla

Certain ways of living that require both morphological and ecological adaptations have evolved independently among the zygote fungi, sac fungi, and club fungi. This section explores four fungal forms with highly specialized ways of life: molds, yeasts, lichens, and mycorrhizae.

Molds

Mention of fungi may bring the ubiquitous molds to mind. A mold is a rapidly growing, asexually reproducing fungus. The mycelia of these fungi grow as saprobes or parasites on a great variety of substrates. You are already familiar with one example, bread mold (Rhizopus; see FIGURE 31.6). Molds may go through a series of different reproductive stages. Early in life, a mold produces asexual spores. The term mold applies only to these asexual stages (FIGURE 31.14). Later, the same fungus may reproduce sexually, producing zygosporangia, ascocarps, or basidiocarps.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 31-14. A moldy orange."Blue mold" is usually caused by a species of Penicillium, an ascomycete. This mold reproduces asexually by producing chains of conidia on hyphae called conidiophores (right, SEM).

There are also molds that cannot be classified as zygomycetes, ascomycetes, or basidiomycetes because they have no known sexual stages. Those molds are collectively called deuteromycetes, or imperfect fungi (from the botanical use of the term perfect to refer to the sexual stages of life cycles). Imperfect fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. Note that this is an informal grouping without phylogenetic basis. Whenever a mycologist discovers a sexual stage in one of these fungi, the species is moved from the imperfect category to a particular phylum, depending on the type of sexual structures.

Yeasts

Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit liquid or moist habitats, including plant sap and animal tissues. Yeasts reproduce asexually, by simple cell division or by the pinching of small "bud cells" off a parent cell (FIGURE 31.15). Some yeasts reproduce sexually, by forming asci or basidia, and are classified as Ascomycota or Basidiomycota. Others are placed in the imperfect fungi because no sexual stages are known. Some fungi can grow as either single cells (yeasts) or as a filamentous mycelium, depending on the availability of nutrients.

Fig 31-15. Budding yeast. This micrograph shows Saccharomyces cerevisiae in various stages of budding (SEM).

Humans have used yeasts to raise bread and ferment alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. Only relatively recently have the yeasts involved been separated into pure culture for more controlled human use. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ascomycete, is the most important of all domesticated fungi (see FIGURE 31.15). The tiny yeast cells, available as many strains of baker's yeast and brewer's yeast, are very active metabolically. The cells release small bubbles of CO2 that leaven dough. Cultured anaerobically in breweries and wineries, Saccharomyces ferments sugars to alcohol. Researchers use Saccharomyces to study the molecular genetics of eukaryotes because these microbes are easy to culture and manipulate (see Chapter 19).

Some yeasts cause problems for humans. A pink yeast, Rhodotorula, grows on shower curtains and other moist surfaces in our homes. Another yeast is Candida, one of the normal inhabitants of moist human epithelial tissue, such as the vaginal lining. Certain circumstances can cause Candida to become pathogenic by growing too rapidly and releasing harmful substances ("yeast infections"). This can occur, for example, with an environmental change such as a pH shift, or when the immune system of the human host is compromised--by AIDS, for instance.

Lichens

At a distance, lichens are often mistaken for mosses or other simple plants growing on rocks, rotting logs, trees, and roofs (FIGURE 31.16). In fact, lichens are not mosses or any other kind of plant, nor are they even individual organisms. A lichen is a symbiotic association of millions of photosynthetic microorganisms held in a mesh of fungal hyphae. The fungal component is most commonly an ascomycete, but several basidiomycete lichens are known. The photosynthetic partners are usually unicellular or filamentous green algae or cyanobacteria. The merger of fungus and alga is so complete that lichens are actually given genus and species names, as though they were single organisms. Over 25,000 species have been described.

The fungus usually gives the lichen its overall shape and structure, and tissues formed by hyphae account for most of the lichen's mass. The algal component usually occupies an inner layer below the lichen surface (FIGURE 31.17). In most cases that have been examined, each partner provides things the other could not obtain on its own. The alga provides the fungus with food. Cyanobacteria in lichens fix nitrogen (see Chapter 27) and provide organic nitrogen. The fungus provides the alga with a suitable physical environment for growth. Lichens absorb most of the minerals they need either from dust in the air or from rain. The physical arrangement of hyphae retains water and minerals, allows for gas exchange, and protects the algae. Fungal pigments help shade the algae from intense sunlight. Some fungal compounds are toxic and prevent lichens from being eaten by consumers. The fungi also secrete acids, which aid in the uptake of minerals.

Fig 31-17. Anatomy of a lichen.

The fungi of many lichens reproduce sexually by forming ascocarps or basidiocarps. Lichen algae reproduce independently of the fungus by asexual cell division. As might be expected of "dual organisms," asexual reproduction as symbiotic units also occurs commonly, either by fragmentation of the parental lichen or by the formation of specialized structures called soredia (see FIGURE 31.17). Soredia are small clusters of hyphae with embedded algae.

The nature of the lichen symbiosis is complex and is probably best described as mutual exploitation instead of mutual benefit. Lichens are able to live in environments where neither fungi nor algae could live alone. While the fungal components do not grow alone in the wild, some lichen algae also occur as free-living organisms. The fungi and algae of some lichens have been experimentally separated and cultured. Such cultures look like free-living molds and algae; the cultured fungi do not produce lichen compounds, and the cultured lichen algae do not "leak" carbohydrates from their cells as they do in lichens. In some lichens, the fungus invades the algal cells with haustoria and may kill some of them, though not as fast as the alga replenishes its numbers by reproduction.

Lichens are important pioneers on newly cleared rock and soil surfaces, such as burned forests and volcanic flows. Physical penetration of the outer crystals of rocks and chemical attack of rock by lichen acids help break down the rock and establish soil-trapping lichens. This process makes it possible for a succession of plants to grow. Nitrogen-fixing lichens also add organic nitrogen to some ecosystems.

Some lichens tolerate severe cold. In the arctic tundra, herds of caribou and reindeer graze on carpets of reindeer lichen (reindeer "moss") at times of the year when other foods are unavailable. Lichens can also survive desiccation. When it is foggy or rainy, lichens may absorb more than ten times their weight in water. Photosynthesis begins almost immediately when the water content reaches 65%  to 75% . In dry air, lichens rapidly dehydrate, and photosynthesis stops. Thus, in arid climates lichens grow very slowly, often less than a millimeter per year. Some lichens are thousands of years old, rivaling the oldest plants as the elder organisms on Earth.

As tough as lichens are, many do not stand up very well to air pollution. Their passive mode of mineral uptake from rain and moist air makes them particularly sensitive to sulfur dioxide and other aerial poisons. The death of sensitive lichens and an increase in hardier species in an area can be an early warning that air quality is deteriorating.

Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizae are mutualistic associations of plant roots and fungi. The word mycorrhizae means "fungus roots," referring to the structures formed by both root cells and hyphae from the associated fungus (FIGURE 31.18). The anatomy of this symbiosis varies, depending on the type of fungus. The extensions of the fungal mycelium from the hyphae forming the mycorrhizae greatly increase the absorptive surface of the plant roots. The partners exchange minerals accumulated from the soil by the fungus for organic nutrients synthesized by the plant.

Mycorrhizae are enormously important in natural ecosystems and agriculture (FIGURE 31.19). Almost all vascular plants have mycorrhizae. The fungi involved are permanent associates with their hosts and periodically form fruiting bodies (structures for sexual reproduction). Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota all have members that form mycorrhizae. In fact, almost half of all species of mushroom-forming basidiomycetes live as mycorrhizae with oak, birch, and pine trees. The mushrooms that sprout around the bases of these trees are the surface evidence of the underground symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. (The structure and physiology of mycorrhizae are described in more detail in Chapter 36.)

It represents an experimental group of plants that researchers grew in soil treated with fungicide (poison that kills fungi). The plant's growth is stunted, probably due to a phosphorus deficiency. The plant on the right is from a control group with mycorrhizae, which enhance the uptake of phosphate and other minerals.





 Ecosystems depend on fungi as decomposers and symbionts

Fungi and bacteria are the principal decomposers that keep ecosystems stocked with the inorganic nutrients essential for plant growth. Without decomposers, carbon, nitrogen, and other elements would become tied up in organic matter. Plants and the animals they feed would starve because elements taken from the soil would not be returned (see Chapter 54).

Fungi are well adapted as decomposers of plant material. Their invasive hyphae enter the tissues and cells of dead organic matter, secreting exoenzymes that hydrolyze polymers, including the cellulose and lignin of plant cell walls. A succession of fungi, in concert with bacteria and, in some environments, invertebrate animals, are responsible for the complete breakdown of plant litter. The air is so loaded with fungal spores that as soon as a leaf falls or an insect dies, it is covered with spores and is soon infiltrated by saprobic hyphae.

We may applaud fungi that decompose forest litter or dung, but it is a different story when molds attack our fruit or our shower curtains. Between 10%  and 50%  of the world's fruit harvest is lost each year to fungal attack. Ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, also stimulates fungal spores on the fruit surface to germinate. This timing mechanism allows fungi to invade when fruit is most vulnerable and nutritious. A wood-digesting saprobe does not distinguish between a fallen oak limb and the oak planks of a boat. During the Revolutionary War, the British lost more ships to fungal rot than to enemy attack. Soldiers stationed in the tropics during World War II watched their tents, clothing, boots, and binoculars be destroyed by molds. Some fungi can even decompose certain plastics.





 Some fungi are pathogens

Of the 100,000 known species of fungi, about 30%  make their living as parasites, mostly on or in plants. For example, Ophiostoma ulmi, the ascomycete that causes Dutch elm disease, has drastically changed the landscape of the northeastern United States (FIGURE 31.20a). Accidentally introduced to the United States on logs that were sent from Europe to help pay World War I debts, the fungus is carried from tree to tree by bark beetles. Another ascomycete, Cryphonectria parasitica, has almost eliminated the native American chestnut. Fungi are also serious agricultural pests. Some species infect grain crops and cause tremendous economic losses each year. For example, the basidiomycete Puccinia graminis causes wheat rust (FIGURE 31.20b).

Some of the fungi that attack food crops are toxic to humans. For example, some species of the mold Aspergillus contaminate improperly stored grain and peanuts by secreting compounds called aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic. In another example, one type of ascomycete, Clavicepspurpurea, forms purple structures called ergots on rye (FIGURE 31.20c). If diseased rye is inadvertently milled into flour and consumed, poisons from the ergots cause gangrene, nervous spasms, burning sensations, hallucinations, and temporary insanity. One epidemic in about 944 A.D. killed more than 40,000 people in France. One of the hallucinogens that has been isolated from ergots is lysergic acid, the raw material from which LSD is made. On the other hand, toxins extracted from fungi often have medicinal uses when administered in weak doses. For example, an ergot compound is helpful in treating high blood pressure and stopping maternal bleeding after childbirth.

Animals are much less susceptible to parasitic fungi than are plants. Only about 50 species of fungi are known to be parasitic in humans and other animals. Their damage to hosts, however, is disproportionately large compared to their taxonomic diversity. In humans, fungi cause infections ranging from annoyances such as athlete's foot to deadly lung diseases.

The general term for a fungal infection is mycosis. Skin mycoses include the disease ringworm, so named because it appears as circular red areas on the skin. The ascomycetes that cause ringworm can infect almost any skin surface. Most commonly, they grow on the feet, causing the intense itching and blisters known as athlete's foot. Though highly contagious, athlete's foot and other ringworm infections can be treated with various fungicidal lotions and powders. Systemic mycoses, usually very serious, are fungal infections that spread throughout the body, usually from spores that are inhaled. Two examples are histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, which are both very serious diseases with tuberculosis-like symptoms. The yeast Candida albicans is an example of an opportunistic pathogen. That means it is a normal inhabitant of the human body that only causes problems such as vaginal yeast infections when some other change in the body's microbiology, chemistry, or immunology allows the yeast to grow unchecked. Opportunistic infections, including mycoses, have increased in the past few decades, partly because of AIDS, which compromises the immune system.





 Fungi are commercially important

It would not be fair to fungi to end our discussion with an account of diseases. Far more important are the benefits we derive from these interesting eukaryotes. We depend on them as decomposers and recyclers of organic matter.

Fungi also have a number of practical uses for humans. Most of us have eaten mushrooms, although we may not have realized that we were ingesting the fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) of subterranean fungi. And mushrooms are not the only fungi we eat. The distinctive flavors of certain kinds of cheeses, including Roquefort and blue cheese, come from the fungi used to ripen them. The soft drink industry uses a species of the ascomycete mold Aspergillus to produce citric acid for colas. Highly prized by gourmets are truffles, the fruiting bodies of certain mycorrhizal ascomycetes associated with tree roots (see FIGURE 31.9b). Their complex flavor is variously described as nutty, musky, cheesy, or all three. The fruiting bodies (ascocarps) release strong odors that attract mammal and insect consumers that excavate the truffles and disperse their spores. In some cases, the odors mimic sex attractants of certain mammals. Truffle hunters traditionally used pigs to locate their prizes, although dogs are now more commonly used.

More important in food production are unicellular fungi, the yeasts. As discussed on page 627, yeasts are used in baking, brewing, and winemaking. Fungi are medically valuable as well. Some fungi produce antibiotics used to treat bacterial diseases. In fact, the first antibiotic discovered was penicillin, made by the common mold Penicillium (FIGURE 31.21).

 Fungi colonized land with plants

The fossil record indicates that from their inception, terrestrial communities have been dependent on fungi as decomposers and symbionts. Much of the diversity of fungi we observe today may have had its phylogenetic origin in adaptive radiation when life began to colonize land. The oldest undisputed fossils of fungi date back 460 million years, about the time plants began to colonize land. Fossils of the first vascular plants from the late Silurian period have petrified mycorrhizae. Plants probably moved onto land in the company of fungi.

Molecular evidence supports the widely held view that the four fungal divisions are monophyletic (see FIGURE 31.4). The occurrence of flagella in the chytrids, representing the oldest lineage of fungi, indicates that fungal ancestors were aquatic flagellated organisms. Flagellated cells were probably lost in the chytrid lineage that led to the Zygomycota, as ancestral fungi became increasingly adapted for life on land. Many of the differences among the phyla Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota represent different solutions to the problem of reproducing and dispersing on land. These fungi may have diverged during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.





 Fungi and animals evolved from a common protistan ancestor

Animals probably evolved from aquatic flagellated organisms too, and there is compelling evidence that animals and fungi diverged from a common protistan ancestor. Comparisons of several proteins and ribosomal RNA indicate that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants (see FIGURE 28.8). We discuss animal phylogeny in more detail in Chapter 32.
