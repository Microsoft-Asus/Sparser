COLOMBO , Sri Lanka
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- A moderate Tamil political party on Saturday accused the Sri Lankan government and separatist rebels of killing at least 500 civilians during fighting in the country 's north .
The Tamil United Liberation Front , or TULF , said shelling and aerial bombing in the Jaffna peninsula left `` hundreds of civilians grievously wounded , '' and caused immense destruction to civilian property .
It was the first time a Tamil party made a categorical statement about war casualties in the north , the major arena in Sri Lanka 's 17-year insurgency .
The government denied that its military had targeted civilians ; the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam could not be reached for comment .
The TULF issued the statement after its executive committee met in the capital , Colombo , but it did not say how it got the information about the civilian casualties .
Although the battle for Jaffna has eased , 40,000 government soldiers were still stationed there anticipating attacks by the Tamil Tigers .
`` The Sri Lankan military always takes utmost care that civilians are not affected in any military operation , '' government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said , and called the Tamil party 's accusation `` unfounded . ''
It was impossible to check on the allegations independently , as reporters are barred by both the government and the rebels from visiting the war zone , and telephone links to the northern peninsula have been cut .
International aid agency workers have said many civilians were wounded in shelling and a handful of them were killed .
In addition , hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes .
The Tamil political party also appealed to both the sides to negotiate an end the conflict , saying civilians needed to resume their normal lives in Jaffna .
On Friday , the rebels rejected a government invitation to give up arms and join an Interim Council to govern Tamil majority areas .
The rebels have said they would accept nothing less than the establishment of a separate nation for the island nation 's 3.2 million minority Tamils , who they say are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese .
