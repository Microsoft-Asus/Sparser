This <span class="Emphasis2">osmoregulation</span> (management of the body’s water content and solute composition) is largely based on controlled movements of solutes between internal fluids and the external environment. This also regulates the movement of water, which follows solutes by osmosis. Animals must also remove various metabolic waste products before they accumulate to harmful levels.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The ultimate function of osmoregulation is to maintain the composition of the cytoplasm of the body’s cells, but most animals do this indirectly by managing the composition of an internal body fluid that bathes the cells. In insects and other animals with an open circulatory system, this fluid is the hemolymph (see Chapter 42). In vertebrates and other animals with a closed circulatory system, the cells are bathed in an interstitial fluid. The composition of interstitial fluid is controlled indirectly by managing the composition of blood. Animals often have complex organs, such as the kidneys of vertebrates, that are specialized for the maintenance of fluid composition.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
