MADRID , October 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Britain is reportedly expected to give up its objection against Spain 's request for entry into NATO 's integrated military command system .
The policy change , the press here reported today quoting Spanish officials as saying , would help pave the way for NATO 's reform of its commanding mechanism in southern Europe .
The officials , whose names were withheld , said Britain had already agreed to delink Spain 's bid for the integrated military command system with the bilateral dispute over Gibraltar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Gibraltar , a town and port on the south coast of Spain , formerly belonged to Spain but now is a British colony .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">As the two countries both claim sovereignty over Gibraltar , Spain has been imposing restrictions over activities on the waters and in the air space around the disputed territory .</ENAMEX>
What provides Britain as a leverage against these restrictions is Spain 's bid to fully incorporate into NATO and join the Western military alliance 's commanding mechanism in southern Europe .
Spain became NATO 's 16th , and the newest , member in 1982 .
Under a proposed NATO reform program , a new military command will open in Madrid once Spain enters into the integrated system , and a current commanding post in Gibraltar will be closed .
However , in July , British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told a NATO summit in Madrid that his country would veto the closure in Gibraltar if Spain does not lift its restrictions there .
The British stance was rejected by the Spanish government , and objected by other NATO members , who termed it as `` unacceptable , '' as it brought a bilateral dispute into the NATO reform process .
And as a latest development , Spanish officials said , the British government agreed to close the command post in Gibraltar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In addition , they said , it agreed with its Spanish counterpart to re-start negotiations about Gibraltar 's status after Spain successfully joins NATO 's integrated military command system .</ENAMEX>
