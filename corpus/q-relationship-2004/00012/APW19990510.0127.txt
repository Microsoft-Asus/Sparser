WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- --<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL"> Using hand-scribbled notes to support his claims , a Senate subcommittee chairman today accused the FBI of bottling up another agency 's report saying mechanical failure caused the crash of TWA Flight 800 .</ENAMEX>
`` It 's fair to say that the FBI hindered the investigation and the public 's and the families ' right to know .
And , in the process , in my view , the FBI risked public safety , '' said Sen. Charles Grassley .
The Iowa Republican 's assertion , which came at the start of a hearing on the investigation of the TWA crash , was based on contemporaneous notes taken by an official of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which said the FBI had forbidden that agency from delivering its finding to the National Transportation Safety Board .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But James Kallstrom , the former head of the FBI 's New York office , denied today that the bureau had been overzealous in its pursuit of a terrorist cause of the explosion and crash of the Boeing 747 airliner in July 1996 off the coast of Long Island , N.Y. `` </ENAMEX>With the massive , complex investigation conducted into this crash , if in the end the only criticism of the FBI is that we worked too hard , too long , and did too much , I will accept that criticism proudly , '' Kallstrom , now retired
The focus of the Senate hearing was a 24-page report by ATF .
Released six months after the crash , it concluded mechanical failure was the cause .
FBI officials said at the time that , with pieces of a mockup reconstruction of the plane not yet completed , it was too early to state a cause .
But others read different motives into the FBI 's failure to endorse the report 's findings early on , saying the agency clung to the belief that terrorists were behind the attack so that it could remain involved .
`` The FBI did n't want to hear about anything but a missile or a bomb , because otherwise there was no FBI case , '' Grassley told The Washington Post .
`` Their conduct was disturbing from the very beginning . ''
Grassley is chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight , which was holding today 's hearing .
The NTSB led the investigation into the Flight 800 crash .
The FBI and ATF were part of a task force working with the NTSB .
Witnesses were expected to provide testimony at the hearing that the FBI attempted to suppress the ATF report .
In Washington today , FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said , `` We did n't sit on this report .
It is dated Jan. 20 ; it got to -LRB- then- Assistant FBI Director -RRB- Jim Kallstrom on March 13 .
Where was it during those months ?
He forwarded it to Jim Hall at NTSB -LRB- National Transportation Safety Board -RRB- on March 17 . ''
`` The theory seems to be that because ATF comes out with this analysis , we should have forgotten other tests we were conducting here and at China Lake , a Navy weapons testing center in California , '' Scafidi continued .
`` We had witnesses who thought they saw a missile and had -LRB- television commentator -RRB- Pierre Salinger running around talking about possible missile attacks , '' he said .
`` If we 'd have stopped the investigation then , we 'd have been called premature .
We owed more than that to the families .
Sure , there are turf battles , but somebody has to be the ultimate answer-provider .
It 's our professional obligation to answer every question . ''
While Kallstrom denied that the ATF report was suppressed , he did say he did not want it publicized .
He said it would have been misleading to the public to imply that a conclusion had been drawn in the crash when one had not yet been reached .
`` Even though I did not want the report because it was premature , as soon as I received it , I forwarded a copy to NTSB and to the terrorist task force , '' he said .
`` The report was a gross violation of the protocol of the investigation and totally unprofessional to issue a report before the investigation was done , but unfortunately that is the signature of ATF , '' Kallstrom added .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The FBI said in the spring of 1997 that a mechanical malfunction caused the plane 's center fuel tanks to blow up .
Analyzing and testing was n't completed until November 1997 , when the FBI withdrew from the case , finding no evidence of a crime .
All 230 people died when TWA Flight 800 crashed into the ocean off Long Island shortly after takeoff .</ENAMEX>
