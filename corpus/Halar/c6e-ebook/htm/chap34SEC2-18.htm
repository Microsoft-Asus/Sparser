Order Primates includes <span class="Emphasis1">Homo sapiens</span> and its closest kin. We are primates.</p><p class="Header3">Some General Primate Characteristics</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Primates are difficult to define unambiguously in terms of morphological attributes, but most primates have hands and feet adapted for grasping, and, relative to other mammals, they have large brains and short jaws, giving them a flat face. Primates have forward-looking eyes, close together on the front of the face. They also have flat nails on their digits rather than the narrow claws of other mammals. There are other changes in the hands and feet, such as the evolution of the skin ridges on fingers (these account for our fingerprints). Primates, perhaps related to their large brains, also have relatively well-developed parental care and relatively complex social behavior.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The earliest primates were probably tree dwellers, shaped through natural selection to the demands of living in the trees. For example, the grasping hands and feet of primates are adaptations for hanging on to tree branches. All modern primates, except <span class="Emphasis1">Homo</span>, have a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes, enabling them to grasp onto branches with their feet. A similar separation of the thumb from the other fingers evolved in the hands of primates. Humans have a fully <span class="Emphasis2">opposable thumb;</span> that is, we can touch the ventral surface (fingerprint side) of the tip of all four fingers with the ventral surface of the thumb of the same hand. The thumb is relatively mobile and separate from the fingers in <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> primates, but a <span class="Emphasis1">fully</span> opposable thumb is found only in anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and humans). The opposable thumb, like the grasping foot, evolved first for gripping branches. In monkeys and apes, the opposable thumb functions in a grasping "power grip," but in humans, the opposable thumb has adaptations that enable more precise manipulation; we have a distinctive bone structure at the base of our thumbs associated with our "precision grip." The unique dexterity of humans represents descent with modification from ancestral hands adapted for life in the trees. Some of the other primate features also originated as adaptations for tree dwelling. For instance, the overlapping fields of vision of the two eyes enhance depth perception, an obvious advantage when brachiating (swinging). Excellent eye-hand coordination is also important for arboreal maneuvering. Humans, of course, do not live in trees, but we retain in modified form many of the traits that originally evolved there.</p><p class="Header3">Modern Primates</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The two subgroups of the Primates are the Prosimii and Anthropoidea. The <span class="Emphasis2">prosimians</span> ("premonkeys") probably resemble early arboreal primates (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.34</span>). The lemurs of Madagascar and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers that live in tropical Africa and southern Asia are examples of prosimians. The <span class="Emphasis2">anthropoids</span> include monkeys, apes, and humans. The oldest known anthropoid fossils, discovered in China in mid-Eocene strata about 45 million years old, support the hypothesis that tarsiers are the prosimians most closely related to anthropoids (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.35</span>, p. 708).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-34','../fig/big/fig34-34.jpg','fig34-34');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-34.jpg" alt="fig34-34" name="myfig34-34"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-34.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Prosimians: crowned lemurs.</span></span></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-35','../fig/big/fig34-35.jpg','fig34-35');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-35.jpg" alt="fig34-35" name="myfig34-35"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-35.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A phylogenetic tree of primates.</span> The fossil record indicates that the prosimian and anthropoid lineages were diverging by about 50 million years ago. Among the anthropoids, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and the apes (represented today by several species of gibbons, the orangutan, the gorilla, and chimpanzees) have been evolving on separate lineages for over 40 million years. Molecular evidence shows that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than are any other apes.

By that time, South America and Africa had drifted apart. The first monkeys probably evolved in the Old World, and may have reached South America by rafting on logs or other debris from Africa. What is certain is that New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations during their many millions of years of separation (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.36</span>). All New World monkeys are arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include ground-dwelling as well as arboreal species.

With the exception of gibbons, modern apes are larger than monkeys, with relatively long arms and short legs and no tails. Although all the apes are capable of brachiation (traveling by swinging from branch to branch in trees), only gibbons and orangutans are primarily arboreal. Social organization varies among the genera of apes; gorillas and chimpanzees are highly social.
