NAZRAN , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Four Russian soldiers were killed when rebel fighters ambushed a military unit in central Chechnya in the second attack on a convoy in two days , an official said Saturday .
The convoy was fired upon Friday while moving through the Vedeno Gorge , a region that has seen heavy rebel activity since the start of the war , according to an official with the pro- Russian civilian government in Chechnya .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , did not have further casualty figures .
The attack was one of 12 carried out by the rebels in the last 24 hours across Chechnya , the official said .
Six soldiers were killed Thursday when rebels ambushed a convoy .
Russian special forces were sent to the area of Friday 's ambush and nearby villages were blocked off as troops searched for the attackers .
Rebel ambushes and checkpoint attacks have sapped the morale of Russian troops , though both sides have refrained from major offensives in recent weeks .
On Saturday , Russian helicopters rocketed the mountains of southern Chechnya .

Russian officials are planning to return Chechnya 's civilian government headquarters to Grozny from the nearby city of Gudermes .
Rebels were trying to block the move , the civilian government official said Saturday .
Akhmad Kadyrov , head of the civilian government , sharply criticized the Russian military for its harsh action in Chechnya , including mass detentions as part of `` mopping-up '' operations .
`` I spoke openly against the Chechen illegal armed formations because they terrorized the people , but the same people continue to suffer from the forces for whose protection they hoped so much , '' Kadyrov said in Gudermes , according to the Interfax news agency .
`` Further employment of mass mopping-up operations can lead to serious negative consequences , '' Kadyrov was quoted as saying .
Russian forces returned to Chechnya last September after rebel raids on a neighboring region and four bomb blasts across Russia killed some 300 people .
Russia blamed the blasts on Chechen rebels , though no one has been convicted of involvement .
On Saturday , residents of the city of Volgodonsk marked the one-year anniversary of the apartment bombing there that killed 17 people .
That explosion was the last of the four and Russian troops entered Chechnya shortly after .
About 2,000 people attended a mourning gathering in the city .
Konstantin Galkin , the city 's chief psychiatrist , estimated that 10 to 15 percent of the city are still traumatized by the bombing .
