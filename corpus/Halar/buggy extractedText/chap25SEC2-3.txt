 The fossil record is a substantial, but incomplete, chronicle of evolutionary history

The discovery of a fossil is the culmination of a sequence of improbable coincidences. First, the organism had to die in the right place at the right time for burial conditions to favor fossilization. Then the rock layer containing the fossil had to escape geologic processes that destroy or severely distort rocks, such as erosion, pressure from superimposed strata, or the melting of rocks that occurs at some locations. If the fossil was preserved, there is only a slight chance that a river carving a canyon or some other process will expose the rock containing the fossil. The chance that someone will find the fossil is even more remote, although, of course, discovery is more probable for people who are purposefully looking for fossils. No wonder the fossil record is incomplete: A substantial fraction of species that have lived probably left no fossils, most fossils that formed have been destroyed, and only a fraction of the existing fossils have been discovered.

The fossil record, far from being a complete sample of organisms of the past, is slanted in favor of species that existed for a long time, were abundant and widespread, and had shells or hard skeletons. Paleontologists, like all historians, must reconstruct the past from incomplete records. Even with its limitations, however, the fossil record is a remarkably detailed document of phylogeny over the vast scale of geologic time. The order of sedimentary strata records the sequence of biological change, and dating methods tell us approximately how long ago the changes occurred. Also recorded in rocks is the chronology of environmental changes associated with evolutionary changes in life. We now turn to some of the major changes in Earth's environments that have caused significant transformations of life.
