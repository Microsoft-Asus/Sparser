Under international pressure to curb its nuclear weapons capability , Pakistan said Thursday it supports immediately starting negotiations for a treaty to ban the production of material used to make nuclear weapons .
Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram told the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament , however , that his government wants negotiations to deal with neighboring India 's larger stockpile of plutonium and highly enriched uranium , which are used to make nuclear weapons .
Akram acknowledged the proposed treaty has been a main topic between the U.S. and Pakistani governments as Washington seeks ways to contain the South Asian arms race since India and Pakistan set off nuclear explosions earlier this year .
His statement came as top foreign ministry officials from India and Pakistan resumed talks in Sri Lanka .
On Wednesday , their prime ministers broke a yearlong stalemate and agreed to try again to resolve their territorial and other disputes .
At talks last week in Islamabad , he said , `` Pakistan and the United States agreed to support the immediate commencement of negotiations '' on a treaty to ban production of nuclear-weapons material .
At those talks , Pakistan pressed for international mediation on the Kashmir dispute with neighboring India , while the United States urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty .
Pakistan 's signing that treaty would depend on `` assurance against the possibility of further nuclear testing by India , '' Akram said Thursday .
He said Pakistan was prepared for a separate test-ban agreement with India and that it `` is not interested in further escalation up the nuclear ladder with India . ''
Conference delegations said it remained to be seen what other key countries , such as Brazil and Egypt , would say to the proposal that a committee be set up to discuss action on uranium and plutonium issue .
