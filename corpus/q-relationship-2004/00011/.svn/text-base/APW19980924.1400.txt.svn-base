Washington 's accusations of a Cuban espionage ring are ridiculous , the Cuban foreign minister said Thursday in a speech that also attacked the U.S. embargo on his country .
Roberto Robaina used a speech to world leaders at the General Assembly 's annual debate to blast the embargo , calling it `` the grossest , most serious and systematic violation of human rights as a whole . ''
He said that the uncovering of a Cuban spy ring that U.S. prosecutors said was the largest ever exposed in the United States since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 , was `` laughable . ''
`` I am sure that you understand that the most ridiculous and laughable thing that has occurred these days in the nation of scandals is that the world 's biggest spy , the United States , accuse of espionage the world 's most spied country , Cuba . ''
Four men , including three Americans , were killed when a Cuban MiG fighter jet shot down two Brothers planes over international waters in February 1996 .
Soon afterward , federal officials looked into whether spies played any part in the shooting .
Ten people were later arrested and charged with spying for Cuba .
Gonzalez rejected U.S. criticism of human rights violations in his country , and accused the United States of preparing a `` new vendetta '' against Cuba .
`` The international community should never allow such a noble and compelling cause as that of human rights to be held hostage to mean political interests , '' Gonzalez said .
Upholding his nation 's communist system , he said capitalism was responsible for the financial problems in global markets .
`` The process of globalization and neo-liberal internationalization of the world economy has today multiplied the advantages for the developed countries , to the detriment of the increasingly underdeveloped economies , '' Gonzalez said .
He said that the inequitable trade between the rich and the poor was `` more theft and aberrant swindle than trade . ''
