In the documentary `` The Italian - Americans II : A Beautiful Song , '' which has its premiere on Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WLIW -LRB- Channel 21 -RRB- , a Long Island public television station that broadcasts throughout the New York area , Nick Stellino , a cookbook author of Italian descent , describes the way he and family members used hand gestures when speaking to one another .
As Stellino explains , there was more to these gesticulations than the casual observer might suspect .
Each family member adopted and honed his or her own singular flourish : Stellino himself liked to jab at the sky , while his father favored a to-and-fro motion with hands in front of chest , and his brother Mario adopted a dramatic shoulder-rolling arm movement .
The gestures were like signatures , within which could be found clues to the speaker 's personality .
Stellino makes a colorful point that is central to the premise of this one-hour documentary .
In all of the distinctive characteristics of America 's various ethnic groups -- those quirks and curiosities that have often formed the basis of ethnic jokes and stereotypes -- there is , upon closer inspection , complexity and richness .
Hence , Stellino embraces that old ethnic saw that Italians `` speak with their hands '' and shows us that in all those flying hands , there is a depth of feeling and a flair for individual expression that is to be envied , not mocked .
There are more than a few such revelations to be found in `` The Italian - Americans II , '' the latest installment in a series of documentaries on American ethnic groups produced by WLIW .
The series , which has also featured shows on Jewish - Americans , Irish - Americans and Polish - Americans -LRB- all of which have been picked up by PBS for national broadcast -RRB- , employs the basic talking-heads-and-old-snapshots approach of Ken Burns and his many imitators .
Each documentary tries to create a kind of warm and fuzzy photo-album profile of each ethnic group and has a tendency to praise that group to the heavens , often citing the same virtues across the board : strong work ethic , solid family values , religious piety and the ability to make great food -LRB- the Irish excepted on that one -RRB- .
But the shows do provide small surprises here and there -LRB- Did you know that the polka , revered by Polish - Americans , is not popular in Poland ? -RRB- and the occasional larger insight as they peel back the layers of familiar customs to show their greater meaning .
Some of the documentaries have met with tepid press reviews , but no matter ; the series has undeniably struck a chord with its audience , largely made up of members of the groups depicted .
The series has been drawing significant numbers of viewers .
The real measure of the series ' success , however , is its ability to raise funds for public television .
Like those old reruns of `` The Lawrence Welk Show '' that PBS traditionally trotted out during pledge drives , WLIW 's ethnic shows cause the station telephones to ring off the hook .
When the first documentary profiling Italian - Americans had its premiere a year ago , it became the most successful production in the station 's history , raising a remarkable -LRB- by local public television standards -RRB- $ 120,000 in one hour .
The station 's executives responded to this happy phenomenon in much the same way Hollywood studios do upon discovering an unexpected hit in their midst ; a sequel was quickly produced .
The station has also produced and run a sequel to its first Jewish American documentary , and there are more ethnic shows in the pipeline .
Programmers at WLIW -LRB- which has a lower profile than its larger sister station , WNET , but is nevertheless the country 's fourth-leading public television station in viewership -RRB- had no idea there was such a hunger for ethnic fare when they first became involved with the subject matter , said WLIW 's president , Terrel Cass .
`` We were looking for some kind of nostalgic program to do , '' he said , because the station had previously produced a documentary about New York 's past that was popular .
At first , the plan was to make a documentary about the Lower East Side of Manhattan , but then the focus shifted to one of the primary ethnic groups inhabiting that neighborhood , Jewish - Americans .
The resulting program , `` A Laugh , a Tear , a Mitzvah , '' had its premiere in November 1996 and , according to Cass , `` people went crazy over it . ''
The response to that film and others in the series may be part of a larger sociological trend .
While members of American ethnic groups have historically tended to focus more on assimilation than on celebrating their roots , that has gradually changed in the last 20 to 30 years .
`` Among white ethnic groups , there has been an awakening of interest in their own culture and background , '' said Aileen Riotto Sirey , a New York psychotherapist who has studied ethnicity and appears as a commentator in `` The Italian - Americans II . ''
This relatively new strain of ethnic pride , says Ms. Sirey , seems to have first gained momentum after the civil rights movement of the 1960s , which called attention to group identity .
It manifests itself in the growing popularity of ethnic cultural festivals and in more subtle changes like the tendency of modern celebrities , unlike their predecessors , not to change their ethnic names .
Consider Bernie Schwartz , who became Tony Curtis , or Margarita Cansino , who became Rita Hayworth , compared with Al Pacino , Emilio Estevez or Leonardo DiCaprio .
Suzanne Strempek Shea , an author whose books focus on Polish - American life , said members of some American ethnic groups were now far enough removed from the immigrant experience that they might finally feel comfortable embracing it .
First -generation immigrants are often preoccupied with fitting in , Ms. Shea added , while the second generation tries to create a whole new American identity .
`` It is only the third generation , '' she said , `` that starts to look back . ''
According to Ms. Sirey , that 's a healthy thing to do .
Recent `` ethnotherapy '' studies , she says , have examined the relationships between ethnic awareness and self-esteem and found a connection .
`` When people have a better understanding of their cultural background , they usually begin to feel they have more control over their lives , '' Ms. Sirey said , adding that such people are often less encumbered by the emotional baggage -- fear of being stereotyped , anxieties about being different , extreme class consciousness -- that can be part of the ethnic experience .
While the hunger for information about ethnic backgrounds may be growing , many depictions of certain ethnic groups on television and in film continue to be oversimplified and often negative .
In that regard , the WLIW series has been a welcome exception , to which viewers have responded .
When the station first showed `` A Laugh , a Cry , a Mitzvah , '' said Cass , `` for once , this was a program about Jewish culture that was not focused on the Holocaust ; it was a warm celebration of Jewish life . ''
As the series was expanded to cover other ethnic groups , the producers continued to accentuate the positive and generally ignore the negative .
The shows are `` not meant to dig up the things that ethnic groups do n't want to hear and have been hearing too much through the years , '' said Roy Hammond , the executive producer of the series .
Hammond points out , for example , that many media depictions of Italian - Americans involve organized crime , `` even though that has nothing to do with the lives of most Italian - Americans , '' he said .
And so , in `` The Italian - Americans II , '' there are fond tributes to Mario Lanza , Joe DiMaggio , Frank Sinatra and Fiorello La Guardia , but no trace of Al Capone .
`` After we first showed ` The Italian - Americans , ' '' said Hammond , `` one of the reactions we heard was , ` Finally , something about Italians that 's not about the Mafia ! '
'' While it 's understandable that some `` Godfather '' -weary Italian - Americans would welcome such an approach , others may find `` The Italian - Americans II , '' along with other shows in the series , a bit too sanitized .
And perhaps a bit too eager to flatter the audience that calls to make contributions to the station .
`` Every culture has certain problems and there 's nothing wrong with talking about that , '' said Ms. Sirey .
For example , she noted that the closeness of families in traditional Italian - American communities has sometimes caused members of the group to forgo far-flung opportunities so they can remain close to the nest .
Next up is a profile of Greek - Americans , to be followed by one on Puerto Rican - Americans .
Interestingly , the man behind the series , Hammond , is from Texas and sees himself as `` not very ethnic at all . ''
But he says working on the series has changed his thinking about the notion of the melting pot .
`` When you see these rich ethnic cultures still in existence in New York , it makes you realize that this is something that is n't available in many other parts of the country , where some of the cultural differences between people have melted away , '' he said .
`` I think the message we 're trying to get across with the series is that we do n't want those differences to disappear completely .
Different is good . ''
