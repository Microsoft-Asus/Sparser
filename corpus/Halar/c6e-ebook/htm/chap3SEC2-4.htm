In other words, ice floats. While other materials contract when they solidify, water expands. The cause of this exotic behavior is, once again, hydrogen bonding. At temperatures above 4&#176;C, water behaves like other liquids, expanding as it warms and contracting as it cools. Water begins to freeze when its molecules are no longer moving vigorously enough to break their hydrogen bonds. As the temperature reaches 0&#176;C, the water becomes locked into a crystalline lattice, each water molecule bonded to the maximum of four partners (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.5</span>). The hydrogen bonds keep the molecules at "arm’s length," far enough apart to make ice about 10% less dense (10% fewer molecules for the same volume) than liquid water at 4&#176;C. When ice absorbs enough heat for its temperature to rise above 0&#176;C, hydrogen bonds between molecules are disrupted. As the crystal collapses, the ice melts, and molecules are free to slip closer together. Water reaches its greatest density at 4&#176;C and then begins to expand as the molecules move faster. Keep in mind, however, that even in liquid water, many of the molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds, though only transiently: The hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking and reforming.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig3-5','../fig/big/fig3-5.jpg','fig3-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig3-5.jpg" alt="fig3-5" name="myfig3-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 3-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The structure of ice.</span> In ice, each molecule is hydrogen-bonded to four neighbors in a three-dimensional crystal.

If ice sank, then eventually all ponds, lakes, and even oceans would freeze solid, making life as we know it impossible on Earth. During summer, only the upper few inches of the ocean would thaw. Instead, when a deep body of water cools, the floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist under the frozen surface (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.6</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig3-6','../fig/big/fig3-6.jpg','fig3-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig3-6.jpg" alt="fig3-6" name="myfig3-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 3-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Floating ice and the fitness of the environment.</span> Floating ice becomes a barrier that protects the liquid water below from the colder air.
