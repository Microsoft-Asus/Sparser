The U.N. is demanding freedom of movement for its personnel in the DRC , and the `` full participation '' in the peace process of all political factions in the country .
Kabila , who has reportedly refused to enter into dialogue with the rebels , said recently that the U.N. peacekeepers could not enter areas under his control .
U.N. Secretary -general Kofi Annan last Friday appointed Abubakar as the U.N. special envoy to the DRC .
The appointment came in the wake of a call by Kabila for review of the Lusaka peace agreement signed by relevant states last year to end the armed insurgency against his government .
