LAGOS , May 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The World Food Program -LRB- WFP -RRB- has begun a relief operation to help the tens of thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees fleeing to neighboring Guinea and the remnants of the dislodged junta in the east since March this year .
According to a WFP regional manager , the organization is rushing relief goods , mainly food , from Cote d 'Ivoire and Liberia into Guinea to alleviate the poor situation of the refugees .
In the last two and half weeks , WFP had brought in some 3,000 tons of food for this purpose , he said Friday , quoted by a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here .
The official said the WFP is in a hurry because the coming of the rainy season will make it very difficult for convoy to reach the refugees camps which lie very isolated .
The WFP estimated that about 150,000 Sierra Leonean refugees have crossed the border into Guinea since March .
The figure is closed to that of 148,000 registered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- .
Both the WFP and UNHCR agree that the situation of the refugees is serious .
`` Many of them are very sick '' with malaria and other diseases , the WFP manager said .
A number of people , including children , are now said to be living in the bush and feeding on wild fruits to keep alive , according to the UNHCR .
As the tense fighting between the west African peace-keeping force and the remnants of the junta forces and allied rebels is continuing in eastern Sierra Leone , the WFP is expecting more refugees to cross the border into Guinea .
