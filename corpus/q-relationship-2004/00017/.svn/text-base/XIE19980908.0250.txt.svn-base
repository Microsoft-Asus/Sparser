BUCHAREST , September 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Russian economic crisis has hit the Romanian government 's ability to carry out this year 's economic plan , said Jan Diaconescu , chairman of the Romanian parliament 's Chamber of Deputies , Monday .
According to the local Mediafax News Agency , Diaconescu said that although the economic relationship between Russia and Romania was weaker than it used to be , Russia 's financial turmoil would cause problems in Romania .
Many foreign investors had already withdrawn their capital , causing turbulence in the stock market and foreign exchange market .
Foreign companies which had intended to participate in the privatization of big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises also withdrew , setting back the reform process of those enterprises .
The normal income channel of the state budget was also affected .
To ease the hardship and keep the budget deficit within allowable limits , the government adopted a series of measures to increase taxation and cut public spending .
Russia ranks as Romania 's third largest trading partner .
Last year , bilateral trade amounted to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars , of which Romanian exports accounted for only 250 million dollars .
Experts say the Russian crisis may not directly affect Romanian exports , while some economists say it may intensify the fierce competition with members of the Commonwealth of Independent States -LRB- CIS -RRB- .
Russia is the main importer of goods from CIS countries , but the withering of the Russian economy has compelled them to seek new markets .
Romanian President Emil Constantinescue said the Russian crisis was compounding the difficulties of an already depressed Romanian economy .
