The hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight that was taken on a 15-hour odyssey across three countries before landing in Afghanistan demanded Saturday that India release a Pakistani religious leader and several Kashmiri fighters .
The hijackers , who are believed to be Islamic militants supportive of Kashmir 's independence from India , are holding 161 captives .
As the standoff struggled through its second day , they received food Saturday at Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and also threatened to blow up the plane , an A300 Airbus seized while en route to New Delhi from Nepal .
There were conflicting reports on whether the plane had been refueled .
A spokesman for the Taliban , Afghanistan 's ruling militia , which has its headquarters in Kandahar , told the BBC and The Associated Press that the hijackers were demanding the release of Maulana Masood Azhar , a Muslim cleric supportive of Kashmiri independence from Indian rule , and several Kashmiri fighters .
All of them are reportedly being held in Indian jails .
Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil , the Taliban 's foreign minister , said that one of the hijackers had identified himself as Azhar 's brother , Ibrahim .
He said the hijackers , who were armed with grenades , pistols , and knives when they seized the A300 Airbus , had threatened to blow up the plane .
The hijackers , who were armed with grenades , pistols and knives when they seized the plane , have killed at least one man , and there were unconfirmed reports of up to four other bodies on the plane .
The body of the dead man , whose identity was not certain , was flown to New Delhi late last night , along with 27 passengers freed when the plane was in Dubai during its odyssey on Friday .
One released passenger reportedly told relatives that the dead man had ignored orders not to look at the hijackers and was stabbed by one of them .
Taliban troops were guarding the plane Saturday , but Muttawakil said the Taliban would not negotiate with the hijackers and insisted that the United Nations do so instead .
The Taliban has said it will not grant the hijackers asylum , and it has denied any connection with the hijackers .
`` We do not want them to stay here and we have told the United Nations this .
They should intervene , '' Muttawakil said .
In New York , a U.N. spokeswoman said the world body had not received an official request from the Taliban but `` stands ready to help in any way they can . ''
The U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan , Erick de Mul , was heading to Kandahar from abad , U.N. officials said .
He was expected to arrive Sunday .
But the officials said his mission was to provide `` humanitarian aid , '' , not to negotiate with the hijackers .
Earlier , the Indian prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , said his government would not bow to any hijacker demand .
India has asked the Taliban not to let the plane take off again .
Fueling speculation about a possible rescue mission , India 's minister of external affairs , Jaswant Singh , said that he expected `` developments to take shape '' sometime Sunday morning .
Muslim militant secessionists have been waging a bitter and protracted insurgency in Indian -held Kashmir , demanding either outright independence for the Himalayan state or union with Islamic Pakistan .
The Pakistani government leased a statement Saturday demning the hijacking .
`` Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism , cluding hijacking , '' the statement said .
`` Pakistan cannot allow body to embroil it in such dastardly acts . ''
Azhar , who traveled to India in 1992 to help anti- Indian militants in Kashmir , belongs to a rich land-owning family in Pakistan , according to Indian security officials .
He was arrested in 1994 by Indian security in Anantnag , a small town in the disputed northern state of Jammu and Kashmir .
He is being held in a high-security jail in Kot Bhalwal , near Jammu , the state 's winter capital .
His group , the Harakat ul- Mujahedeen , which was formerly called Harakat ul- Ansar , has tried several times to use kidnappings as a way of freeing him , but failed .
In 1995 , the group kidnapped six Western tourists , including one American .
One was killed , one escaped and four are still missing and now feared dead .
Their abductors demanded the release of 21 of their jailed comrades in return for the six hostages .
India refused .
In October , the group claimed responsibility for a grenade attack in Kashmir that killed three people .
The hijackers seized control of the plane shortly after it took off from Katmandu , Nepal , at 4 : 25 p.m. local time Friday .
The plane then made stops in India , Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before landing in Kandahar Saturday morning .
Nepal 's government Friday suspended all officials on duty at Katmandu airport at the time of departure , and later reports said that four airport workers had been arrested in connection with the hijacking .
India has long described Katmandu as the weak link in air security in South Asia .
`` All the customs , immigration , civil aviation and police officials that were on duty on that shift have been suspended and face investigation , '' Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Bijaya Gachchedar told reporters .
He did not give the number of people suspended .
Muttawakil of the Taliban said that he had met two of the hijackers , and he speculated that they were Kashmiri ; passengers freed in Dubai said that the group of five may also have included an Afghan and a Nepalese .
Initial reports had suggested that the hijackers were Sikhs .
The Sikh Council on Religion and Education , an organization based in Washington , issued a statement Saturday condemning the hijacking but also expressing concern about the assumption that the hijackers are Sikh .
Noting reports that some of the hijackers wore turbans , the statement said that `` many other ethnic , nationalities and religious groups wear turbans in Asia . ''
