<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Japan 's coast guard warned Wednesday it will block a small flotilla of boats carrying Chinese nationalists from landing on a chain of islands at the center of a territorial dispute </ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The coast guard has dispatched about 30 cutters and other ships to intercept the six vessels , which carry protesters from Hong Kong and Taiwan , said Yusuke Ono , a spokesman for Japan 's Maritime Safety Agency</ENAMEX> .
The protest vessels were spotted Wednesday morning about 44 kilometers -LRB- 28 miles -RRB- southwest of the disputed archipelago , known as the Senkaku in Japan , but the Diaoyu by Chinese speakers .
The uninhabited , rocky islets lie midway between Taiwan and Japan 's southern island of Okinawa .
They are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan .
Ono said the Japanese coast guard has issued warnings to the boats to turn back .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">If the protesters continue , he said Japanese ships will try to block or encircle them before they reach the islands .</ENAMEX>
Five of the vessels were Taiwanese and likely left the northern Taiwanese port of Keelung on Tuesday night , Ono said .
He did n't know how many people were on board the boats .
Ethnic Chinese nationalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan have tried repeatedly in the past to land on the islands to protest Japanese control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In a heated confrontation in May of last year , Japanese coast guard ships blocked , nudged and collided with a fleet of 28 boats carrying Hong Kong and Taiwan protesters who wanted to land on the islands and tear down a lighthouse and markers put up by Japanese nationalists </ENAMEX>.
The confrontation followed a visit to the islands by a Japanese right-wing lawmaker that incited a surge of nationalism in Hong Kong and Taiwan , where many still carry bitter anti- Japanese memories .
Japan occupied Hong Kong during World War II and colonized Taiwan for 50 years until 1945 .
In 1996 , a Hong Kong activist drowned after jumping into waters near the islands from one of several protest boats that had come from Taiwan and Hong Kong .
The last attempt to reach the islands by Chinese nationalists was in September 1997 , when rough seas forced a vessel from Hong Kong carrying eight protesters to turn back .
