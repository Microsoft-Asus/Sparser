The colors we see as visible light are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A pigment is a substance that absorbs visible light of specific wavelengths. The action spectrum of photosynthesis does not exactly match the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a,</span> the main photosynthetic pigment in plants, because accessory pigments (chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> and various carotenoids) absorb different wavelengths of light and pass the energy on to chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a.</span></p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">A pigment goes from a ground state to an excited state when a photon boosts one of its electrons to a higher-energy orbital. The pigments of chloroplasts are built into the thylakoid membrane near molecules called primary electron acceptors, which trap the excited electrons before they return to the ground state. Pigment molecules are clustered in an antenna complex surrounding a chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a</span> molecule at the reaction center. Photons absorbed anywhere in the antenna can pass their energy along to energize this chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a,</span> which then passes an electron to a nearby primary electron acceptor. The antenna complex, the reaction-center chlorophyll, and the primary electron acceptor make up a photosystem, a light-harvesting unit built into the thylakoid membrane. There are two kinds of photosystems. Photosystem I contains P700 chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a</span> molecules at the reaction center; photosystem II contains P680 molecules.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Noncyclic electron flow involves both photosystems and produces NADPH, ATP, and oxygen. Cyclic electron flow employs only photosystem I, producing ATP but no NADPH or O<SUB>2</SUB>. ATP production during the light reactions is called photophosphorylation. The mechanism is chemiosmosis. The redox reactions of the electron transport chain that connects the two photosystems generate an H<SUP>+</SUP> gradient across the thylakoid membrane. ATP synthase uses this proton-motive force to make ATP.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity10C:<span class="Emphasis1">
