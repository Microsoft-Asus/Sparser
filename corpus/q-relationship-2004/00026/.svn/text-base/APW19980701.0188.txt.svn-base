<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Russian space officials postponed a decision on whether the Mir space station will have to be discarded ahead of schedule because of a lack of government funding</ENAMEX> , a report said Wednesday .
The Mir 's current two-man crew plans to leave the station Aug. 25 , and space official still do n't know if they can afford to send a replacement team .
A decision has to be made before the end of July in order to complete flight preparations .
No extension of the current team 's stay is possible because the working life of their escape capsule runs out in late August .
Space experts had been planning to discuss the funding problem Thursday , but the meeting has been postponed for at least a week , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
At a session last week , top space officials sent a letter to Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko asking the government to pay up .
They want to get a response before deciding the Mir 's future .
The government has n't allocated any money for Mir operations this year , and still owes 440 million rubles -LRB- dlrs 70 million -RRB- for last year 's missions , space officials said .
Russian space officials want to keep the station in orbit until the end of 1999 , and that would cost about 2 billion rubles -LRB- dlrs 320 million -RRB- , ITAR - Tass reported .
Abandoning the Mir in August could cause problems .
Left alone , the 130-ton station will gradually spin out of orbit and fall back to Earth within two years -- with large pieces possibly landing in populated areas .
Discarding the Mir in a controlled fashion will be more expensive .
To guide the station 's descent to Earth , Russia would have to launch several cargo ships over a short period to dock with the station .
The cargo ships would use their engines to direct Mir into lower orbits .
Most or all of the Mir is expected to burn up during re-entry into the Earth 's atmosphere .
The Mir has been in orbit for more than 12 years .
