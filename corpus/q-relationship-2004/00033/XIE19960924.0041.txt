BEIJING , September 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said at a press conference here this afternoon that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China , and China 's position on this issue remains unchanged .
The Diaoyu Islands have been part of the Chinese territory since ancient times , he said .
But the Japanese side has recently created disturbances on the issue , which has seriously encroached on China 's territorial integrity and sovereignty and is sure to arouse strong indignation among all Chinese , including Hong Kong , Macao and Taiwan compatriots , he said .
The Chinese people 's determination to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity will never change , Shen added .
He said he hoped that the Japanese side should adopt an appropriate attitude and fully understand the gravity of the issue , and not create any new disturbances .
Shen held that the Japanese side should stop any actions that encroach on China 's sovereignty , and that it has a responsibility to see that no new disturbances will be created .
Touching upon a recent Japan - US agreement , which stated that the two sides have the right to interfere if there is any trouble around Japan , Shen recalled past events and said that `` the real threat in our region is Japan . ''
He said that during the World War Two , the war of aggression launched by the Japanese militarists against Asian countries caused great suffering for Asian people -- including the Japanese people .
Peace in the Asia - Pacific region should be maintained jointly by the governments and people of Asian countries , he pointed out .
He added that the agreement is a bilateral arrangement between Japan and the US , and if this arrangement exceeds the bilateral realm by aiming at a third party and concerning interests of other countries , it will make the situation develop in a complicated way .
He said he hoped that the Japanese government can keep clear-minded about this issue .
