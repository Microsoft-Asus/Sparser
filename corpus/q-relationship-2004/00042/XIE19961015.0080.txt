BEIJING , October 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang today asked countries concerned to stay alert about Taiwan authorities ' separatist activities in the international community .
He said Taiwan authorities , who have ulterior political motives , have engaged in activities recently to promote the acceptance of `` two Chinas '' or `` one China , one Taiwan '' by every possible means .
They are attempting to separate Taiwan from the motherland by destroying the relations between China and those countries which have diplomatic ties with China , he pointed out .
The spokesman said he hopes that countries concerned stay alert about the political scheme of the Taiwan autorities in order to prevent any adverse influence on their bilateral relations with China .
The spokesman made the remarks here this afternoon in response to reports by the media in Taiwan alleging that a communique of `` mutual recognition '' between `` The Republic of China '' and Fiji has been signed .
Shen said the Chinese ambassador to Fiji recently demanded clarification from the Fiji side on the alleged communique of `` mutual recognition '' with the Taiwan authorities .
According to the Fiji side , he said , Fiji has never signed such an agreement with Taiwan , nor has it recognized Taiwan as a `` sovereign state '' or `` official government . ''
Shen noted that the Fiji government has reaffirmed to adhere to the principles set in the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Fiji and China , as well as its `` one China '' policy .
It also recognizes the government of the People 's Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing the whole China and it will not forge `` diplomatic '' ties with Taiwan .
