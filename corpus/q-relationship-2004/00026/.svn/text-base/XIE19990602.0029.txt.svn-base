MOSCOW , June 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Russian Mir Space Station 's crew will leave the orbiter in mid- August and switch it to automatic regime in anticipation for its eventual demise in the Earth 's atmosphere unless fresh capital is found to send new cosmonauts before early 2000 .
The decision was made Tuesday at a meeting of chief designers of the space industry , the Itar - Tass news agency reported , quoting Mikhail Sinelshchikov , head of the Russian Space Agency 's Department of Piloted Programs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Chances are slim , however , to find necessary funding for the dispatch of new crew , as the government 's provision of budget money will end in mid- August and repeated efforts to seek private capital have ended in vain .</ENAMEX>
The current crew of the Mir , which include Russians Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev and French Jean - Pierre Haignere , may be the last inhabitants of the Mir. A Progress cargo ship is expected to be sent to the 13-year -old space station in July to bring special equipment for the station 's remote control .
The crew will assemble the equipment in preparation for its unmanned functioning after August .
Prior to the crew 's departure , they will install a new computer allowing ground controllers to command the station without a crew on board .
Mir 's orbit , now about 240 miles above Earth , will gradually diminish .
At about 125 miles above the Earth , ground controllers will send a final command that will cause the station to burn up in the atmosphere , probably in February or March .
