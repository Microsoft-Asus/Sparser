WASHINGTON --
Government officials said Monday evening that the National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the FBI to take over the case of EgyptAir 990 , after a review of the plane 's cockpit voice recorder .
The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance , possibly a prayer , that they indicated might be the last words of a pilot determined to destroy himself and the airplane .
The plane crashed in the Atlantic , near Nantucket Island , R.I. , two weeks ago , killing all 217 people on board .
Officials would not characterize the words beyond saying that they may have been a prayer .
The crew 's conversations , other than uneventful ones with air traffic controllers , were in Arabic and senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of additional interpreters brought in Monday , they did not understand what was being said on the tape .
The problems were ones of language , culture and hearing what people said in a noisy cockpit .
Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yet synchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape , which would record events occurring on the airplane and could put the statements in context .
For instance , a prayer being said after the plane began plummeting so fast that passengers were rendered weightless would not be suspicious .
So a fuller understanding of the tape might make it clear that the crash was , in fact , an accident .
The safety board has supreme authority over transportation accidents , and guards that role jealously , but the FBI , which usually assists the board , takes over if the two agencies decide that there was evidence of a crime .
The chairman of the safety board , Jim Hall , at a news conference Monday afternoon , said , `` We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the evidence , including the cockpit voice recorder , whether or not this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the NTSB . ''
Asked to clarify why he was focusing on whether the crash was properly within his agency 's jurisdiction , Hall simply reread his statement about leadership of the investigation .
Government officials said that the safety board proposed stepping aside Monday afternoon , and taking a subordinate role assisting the FBI , but was dissuaded by the FBI from doing so .
The FBI , which had one agent sitting in with safety board officials on Sunday to listen to the tape , sent more Monday evening , officials said .
The board is often eager to extricate itself from crashes that are not caused by mechanical failures or human error ; most recently , it gave the FBI jurisdiction over the derailment of an Amtrak train in October 1995 , near Hyder , Ariz. , that was determined to have been caused by someone sabotaging the tracks .
It has also turned over two aircraft incidents , in which disgruntled airline employees came into the cockpit and attacked the pilots flying the plane .
And board officials say that they have a full agenda of work ahead of them without this crash , including the TWA 800 crash three years ago , which many initially suspected was sabotage .
In addition , they would not say how many voices were heard on the tape .
The cockpit requires a crew of two , and has two seats where observers , trainees or company employees along for the ride can sit .
The plane , a 10-year -old Boeing 767 , was cruising at 33,000 feet about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31 when the autopilot disengaged , either by itself or by the action of a pilot .
Then the plane flew steadily for a few more seconds , and went into an extremely steep dive .
During the dive , someone turned off the engines .
The dive was so steep that people inside were rendered weightless , but after descending about 3 miles , the plane pitched up again , subjecting everyone inside to two and a half times the normal force of gravity .
Then it turned downward again and apparently broke up .
Hall said Monday evening , `` I am well aware of the many rumors , theories , and stories circulating in the last 72 hours -- indeed , in the last two weeks -- about potential causes of this tragedy . ''
A U.S. intelligence official said Monday night that the CIA still has no evidence indicating terrorist activity in connection with the crash .
The official said that the CIA has translators listening to the tape , but CIA officials still are not certain of the significance of the utterances .
An American pilot with long experience in crash investigations run by the safety board suggested that the board 's next steps could include interviews and even cultural study , as opposed to technical analysis .
At the FBI , Joseph Valiquette , a spokesman for the New York office , said , `` as far as the FBI is concerned , we 're doing the same things today that we 've been doing for the past two weeks .
But we all agree -- FBI , NTSB an the rest of the parties -- that the tape recordings need to be further analyzed before people can reach certain conclusions . ''
Monday , FBI Director Louis Freeh met with Hall to discuss the progress of the case and the possibility that the bureau might take over the inquiry .
In part , senior officials are worried over how to pay for what could be a long and costly investigation , if it is necessary to retrieve large sections of the aircraft from the seabed .
Law -enforcement officials said the bureau might tap the government 's Counterterrorism Fund , a reserve of several million dollars that is managed by the Justice Department .
The fund is designed to pay for extraordinary expenses involved in terror cases , but only if the evidence suggests a criminal act .
