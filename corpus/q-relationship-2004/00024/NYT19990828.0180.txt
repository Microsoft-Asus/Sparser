ISTANBUL , Turkey --
When seismologists reviewed data from the devastating earthquake in Turkey , they made a remarkable discovery .
The force of the quake appears to have pushed Turkey about 4 feet closer to Europe .
Due to steady pressures beneath Turkish soil , the country had already been moving westward at a rate of about one-tenth of an inch per year .
The shock of the earthquake produced a sudden acceleration in that movement .
More significant , though , has been the fact that since the Aug. 17 quake , Turkey and Europe have moved closer not just geologically , but also politically and psychologically .
Almost every European country has rushed to send relief aid to Turkey .
The most recent was Sweden , which announced on Friday that it would contribute $ 4.8 million .
The European Union sent $ 3.8 million in emergency humanitarian aid last week and has announced that it will allocate another $ 41.8 million to build housing for survivors .
Private fund raising in Europe has also been remarkably successful .
A two-hour television appeal in Germany raised $ 7 million , and a similar campaign in the Netherlands produced $ 13 million .
Efforts are under way to convert this wave of sympathy into a permanent policy change that could help heal the breach between Turkey and Europe .
President Jacques Chirac of France has sent a letter to leaders of the other 14 member states of the European Union urging that the union take this opportunity to develop a `` new strategy '' for dealing with Turkey .
Responses in may capitals were favorable , suggesting that the 2-year -old freeze in dialogue between Turkey and Europe may soon end .
The freeze began after the European Union decided in December 1997 to exclude Turkey from the group of countries negotiating for European Union membership .
Although full membership for Turkey is still a distant prospect , the tone of statements from both sides has become much warmer since the quake .
Perhaps most significant has been the change in the attitude of Greece , which for years has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in European Union funds earmarked for Turkey .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Greece offered quick and generous aid to earthquake victims , and many ordinary Greeks joined government leaders in suggesting that this might be an ideal moment for the two historic rivals to move toward friendship</ENAMEX> .
`` I hope this disaster will mark the start of peaceful coexistence between our two nations , '' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos of Athens said during a visit to Istanbul this week .
`` Chasms opened by the earthquake can also lead to new roads . ''
A<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL"> visit by the mayor of Greece 's biggest city to Turkey 's biggest city would have been all but unthinkable before the earthquake .
It symbolized the sudden warming in ties between the two countries</ENAMEX> .
There are reports that Greece will make a more substantial gesture toward Turkey next month , when European Union foreign ministers meet in Helsinki .
Greek leaders are reportedly discussing either lifting their veto of European Union funds that have been earmarked for Turkey , or proposing a generous aid package for reconstruction in the earthquake zone .
`` We hope this tragedy can increase understanding between Turkey and the EU , and that some of the funds that have been held could be released , '' Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland , which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , said on Friday .
Among Turkish leaders who welcomed recent gestures from Greece was Mesut Yilmaz , who as prime minister in 1997 ordered the freeze on political dialogue with Europe .
He said he hoped the new warmth between the two countries would quickly be translated into `` general government policy . ''
`` Turkey and Greece will be neighbors forever , '' Yilmaz said in a televised interview .
`` There are no problems that cannot be solved , no fields than cannot be shared . ''
`` I believe solutions can be found to the Cyprus problem and the Aegean problem as long as the two sides do n't always try to get the upper hand , '' he said .
`` I see this as an improvement that is not temporary , but permanent . ''
Perhaps even more surprising than the welcome given to Greek relief workers here was the welcome given to three doctors from Cyprus .
The three had at first hesitated to leave Istanbul , fearing that as representatives of the pro- Greek government on Cyprus , they would be reviled and perhaps attacked .
But they put aside their fears , traveled to the earthquake zone , and later said they were overwhelmed by the kisses and embraces with which Turks greeted them .
Even Armenia , whose relations with Turkey have been even frostier than Greece 's , extended a hand of friendship after the earthquake .
After some hesitation in both countries , including a statement by Turkey 's right-wing minister of health that Turks should not accept aid from such a historic enemy , Armenia on Friday sent a plane load of aid .
Although neither Cyprus nor Armenia are members of the European Union , they have lobbied hard against Turkish efforts to win acceptance in Europe .
With the euphoria with which many Turks and Europeans are greeting news of their reconciliation , there have been some words of caution .
Issues that have divided the two sides for years , including European complaints about human-rights abuses in Turkey , have faded from the limelight but still have not been resolved .
Tunca Toskay , a minister without portfolio in the Turkish government , warned that Turkey would not accept aid from Europe if it is conditioned on changes in Turkish domestic policy .
`` We will break the half-loaves of bread that we have into fourths , and refuse that kind of aid , '' he asserted .
The next sign of Turkey 's new-found friendship with Europe may come on Thursday , when the Greek soccer team PAOK Salonika will face the Istanbul team Galatasaray in a hastily arranged match .
All profits are to be donated to an earthquake relief fund .
