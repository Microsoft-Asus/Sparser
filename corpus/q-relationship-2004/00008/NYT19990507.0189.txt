Every week or so for the last 52 weeks , there has been an anthrax bomb scare in the city of Los Angeles , California .
Fortunately , all of them have been false alarms .
Someday , one of them might not be .
In Tokyo , `` someday '' happened four years ago .
On March 20 , 1995 , the Aum Shinrikyo cult , which no intelligence agency in the western world had ever heard of , launched a Sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway system .
Twelve people were killed and more than 5,000 were injured .
Had the cult 's technology been more sophisticated , the toll in human life would have been catastrophic .
Since then , the science behind bio-weaponry has advanced dramatically .
Genetic researchers now believe that within the next decade technology will exist to create biological weapons that can kill certain ethnic groups while leaving others unharmed .
Specifically , they believe it will be possible to develop `` targeted '' anthrax that kills ethnic Albanians , but not Serbs ; Jews but not Arabs ; Greeks but not Turks .
The possibility of this kind of genetic warfare is terrifying .
The weaponry is tasteless , odorless and could be shipped into any country at any time in component parts .
What once might have been a bad script for a James Bond movie is now an acute national security and public health issue .
`` We live in a time when bio-terrorism is a real concern , `` one senior Clinton Administration national security official told Science magazine in its April 30 issue .
That concern is causing scientists and policy-makers around the world to finally speak out on the issue .
On January 21 , the British Medical Association released a report called `` Biotechnology , Weapons and Humanity . ''
The report warned that genetic research could be perverted to develop `` weapons which may become a major threat to existence of Homo sapiens . ''
Dr. Vivienne Nathanson , who heads up health policy for the BMA , said of her organization 's inquiry : `` We went into this being very skeptical , with a position that ` It ca n't be done . '
But then after examining what is going on we decided that it might be possible after all .
It would be a tragedy if in 10 years time the world faces the reality of genetically engineered and possibly genetically targeted weapons . ''
Craig Venter , co-founder of Celera Genomics Corporation and an adviser to President Clinton on the threat of genetically engineered weaponry , shares Dr. Nathanson 's view .
In a speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in January , Venter said that cracking the genetic code of every bacteria and virus was no longer just a biomedical inquiry , but a national security imperative as well .
Genomics research , Venter argued , was the only viable deterrent against attacks on the United States by `` extremists '' or rogue states armed with bio-weapons .
Last month , President Clinton signed a national security memorandum calling for the preservation of variola -LRB- smallpox virus -RRB- in top-security laboratories .
He did so at the urging of Joshua Lederberg , president emeritus of Rockefeller University .
Faced with the choice of eradicating smallpox forever or keeping it for research purposes , Lederberg argued successfully that the threat of bio-terrorism required the US to keep the pathogen on hand .
Targeted bio-weaponry is not new .
As the British journalist Gwynne Dyer reported recently in the Sacramento Bee , `` The apartheid regime did a lot of work on bacteria that would attack only blacks ?
Iraq has a big germ warfare program . ''
And there are detailed US intelligence reports that show the former Soviet Union made a major effort to `` weaponize '' the lethal smallpox virus .
But the old bio-weaponry is Cocoa Puffs compared to what will soon be possible .
The political and national security leadership of the US government needs to present a detailed account of where we stand in our preparations for the coming war against bio-terrorism .
President Clinton addressed this issue briefly in a speech at the US Naval Academy a year ago , but he was not -LRB- purposely -RRB- specific .
The country now needs to know the specifics , so that we can make informed judgements on how best to proceed .
There are things that can be done .
At the moment , the US government is the major source of funds for $ 3 billion Human Genome Project .
The US might double the funding for this research and , if need be , triple it .
We need to know the exact cause of anthrax 's toxicity .
We need to know the antidotes for other pathogens .
Genomics is to the next era of warfare what nuclear fission was to the post- World War II era .
The Human Genome Project is the Manhattan Project of our time .
Speeding up its progress may save thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives down the road .
Throwing money at it would be wise public policy .
