Wang Shuwen , vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National People 's Congress , said that the Garrison Law says that troops stationed in the Hong Kong SAR must abide by national laws and the laws of the Hong Kong SAR .
In the process of drawing up the law , the troops ' duties , their relationship with the SAR government , and jurisdiction over military personnel were considered extensively , Wang said .
He said the troops stationed in the Hong Kong SAR are to help maintain state sovereignty , national unity , territorial integrity , and Hong Kong 's security , and they must respect Hong Kong 's social system , Hong Kong people 's lifestyle , and power organs of the Hong Kong SAR .
This is very important for their carrying on the fine traditions of the PLA and for getting along with the people of Hong Kong , he explained .
As for their relationship with the SAR government , he said the garrison law stresses that they cannot interfere in local affairs , but that the Hong Kong SAR government will support the troops doing their duties .
The Garrison Law clearly explains jurisdiction over military personnel , he said .
The military judicial authorities on the mainland will be in charge of criminal cases involving military personnel on duty , while the Hong Kong SAR courts will have jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel off duty .
In this way , the autonomy and jurisdiction of Hong Kong are fully respected , and the legitimate rights of Hong Kong residents are protected .
