Retroviruses (such as HIV) are RNA viruses that use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA from their RNA template. The DNA can then integrate into the host genome as a provirus. Vaccines against specific viruses stimulate the immune system to defend the host against an infection. Emerging viruses that cause new outbreaks of disease are usually existing viruses that manage to expand their host territory. Tumor viruses insert viral DNA into host cell DNA, triggering cancerous changes through their own or host cell oncogenes.</p><a name="para29"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity18D:<span class="Emphasis1">

In transformation, naked DNA enters the cell from the surroundings. In transduction, bacterial DNA is carried from one cell to another by phages. In conjugation, an F factor-containing "male" cell transfers DNA to an F<SUP>-</SUP> cell. F<SUP>+</SUP> cells transfer only the F plasmid. The F factor of an Hfr cell, which is integrated into the bacterial chromosome, brings some chromosomal DNA along with it when it transfers to an F<SUP>-</SUP> cell. R plasmids confer resistance to various antibiotics. Their transfer between bacterial cells poses medical problems. Transposons, DNA segments that can insert at multiple sites in a cell’s DNA, also contribute to genetic shuffling in bacteria (and eukaryotes). Insertion sequences, the simplest bacterial transposons, can affect gene function as they move about. They consist of inverted repeats of DNA flanking a gene for transposase. Composite transposons have additional genes, such as those for antibiotic resistance.</p><a name="para37"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in the Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">

In bacteria, coordinately regulated genes are often clustered into operons, with one promoter serving several adjacent genes. An operator site on the DNA switches the operon on or off. In a repressible operon, binding of a specific repressor protein to the operator shuts off transcription by blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase. The repressor is activated by binding a small corepressor molecule, usually the end product of an anabolic pathway. In an inducible operon, an innately active repressor is inactivated by binding an inducer, thereby turning on the genes of the operon only when necessary. Inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways. Operons can also be subject to positive control via a stimulatory activator protein. For example, the active form of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) stimulates transcription by binding to a site next to the promoter and enhancing its ability to bind RNA polymerase.</p><a name="para39"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 18E: <span class="Emphasis1">
