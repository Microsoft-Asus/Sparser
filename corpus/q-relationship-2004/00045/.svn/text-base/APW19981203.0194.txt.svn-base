Eighteen international crime organizations are operating in Canada , the national Security Intelligence Service warns .
These organizations include various Mafia groups , Russian and Eastern European mobs , Japanese yakuza , Asian triads , Colombian drug cartels , Jamaican posses , and Nigerian gangs , CSIS said in a report released Wednesday .
They are active in insurance fraud , environmental crime , migrant smuggling , bank fraud and corruption , said the report which outlined a role for CSIS in fighting crime .
The gangs , which often use a legitimate business as a front , never hesitate to use violence or murder .
Using a United Nations formula , the report estimates that in 1995 international crime-related losses to the domestic economy would have been about U.S. dlrs 9.2 billion .
The CSIS is not a police agency .
It is primarily a spy-catching and counterterrorism service .
