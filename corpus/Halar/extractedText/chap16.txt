Chapter 16: THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

DNA AS THE GENETIC MATERIAL

   The search for the genetic material led to DNA

   Watson and Crick discovered the double helix by building models to conform to X-ray data



DNA REPLICATION AND REPAIR

   During DNA replication, base pairing enables existing DNA strands to serve as templates for new complementary strands

   A large team of enzymes and other proteins carries out DNA replication

   Enzymes proofread DNA during its replication and repair damage in existing DNA

   The ends of DNA molecules are replicated by a special mechanism

In April 1963, James Watson and Francis Crick shook the scientific world with an elegant double-helical model for the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photograph on this page captures Watson and Crick admiring their DNA model. DNA, the substance of inheritance, is the most celebrated molecule of our time. Mendel's heritable factors and Morgan's genes on chromosomes are, in fact, composed of DNA. Chemically speaking, your genetic endowment is the DNA you inherited from your parents.

Of all nature's molecules, nucleic acids are unique in their ability to direct their own replication. Indeed, the resemblance of offspring to their parents has its basis in the precise replication of DNA and its transmission from one generation to the next. In other words, DNA is the substance behind the adage "Like begets like." Hereditary information is encoded in the chemical language of DNA and reproduced in all the cells of your body. It is this DNA program that directs the development of your biochemical, anatomical, physiological, and, to some extent, behavioral traits. In this chapter, you will learn how biologists deduced that DNA is the genetic material, how Watson and Crick discovered its structure, and how cells replicate and repair their DNA--the molecular basis of inheritance.
