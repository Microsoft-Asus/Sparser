AMMAN , Jordan --
This is a difficult time for illness to afflict the only king that most Jordanians have ever known .
Last month , King Hussein , sovereign of this land for 45 years , announced to his people that he was going to the hospital for tests , much like a father would with his family .
Last week , he confirmed that he had lymphatic cancer , though it was apparently caught early and he vowed to live through it .
Televised from his hospital at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , the 62-year -old monarch spoke of upcoming months of chemotherapy and said , `` There is life and there is an end to life , this is the way with everyone .
But rest assured , I am not over and done with . ''
Hussein has been sick before , having cancer removed from his kidney in 1992 .
But now , his subjects are worried not only about him , but also about the future of their little desert country , which sits among so many threatening neighbors .
`` It has affected me more than if it were a member of my own family , '' said Jordanian carpenter Atef Beni , 33 .
`` He is the protector of this country .
We all live under him . ''
Under other circumstances , Jordanians might offer cautious criticism of the King about the country 's recession , his unpopular peace with Israel and his human rights abuses .
But Jordanians , as well as foreigners , see him also as the only one who can fix these problems , recognizing that he is an essential buffer between forces that could unsettle Jordan and the region .
`` We will be in stagnation waiting for him , '' said Taher Masri , a former Jordanian prime minister who seeks the office again .
`` -LRB- People -RRB- may criticize him perhaps , but when it comes to our feelings for him , he is a savior .
No doubt about it . ''
A descendant of the Muslim prophet Mohammed , Hussein is from a Saudi family installed by western forces after World War I. He has been a neutral broker between Bedouins , indigenous Jordanians and Palestinians , the latter of whom now make up about 60 percent of Jordan 's 4.4 million population .
Regionally , Hussein opened relations with Israel on the west , which most Jordanians see as a belligerent neighbor .
Meanwhile , he has held off , while maintaining ties with , Iraq 's expansionist Saddam Hussein on the east and Syria 's Hafez Asad to the north .
King Hussein has crushed bread riots of his own people and fought a bloody , though short , war against Yasser Arafat 's PLO when it tried to exert too much power from its base in his country .
Someday , he will almost certainly be replaced by Crown Prince Hassan , the King 's brother , who is 12 years younger and has been the named successor for more than 30 years .
Hassan , educated at Oxford , is considered a competent intellectual who , according to a Western diplomat , has `` velcro-ed himself '' to the King 's policies .
But it is the King who has the charm .
He became king at just 18 years of age .
Now , in his early 60s , Hussein is seen as the patient man who gave a palace up to orphans and visited grieving Israelis after their children were killed by a crazed Jordanian soldier .
The fact that he sometimes flies his own plane and that his fourth wife , Queen Noor , is an Arab - American educated at Princeton , add to a carefully-crafted mystique that have raised his country 's profile with his own .

Now , though , Jordan faces serious internal problems , aggravated by what had been high expectations for the 1990s .
Always a poor country with few resources , Jordan 's economy is worsening .
Unemployment hovers over 20 percent and a third of the country lives in poverty .
Hussein 's boldest venture , the 1994 peace treaty with Israel , is largely seen as a failure .
Israeli troops still occupy most of the land in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank sought by Palestinians , many of whom have close relatives of Palestinians in Jordan .
Last year , Israelis humiliated and infuriated the King when they tried to assassinate a Hamas terrorist , respected by many Jordanians , on the streets of the capital .
Contrary to hopes for democracy , people are restless under Hussein 's bans on public demonstration and tough rules against press freedom .
Hussein , an avid reader of medical journals even before his illnesses , has been more candid about them than many Western leaders .
He has also talked about the inevitability of death , almost a taboo subject in a culture where most people do not even make wills .
This prompts assurances that Crown Prince Hassan will rule much like the King , maintaining the unpopular peace process with Israel and perhaps being more adept at handling the economy .
Unclear still , is who would come after Hassan .
Observers say the royal family may be split between two 18-year -old princes -- Hassan 's son Rashed or Hussein 's and Queen Noor 's son Hamzah .
Hussein may have been giving the edge to his son recently .
He welcomed Hamzah to manhood with a letter , published prominently in the semi-official press , stating that Hamzah had now reached the age he was when he became king .
