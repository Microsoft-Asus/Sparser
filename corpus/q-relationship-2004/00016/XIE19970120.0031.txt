JOHANNESBURG , January 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The South African government favors the proposed 638-million- U.S. - Dollar South African - Syrian arms deal in principle but the deal is still at a tentative stage , Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today .
South Africa 's armaments company Denel is just one of companies around the world which has responded to a Syrian request for tank firing control systems , Mbeki said after attending a close-door meeting of the African National Congress -LRB- ANC -RRB- .
He noted that some European and U.S. companies have also expressed interest in supplying such technologies to Syria .
Mbeki said the South African government has a clear policy on the sale of arms abroad and the proposed supply of arms to Syria falls within the ambit of this policy .
South Africa 's criteria on arms sale include the human rights record of the country concerned , the likelihood that the weaponry would be used to suppress the local people and whether or not a united nations arms embargo is in force , he noted .
Mbeki said the decision has to be viewed in accordance with the policy of the present South African government which has relations with most of the countries in the Middle East rather than only with Israel , as was the case with the previous government .
Earlier today , Foreign Ministry spokesman Pieter Swanepoel told the press that neither his ministry nor Denel had any doubt that the deal is still at the bidding stage .
Swanepoel said when the contractual stage is reached which is only likely in about two years time , it would be necessary to review the situation in the Middle East and decide whether South Africa -made tank firing control system should be supplied .
The local Sunday Times paper quoted some leaked cabinet minutes as saying that the cabinet has conditionally approved the signing of a pending contract to deliver the package of arms to Syria .
