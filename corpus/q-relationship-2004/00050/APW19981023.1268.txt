___ SAO PAULO , Brazil -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Brazilian airlines will ban smoking on all national and international flights effective Friday , the Department of Civil Aviation announced .
The ban was the result of a federal court order issued Thursday in the southern city of Porto Alegre by judge Guilherme Pinho Machado .
The judge said the aim was `` to safeguard the health of non-smokers . ''
Until Friday , smokers were allowed to light up one hour after takeoff in areas that were `` isolated and properly ventilated . ''
But the department reversed itself , saying most airplanes do not have such conditions .
`` Planes are not equipped with any physical barriers , separating smokers from non-smokers , '' Machado said .

___ BOGOTA , Colombia -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Colombian police arrested a man police described as a major figure in the reborn Cali cocaine cartel on Friday .
Edgar de Jesus Fernandez was seized in an apartment in Medellin , once the rival city of the Cali drug cartel , police said .
They said Fernandez is among a group of lower-profile drug lords , many of them former mid-level traffickers , who assumed the business after top Cali bosses Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela were jailed in 1995 .
Police also said Fernandez was wanted for extradition by the United States .
U.S. embassy and Colombian Foreign Ministry officials contacted by The Associated Press said they were unaware of any such request .
The newer generation of Cali drug traffickers are less notorious and violent than the drug cartels that once terrorized Colombia .
But the flow of drugs to the United States has remained steady at about 700 tons of cocaine a year , authorities say .
Colombia currently produces more than 80 percent of the cocaine and much of the heroin sold on U.S. streets .
