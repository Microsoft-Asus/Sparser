AMMAN , Jordan --
In a powerful show of U.S. support for this strategic desert nation , President Clinton and his three predecessors bowed their heads Monday in tribute to King Hussein and bid farewell to a partner in peace .
Hussein , who died Sunday at 63 from cancer , was laid to rest according to Muslim traditions , his body wrapped in a white shroud and gently lowered into a grave by his loyal Bedouin guards .
Cannon fire echoed throughout this mourning city and fighter jets flew overhead in dramatic salute .
After a brief meeting , Clinton praised King Abdullah , the 37-year -old new monarch whose youth and inexperience raised questions about his ability to rule Jordan and to maintain its path of moderation amid the extremes of the Middle East .
Hussein 's death leaves a void in the region 's peace process .
The king helped encourage the beginning of the process in 1991 , signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 , and left his sickbed to help salvage talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority last October .
`` He clearly understands his mission , '' Clinton said of King Abdullah during an address to U.S. Embassy workers here .
`` He said in the most moving way , ` I and all of my brothers and sisters have absorbed our father 's teaching , we know what we are supposed to do and I intend to do it . '
And he said it in a way that exuded the quiet , humble confidence that I saw so often in his father , '' Clinton said .
Less than two weeks ago , Hussein dumped his brother Hassan as crown prince and announced the surprise decision to name Abdullah , the king 's oldest son , as heir .
Hassan had served as heir for much of Hussein 's 47-year reign .
Sandy Berger , Clinton 's national security adviser , said the president and the new king discussed the importance of reassuring Israel of Jordan 's commitment to peace .
Berger said that Clinton , in discussions with other world leaders , also urged them to continue their support of Jordan .
The United States also is urging other nations to restructure some of Jordan 's debt .
The administration previously announced it would seek an additional $ 300 million in aide over three years to help this country 's economy .
`` Jordan 's biggest problem right now is an economy that is not strong and needs to grow , '' Berger said .
Clinton sent an unmistakable signal of the United States ' support for Jordan and King Abdullah , and its respect for Hussein , by including former Presidents Bush , Carter and Ford in his delegation .
Carter and Bush , who also addressed the Embassy personnel , added their praise for King Abdullah .
Carter recalled that King Hussein asked if his son could attend high-level sessions at the White House when the boy was 12 .
`` So I feel that he 's well-qualified to lead this great nation and these great people , '' Carter said .
Added Bush , `` I share President Carter 's confidence in the future of Jordan under your new king .
He 'll do just fine . ''
Bush , however , did not mention the falling out he had with Hussein over Jordan 's initial support of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
Clinton hailed Hussein 's ability to bring people together .
`` We know that America 's interest and America 's heart were close to this king and this country , '' he said .
Amman was a city in mourning as scraps of black cloth clung to car antennas , clothes and buildings .
A military escort provided the king 's funeral cortege a last trip around the city of seven hills .
But hundreds of mourners overwhelmed the motorcade , tossing flowers atop the casket and separating the jeep carrying the king 's body from its guards before the motorcade entered Raghadon Palace .
The coffin lay in state in the Throne Room , where all windows face east toward Mecca .
There , scores of world leaders -- kings and queens , presidents and prime ministers -- passed by , some offering a salute , some offering a prayer .
Among the mourners was Hussein 's sometime nemesis , Syrian President Hafez Assad , who opened his palms in traditional Islamic prayer and rubbed his hands down his face in a sign of sorrow .
Assad 's delegation was kept at a diplomatic distance from a large Israeli delegation that included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several candidates seeking his position in the May elections .
It was the first time Assad and Israeli leaders have ever been at the same location .
Iraq and Libya also sent delegations .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin , appearing bloated and unsteady , needed aides to help him up the palace stairs .
He stayed only briefly , and , apparently ailing , left the palace immediately to return to Moscow .
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat also offered two salutes to Hussein , who played an instrumental role in helping initiate Middle East peace talks in 1991 .
Secretary of State Madeline Albright stayed in Washington in deference to Muslim tradition that prohibits women from attending funeral services .
Clinton , Bush , Carter and Ford provided a dramatic moment as they walked in together , turned toward the coffin and dropped their heads in prayer .
The gathering also provided Clinton with an opportunity to speak briefly to several heads of state as he awaited his turn , aides said .
The world leaders joined the family members for the short walk from the palace to the burial site .
A drum and bagpipe band , a throwback to Jordan 's days under British rule , lead the way .
A white Arabian stallion , boots turned backward in the stirrups to symbolize a fallen rider , pranced along the route .
Only the king 's sons and brothers were allowed at the gravesite .
King Abdullah , his head wrapped in the traditional red Bedouin kaffiyeh , accepted the folded flag from the Hussein coffin .
Queen Noor , Hussein 's U.S. -born wife , remained secluded at the palace where , by tradition , she could not attend the funeral services .
The spouses of other world leaders , including first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , met separately with her to offer their support and condolences .
The grief-stricken queen , dressed in white for mourning , was seen earlier in the day clutching one of her daughters in a doorway as the king 's cortege left the palace grounds for the parade around the city .
After the ceremony , she left the palace , offering a comforting kiss to her youngest daughter who was frightened by camera flashes .
Queen Noor 's parents traveled aboard Air Force One with Clinton to attend the ceremony .
