									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">A plant biologist observed a peculiar pattern when a tropical shrub was attacked by caterpillars. The scientist noticed that after a caterpillar ate a leaf, it would skip over nearby leaves and attack a leaf some distance away. The researcher found that when a leaf was eaten, nearby leaves started making a chemical that deterred the caterpillars. Simply removing a leaf did not deter the caterpillars from eating nearby leaves. The biologist suspected that a damaged leaf sent out a chemical that signaled other leaves. How could the researcher test this hypothesis?</p>
