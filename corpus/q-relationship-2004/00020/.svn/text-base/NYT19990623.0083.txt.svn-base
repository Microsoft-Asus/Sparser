-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- To restore strategic balance to South Asia , Pakistan was obliged to respond to India 's May 1998 nuclear blasts .
India already held an advantage in conventional weaponry , and was following its underground tests with statements threatening nuclear blackmail .
Pakistan 's nuclear tests were undertaken in self-defense .
By establishing mutual deterrence , they have served the interests of peace and stability in South Asia .
Pakistan is acutely aware of the risks and responsibilities accompanying nuclear weapons .
In 1974 Pakistan responded to India 's nuclear test with redoubled efforts to keep the region nuclear-free , realizing that a nuclear race in South Asia would have far-reaching consequences .
At that time , Pakistan proposed a nuclear weapons-free zone in South Asia ; a joint renunciation of acquisition or manufacture of nuclear weapons ; mutual inspection of nuclear facilities ; adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on nuclear facilities ; a bilateral nuclear test ban ; and a missile-free zone in South Asia .
In June 1991 Pakistan proposed a five-nation conference , which was later expanded to include all permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , to discuss conventional arms control and confidence-building measures as well as the promotion of nuclear restraint .
In 1997 , before the U.N. General Assembly , the prime minister of Pakistan again proposed mutual and equal restraint by Pakistan and India on the development of nuclear and ballistic missiles .
These initiatives not only remained unanswered by India but elicited little support from the international community .
With 16 tests of the Prithvi design and four of the Agni -- both of them nuclear-capable and targeted at Pakistan 's cities -- India accelerated the pace of its missile programs .
Prithvi missiles were inducted into India 's armed forces and deployed against Pakistan , forcing Pakistan to develop an indigenous missile capability , since its zero-missile-zone proposal had been rendered redundant .
What finally compelled Pakistan to orient its nuclear program for defense was the absence of security ; the country needed an indigenous defense capability .
Past sanctions degraded Pakistan 's conventional capabilities to the point that it was inconceivable they would counter an Indian nuclear threat .
Yet it remains in both sides ' fundamental interest to avert a nuclear arms race .
It is imperative to move swiftly toward a strategic-restraint regime , with nuclear and conventional stabilization measures .
With this perspective , Pakistan has resumed its dialogue with India , focusing on peace , security , confidence-building and the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir issue .
The framework for discussions , which Pakistan has formally proposed , includes measures to prevent a nuclear and ballistic-missile race , risk-reduction mechanisms , the non-induction of anti-ballistic missile and sea-launched ballistic missile systems and the maintenance of nuclear deterrence at the minimum level .
Pakistan has also proposed a mutual and balanced reduction of conventional forces .
In February 1999 , at Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 's invitation , Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Lahore .
They issued a joint declaration committing both sides to a peaceful resolution of outstanding issues including Kashmir and decided to work for conclusive measures in nuclear and conventional arms control , build mutual confidence and avoid the risks of conflict .
The Lahore declaration signifies Pakistan 's and India 's desire to manage the nuclear standoff in South Asia in a responsible and mature manner .
Indeed the costs of seeking unilateral advantage have become prohibitive .
Pakistan and India must conduct their relations on the basis of sovereign equality , endeavor to settle the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and build a more secure and prosperous future for their peoples .
Pakistan has declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing and offered a regional test-ban treaty to India .
It has agreed in good faith to join the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a fissile material treaty , solemnly reiterated its promise not to transfer sensitive equipment or technology , and declared its commitment to build a mutually acceptable and verifiable strategic-restraint regime with India .
Pakistan has also indicated its readiness to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in conditions free of coercion or pressure .
The CTBT 's entry into force requires the adherence of all the 44 designated states , including all nuclear weapons states , whether or not they are recognized as such .
This is a cardinal element in establishing a norm against explosive testing .
The CTBT would , unfortunately , not be a nuclear disarmament measure .
Technologically advanced states would continue to develop and improve weapons designs through subcritical or nondetectable tests .
A nuclear conflict can have no victor .
In South Asia , nuclear deterrence may , however , usher in an era of durable peace between Pakistan and India and provide the requisite incentives to resolve all outstanding issues , especially Jammu and Kashmir .
The international community should encourage a process of peace and rapprochement , help promote the peaceful resolution of disputes and support nuclear stabilization and restraint in South Asia .
The world must also pay attention to the root causes of insecurity and instability in South Asia .
Resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is indispensable for the region 's peace and prosperity .
The principles for a just settlement of this dispute have been enunciated in U.N. Security Council resolutions , which must be implemented .
The U.S. - Pakistani dialogue on security and nuclear issues has also progressed .
The United States has adopted a pragmatic approach , recognizing the steps that Pakistan has taken for peace and global nonproliferation .
The United States must continue to play an important role in transforming South Asia 's security environment from confrontation to cooperation .
Economic sanctions and coercive measures against Pakistan will serve neither peace nor nonproliferation .
These sanctions and pressures are unjust and unwarranted .
Pakistan has not violated any legal obligations or international norms .
Sanctions must be lifted .
The nuclearization of South Asia is a reality .
But all South Asian states remain committed to the goals of global nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation .
As members of the Nonaligned Movement , Pakistan and India have always stood for a principled and nondiscriminatory attainment of these goals .
Both should cooperate with the international community to promote peace , security , disarmament and nonproliferation .
