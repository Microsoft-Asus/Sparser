THE ORIGIN OF VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors



 

 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago



You learned earlier in the chapter that modern vascular plants include the ferns and related plants (pteridophytes), gymnosperms, and flowering plants (angiosperms). And recall that vascular plants are equipped with food-transporting phloem as well as water-conducting xylem tissue with lignified cells. Vascular plants also differ from bryophytes in having a dominant sporophyte generation and branched sporophytes that become independent of parental gametophytes. Pteridophytes are described as seedless vascular plants because, unlike gymnosperms and angiosperms, they do not produce seeds. The first vascular plants were seedless (see FIGURE 29.1).
