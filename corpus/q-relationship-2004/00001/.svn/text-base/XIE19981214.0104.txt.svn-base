LAGOS , December 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has urged the United Nations to reflect the global demand for democracy in the composition and structure of its Security Council .
Speaking at the 1998 annual dinner of the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs in capital Abuja Saturday night , Abubakar said that the Security Council is charged primarily with the responsibility for maintaining global peace and security , This Day reported Monday .
So , he noted , `` We have on many occasions drawn attention to the geo-political imbalance in the composition , decision-making process and working methods of U.N. organs and agencies . ''
Abubakar stated that it would be wrong and tantamount to self-deceit for the U.N. to preach the gospel of equity and democratization to its members while at the same time living under the illusion that `` genuine democratization of the U.N. system itself is a non-issue '' .
He stressed the expectation that the U.N. Security Council will continue to play its vital charter role , adding `` We are equally firm in our conviction that Africa requires stronger representation in this important body . ''
Any further delay in democratizing the U.N. system , can only give the unfortunate impression that the world organization functions only as an instrument for the pursuit of the interests of the great powers in particular , and the developed countries in general , he added .
