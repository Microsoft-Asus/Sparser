CARACAS , August 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel discarded Tuesday that President Hugo Chavez 's visit to Iraq may provoke the United States to impose sanctions .
He said there was no possibility that Venezuela may be sanctioned because Chavez 's visit to Iraq was part of his tour of all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- .
The minister said the United Nations has confirmed that Chavez ' s visit to Iraq does not violate any restrictions established by the international body .
Furthermore , he said , neither Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia opposes the Venezuelan leader 's presence in Iraq because they know Iraq is an OPEC member .
Chavez 's tour of OPEC nations is designed to invite their leaders to attend the organization 's summit meeting to be held in Caracas at the end of September this year .
