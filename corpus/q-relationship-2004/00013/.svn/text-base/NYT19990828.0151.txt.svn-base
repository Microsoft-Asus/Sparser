WASHINGTON --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">After years of warnings and efforts to correct the problem , the Defense Department 's computer systems remain disturbingly open to infiltration , according to a review by the General Accounting Office .
`` Serious weaknesses in Department of Defense information security continue to provide both hackers and hundreds of thousands of authorized users the opportunity to modify , steal , inappropriately disclose , and destroy sensitive DOD data , '' said the report , which was released on Thursday .</ENAMEX>
`` As a result , '' the report said , `` numerous Defense functions , including weapons and supercomputer research , logistics , finance , procurement , personnel management , military health , and payroll , have already been adversely affected by system attacks or fraud . ''
Robert F. Dacey , the director of computer security issues for the General Accounting Office , said the agency had warned of the problems several times in recent years .
Concerns about the security of federal computer systems were heightened this spring , when hackers broke into the Web sites of the White House , the FBI and the Senate , posting inappropriate photos and text and leading the government to shut down the sites temporarily .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Defense Department has persistent problems with computer security , said the accounting office , the investigative arm of Congress .</ENAMEX>
The Defense Department 's Information Systems Agency , which operates data-processing systems around the country , is the only unit that has begun a comprehensive security review .
In January 1998 , the Pentagon announced that it intended to consolidate its security efforts departmentwide .
But the program has still not been fully developed .
Last December , the department set up a task force to attack part of the security problem , monitoring computer networks and defending against hacker attacks .
Despite those efforts , the General Accounting Office found a number of security flaws .
For example , management of passwords on Defense Department computer systems had improved , but users were not required to change their passwords often enough , if at all .
Computer users often had easily guessed passwords .
And a single password was sometimes used by a group of people .
The report also found that some personnel had enough programming and security clearance to change programs or data -- for example , adding unauthorized paychecks -- and then cover their tracks .
Defense Department officials generally agreed with the findings .
Susan Hansen , a spokeswoman for the Department of Defense , said the Pentagon was `` working to shore up computer security as fast as time and resources will allow . ''
But the Defense Department has more computer users than any other organization in the world , she said .
The department has 2.1 million computers , with more than 10,000 networks linking computers both in the Pentagon and around the world .
