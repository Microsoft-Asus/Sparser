`` My understanding of the situation is that it has to do with a domestic criminal investigation , not necessarily connected to the kind of international terrorism that we 've spent a good bit of time engaging both with Pakistan and a number of other countries on , '' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said .
Pakistan and Jordan said last week that they had arrested 14 people , suspected of belonging to a ring loyal to Afghan -based Saudi exile Osama bin Laden .
Washington issued a worldwide warning following the arrests that Americans abroad must take extra care for the risk of possible terrorist attacks .
U.S. officials said arrests in Pakistan , which reports said amounted to 200 or so , may have been related to the killing of a senior Pakistani finance ministry official but gave no further details .
