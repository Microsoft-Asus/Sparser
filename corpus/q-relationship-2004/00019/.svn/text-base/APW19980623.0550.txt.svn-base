-LRB- AP -RRB- --
For the second time in a week , the German federal prosecutor on Tuesday reported the arrest of a suspected Turkish terrorist for alleged blackmail , murder and attempted murder .
A federal prosecutor 's statement identified the suspect only as 32-year -old Ilhan Y. , who it said was a leading member of the Revolutionary People 's Liberation Front , known as the Karatas wing of the leftist extremist group Devrimci Sol that split into rival groups in 1993 .
The other group is known as the Yagan wing , the statement said .
Prosecutors say that leaders of the Karatas wing ordered members to attack and sometimes kill members of the rival gang and Turks unwilling to contribute money .
They also blame the group for arson attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany , home to some 2 million Turks .
The statement said that Ilhan Y. , along with a Karatas functionary identified only as Turan , were responsible for the group 's actions in the Hamburg region .
He was arrested in the port city on June 23 and remains in investigative custody .
Ilhan Y. , along with other associates , allegedly beat up two employees of a Turkish restaurant in Hamburg and demolished the furnishings on April 25 , 1997 because the owner refused to pay money to the group .
When the owner returned with his car , Ilhan Y. used a pistol to shoot and kill a passenger riding with him , the statement said .
Turan , who was arrested in Hamburg on Sept. 9 , 1997 , already faces attempted murder charges in the Hamburg high state court for allegedly shooting and seriously wounding a member of the rival Yagan wing in the port city four days earlier .
Also charged in the attempted murder case are Serefettin G. , who heads the Karatas in Germany , and a Frankfurt area group leader Erdogan C. , the statement said .
A week ago the federal prosecutors office said an alleged member , identified only as 26-year -old Ali U. , was arrested on May 1 in Dortmund for the beating and attempted blackmail of a Turkish restaurant owner in the Ruhr river valley area .
Devrimci Sol and its successor Karatas wing claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks and murders in Turkey , with the aim of overthrowing the government to replace it with a Marxist regime .
