VIENNA , Austria --
After two days of disputes , OPEC decided Wednesday to increase oil production without the participation of its second-largest producer , Iran .
But the increase was not what the United States had pressed for , and was not expected to bring down gasoline prices any time soon .
In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its members would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a day , despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase .
The higher production would begin next month .
With Iran , the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels , but analysts said the actual increase would end up at the higher level because other OPEC members were likely to seize the opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran .
The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices , which have soared to more than $ 1.60 a gallon in most cities .
Iran 's irritation at the American pressures was apparently a major reason behind its opposition to any increase .
Experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks before any increase in oil production found its way to the gasoline pumps , and with inventories already unusually low in the United States as the summer driving season approaches , gasoline prices are not expected to decline soon .
In fact , some analysts predicted , they would rise still more before easing by fall .
`` Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $ 1 or $ 1.20 a gallon will be seriously disappointed , '' said Raad Alkadiri , an analyst at Petroleum Finance Co. , an industry research firm based in Washington .
`` Whatever happens , you 're going to have a tight gasoline market this summer . ''
The Clinton administration , however , was more optimistic and said that several other oil-producing nations that do not belong to OPEC would also increase output .
`` I think our quiet diplomacy worked , '' said Bill Richardson , the energy secretary , at a White House briefing on Tuesday evening .
Richardson said that when all sources of production were taken into account , `` we will be well above our objective . ''
He and other officials pointed out that prices were already down , to about $ 27 a barrel from a high of $ 34 a barrel , in anticipation of more production .
In New York trading on Tuesday , crude oil for May delivery fell 70 cents , to $ 27.09 a barrel .
The unusual break in OPEC 's ranks came after two days of wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia , the largest producer , which pushed for an increase in production .
In the end , OPEC announced that nine of its 11 members would go ahead and increase their quotas .
The production of Iraq , which says it now produces 2.4 million barrels a day , has been separately governed by U.N. resolutions since the 1991 Persian Gulf war .
Iraq said Tuesday night that it planned to significantly increase its production by the end of the year , but experts were skeptical .
The fissure with Iran has major implications for the United States .
Indeed , the battle within OPEC was as much political as economic , and much of the debate was over whether the group would be capitulating to pressure from the United States for lower oil prices .

Wednesday 's split could damage OPEC 's discipline and credibility , just as the organization seemed to have regained some of the power it had in the 1970s and early 1980s .
Iran 's oil minister , Bijan Namdar Zangeneh , accused the other OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not justified by economic conditions .
`` OPEC is not an organization to rubber-stamp the decisions already made , '' Zangeneh said in a short but biting statement about 1 a.m. Wednesday .
`` We tried to show our flexibility , '' he continued .
`` OPEC needs a spirit of compromise , which unfortunately we did n't trace at this time . ''
If OPEC 's discipline does come unhinged , the United States could be a major beneficiary and see its bill for imported oil drop .
In the past , when OPEC failed to agree on production limits , prices have plummeted as production soared .
`` OPEC had a commendable record in the past year , and now one of its founding members is not taking part in their agreement , '' said Gary N. Ross , chief executive of PIRA Energy Group , an oil industry research firm based in New York .
Wednesday 's split comes after a bitter test of wills between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which was determined to reverse the price cuts of last year and to allow the price of oil to settle at about $ 25 a barrel , compared with about $ 27.50 today and its recent high of $ 34 in early March .
Saudi officials wanted to raise prices , partly because the United States is its biggest market and partly because of concern about political wrath from Congress , where some lawmakers have pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of military equipment to OPEC nations .
Iranian leaders , on the other hand , had angrily denounced American demands and insisted that OPEC should not make decisions in response to political pressure .
Oil experts , as well as Saudi leaders , argued here that Iran was already producing virtually all the oil it could pump , about 3 million barrels a day , and that any increase in production would come from other countries -- Saudi Arabia in particular -- leading to lower prices that could hurt Iran .
Saudi Arabia , with a daily output of 7.6 million barrels , has enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks .
Saudi officials , alarmed when prices suddenly surged recently to around $ 30 a barrel , adamantly demanded an increase in OPEC output that would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices .
The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders intensively for the last several weeks , arguing that the world markets needed as much as 2.5 million extra barrels a day to meet demand and to restore depleted inventories .
It has been clear that OPEC would not go that far , but Saudi Arabia had managed to persuade all other members except Iran to reverse the cuts they had imposed on themselves last year .
The Saudi plan had called for an increase of 1.7 million OPEC barrels of oil a day in production limits .
Even with the agreement Wednesday morning , many OPEC leaders were still fuming about what they viewed as heavy-handed pressure from Washington that only made their own political situation more awkward .
Venezuelan leaders , taking a cue from their outspoken president , Hugo Chavez , have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed as puppets of the American government , and went out of their way last week to criticize lobbying efforts by Richardson , the energy secretary .
Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to the United States .
On Monday , Iranian officials almost gleefully pounced on the issue of American pressure when Richardson reportedly called the oil minister of Qatar , another OPEC member , just as he was meeting with his counterparts .
Though modest , the proposed increases are still significant .
Indeed , oil prices have already drifted down about 18 percent since March 8 , to about $ 28 a barrel from $ 34 , and most of that decline reflected the anticipation that OPEC would agree on an increase of roughly that magnitude .
Saudi officials have made it clear that they would like to see the price of oil settle at around $ 25 a barrel , a price they believe could be sustained and would allow the United States and other major oil-consuming countries to rebuild their badly depleted inventories .
But the increase would also fall well short of what the Saudis envisioned .
Experts said it would provide only a modest relief in gasoline prices .
Rilwanu Lukman , secretary general of OPEC , tried to put the best possible face on Wednesday 's split , noting that countries have on occasion dissented from the organization 's decisions before .
`` We will remain as a group despite all of these tensions , '' he said after Iran announced that it would not join in the agreement .
`` Many people wrote off OPEC many years ago , and we 're still here . ''
