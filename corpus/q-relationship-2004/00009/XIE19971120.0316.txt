WASHINGTON , November 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said here on Wednesday that his country may drop plans for a possible pipeline through Iran if the United States could finance for an alternative by next October .
The United States has pressured the Central Asian country in their two-day joint commission meeting to shelve the Iran option in favor of a U.S. backed pipeline through Azerbaijan , Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea .
`` We 'd support the project that can be implemented in the quickest way , '' Nazarbayev told reporters at the end of his visit to the United states .
`` And if work on that U.S. -proposed line could in fact start after October 1998 , we are willing to cease work on these other projects and make that our pipeline choice . ''
The United States supports multiple pipelines to get Caspian Sea oil to the West but opposes routes that involve Iran , which it tries to isolate by sanctions .
