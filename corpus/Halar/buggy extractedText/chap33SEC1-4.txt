PROTOSTOMIA: ECDYSOZOA

 

 Phylum Nematoda: Roundworms are nonsegmented pseudocoelomates covered by tough cuticles



 

 Arthropods are segmented coelomates with exoskeletons and jointed appendages



Though the ecdysozoans are considered a clade based mainly on the data of molecular systematics, this branch of protostomes is named for a characteristic of life history: ecdysis, the shedding of an exoskeleton outgrown by the animal. Of the several ecdysozoan phyla, we will examine only the nematodes and the arthropods.
