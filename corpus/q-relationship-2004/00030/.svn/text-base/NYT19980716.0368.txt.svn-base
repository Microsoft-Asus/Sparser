BOSTON --
The Senate Thursday passed the final version of an assault weapons ban that , in all likelihood , will give Massachusetts one of the strongest and most comprehensive gun control laws in the country .
The measure bans all forms of assault weapons that were made after 1994 , when a federal assault weapons ban took effect .
It also adds restrictions to all other weapons .
`` This bill will give Massachusetts what is the toughest gun control law in the country , '' Senator Cheryl Jacques said in announcing an agreement struck between both legislative branches .
`` What this bill is going to do is make sure gun owners take dead seriously their responsibility to safely store their weapons or face criminal penalties .
I would have preferred -LRB- a total -RRB- ban ... -LRB- but -RRB- this bill is chock full of good stuff . ''
The Massachusetts bill mirrors the 1994 federal ban , which the state had to adopt to prosecute criminals under that law .
But the Massachusetts bill goes further -- it adds a layer of penalties and safety regulations on the industry , including mandatory safety locks on any new gun sold in the state .
The bill does not , however , prohibit the sale or resale of assault weapons that were manufactured before 1994 .
In addition , the compromise deal scraps the idea of a politically appointed board that could overrule police chiefs ' discretion in handing out firearm licenses .
Nancy Snow , executive secretary of the Gun Owners Action League , condemned the legislation -- which she agreed was the most far-reaching in the country -- for its increased licensing fees .
She believes it gives too much power to police chiefs in determining who should be granted permission to carry a firearm , without an easy appeal process .
The agreement , announced Thursday , was immediately passed by the Senate , 22-14 , with mostly Republicans rejecting the legislation .
The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed by Acting Governor Paul Cellucci by July 31 .
Cellucci lauded the deal .
`` I would have preferred a total ban , '' Cellucci said , `` ... but this is a significant gun control initiative .
I will sign the bill . ''
John Rosenthal , founder of the Boston -based Stop Handgun Violence , called the legislation a national model .
`` I can tell you from personal experience in meeting at the White House -LRB- that -RRB- the whole country is watching what Massachusetts is doing , '' Rosenthal said .
`` My disappointment is that we still allow the possession and sale of assault weapons in a society where we do n't even allow our state troopers to carry anything more powerful than a shotgun ...
That is insane .
Our job is not done , but this legislation goes a long way to fill some holes . ''
The House version of the bill set up a politically appointed appeals board that could overrule police chief 's decisions on granting gun licenses .
But police chiefs from across the state protested that provision , winning out in the end .
Snow also predicted licensing backlogs .
`` Every gun owner will run afoul of some provision at some time because it 's so confusing and so comprehensive , '' Snow said .
`` I 'm very thankful that the Legislature did see the wisdom of not doing a conventional assault weapons ban , but at the same time we are very unhappy with the liberty they 've taken with gun owners ' lives . ''
The legislation : _Adopts the federal assault weapons ban , which prohibits the possession or sale of guns manufactured after Sept. 13 , 1994 .
This will allow for state prosecution of anyone violating the federal ban .

Existing guns must be fitted with locks or kept in a safe .

Cities and towns would keep the other half of the money .
_Prohibits violent felons and those convicted of drug trafficking from ever carrying or owning a gun .
_Prohibits the possession of sawed-off shotguns , so-called gadget guns , and Saturday Night Specials , which are inexpensive and poorly made handguns .
