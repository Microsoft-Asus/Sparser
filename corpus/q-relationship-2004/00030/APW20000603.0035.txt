NEW YORK
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Sen. Chuck Schumer announced a new gun licensing proposal on Friday and said New Yorkers should elect Hillary Rodham Clinton to join him in the Senate so that she can vote for it .
`` New Yorkers deserve a senator in Washington who we can absolutely count on every single time there 's a critical gun control vote , '' said Schumer , who joined fellow Democrat Clinton at a news conference at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers .
`` No hesitation , no equivocation , no waiting till the last minute to announce a position , but true , iron-clad commitment to stand with the people of New York on gun control , '' Schumer said .
`` New York needs Hillary Clinton because she will vote with us on gun control 100 percent of the time . ''
Schumer said that under his proposal , which he will formally introduce next week , a person would have to pass a gun-safety course and obtain a gun license in order to buy a firearm .
`` This will be a three-year renewable photo license that can be easily renewed just like a driver 's license or a passport at state agencies , so long as the individual has not committed a crime or done some other act that makes them ineligible to own a gun , '' he said .
Clinton , who is running for U.S. Senate against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio , said the proposal `` is the right fight for New York , and it 's the right fight for our children and families . ''
`` I 'm happy to be here today to state my very strong support for Chuck 's new landmark gun-licensing legislation , '' she said .
Lazio , a four-term congressman from Long Island , has backed a variety of gun control measures but has called licensing `` invasive . ''
`` I 'm proud of my record on guns , '' Lazio said during a campaign stop at a Brooklyn day-care center earlier Friday .
`` I 'm a former prosecutor .
I 've stood with law enforcement .
I was a co-sponsor of the Brady Bill .
Did n't just talk about it .
I did it .
I voted for the assault weapons ban .
I did n't just talk about it .
I did it . ''
Asked about handgun registration , he said he has not seen a plan that is `` workable '' and he favors other gun-control measures .
`` We have smart-gun technology which is now already developed , '' Lazio said .
`` If you have only the person who owns the gun who can shoot the gun , where you have the ability to track potentially the ammunition .
There 's a lot of things that we can do from a technological standpoint that will be much less bureaucratic and much less invasive and will yield at least as good results , if not better . ''
Clinton 's position on gun control was virtually indistinguishable from that of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , whose exit from the Senate race because of his prostate cancer opened the door for Lazio .
The first lady said she would fight Lazio on the issues , adding , `` Supporting this bill is another one of the important differences between me and my opponent . ''
