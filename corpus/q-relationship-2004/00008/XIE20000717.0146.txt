TOKYO , July 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Tokyo District Court on Monday sentenced two former members of the AUM Shinrikyo to death and handed a life imprisonment sentence to another former member for their involvement in the 1995 sarin nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subway system which killed 12 people and injured thousands .
Toru Toyoda and Kenichi Hirose were sentenced to death after they were found guilty on murder and attempted murder charges while Shigeo Sugimoto received a life imprisonment sentence .
In announcing the ruling , Presiding Judge Manabu Yamazaki said Toyoda and Hirose bear a huge amount of responsibility for the attack which he called cruel and indiscriminate .
The judge said the cult started to espouse religious dogma which justified murder after its founder , Shoko Asahara , suffered a crushing defeat in the House of Representatives election in 1990 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Afterwards , the cult began to arm itself and Asahara ordered a number of its senior members to produce sarin , the deadly nerve gas used in the subway attack .</ENAMEX>
Yamazaki said the three defendants conspired with Asahara in the subway gassing and other crimes instigated by the cult .
Toyoda and Hirose are the last of the five-member AUM squad that carried out the subway attack .
One of the other members received life imprisonment and two have been sentenced to death .
The attackers targeted five trains on the Tokyo subway system March 20 , 1995 .
During the morning rush hour , Toyoda and Hirose released liquid sarin on two trains , the ruling said .
Sugimoto served as a driver for Yasuo Hayashi , another member of the squad .
The three defendants were also on trial in connection with various other charges including an attempt to assassinate then Tokyo Governor Yukio Aoshima by mailing a parcel bomb to the Tokyo metropolitan government office in May 1995 .
The package exploded when Aoshima 's secretary opened it , causing the secretary to lose all the fingers of his left hand , the ruling said .
