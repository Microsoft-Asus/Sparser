SAN FRANCISCO --
Republican Rep. Tom Campbell called Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein `` China 's best friend '' and urged California 's senior senator to take a tough position against Beijing 's recent threats against Taiwan .
Campbell , who represents the San Jose area , hopes to unseat Feinstein in this year 's election .
In a news conference held Monday outside the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco , Campbell challenged Feinstein to warn Beijing that using force against Taiwan would sabotage its entry into the World Trade Organization .
A statement issued later in the day by Feinstein did not refer to Campbell but said China 's `` bellicose statements '' toward Taiwan were `` counterproductive and regrettable . ''
`` I have indicated my strong disapproval and deep concern to China , '' the statement said .
`` A peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue is the only constructive alternative . ''
Although both seek eventual reunification , mainland China considers the island of Taiwan to be a renegade province .
Beijing has recently indicated it was willing to use force to reunite the two .
Wang Yunxiang , Beijing 's consul general in San Francisco , was unruffled by what Campbell said .
`` Connecting the Taiwan issue with the WTO is absurd , '' Wang said .
`` They are two different things . ''
Beijing 's threats against Taiwan , made in a recent policy document , came just weeks before the island 's national elections on March 18 .
The timing is not unusual .
Before the 1996 presidential election , the People 's Republic of China fired missiles off Taiwan 's shores .
Wang said the harsher tact is aimed at carrying out Beijing 's `` one China '' policy .
`` It reflects the common aspirations of the Chinese people , '' Wang said .
`` Hong Kong was returned to the motherland in 1997 .
We have one country , two systems .
We can see that is very much successful .
Then , in December , Macao was returned .
Now , I think the Taiwan issue is being brought to our agenda . ''
If `` political negotiation '' is unsuccessful , Wang said , `` The central government will have to take nonpeaceful means . ''
The sovereignty of Taiwan has been a tinderbox issue since Chiang Kai -shek 's Nationalist forces fled there after losing to the Communist forces under Mao Zedong .
Campbell said any threats of force would be `` absolutely contrary to the purposes of the WTO '' and would sink any chance that China 's entry into trade body would be ratified this year .
`` Their statement about the use of military force to take Taiwan is utterly unacceptable , '' Campbell said .
Advocates representing nine Taiwanese - American organizations joined Campbell at the news conference .
`` Not one inch of Taiwan was ever part of the PRC , '' said Keelong Hong , a medical researcher at the California Pacific Medical Center who heads the North American Taiwanese Professors Association .
`` China must renounce its use of force . ''
Davis Chang , a retired San Jose State University accounting professor and president of the Hakka Association of America , accused China of destabilizing Taiwan because it is threatened by the election in Taiwan .
`` They like to intimidate people , '' he said .
`` But people should have the right to elect their own president . ''
