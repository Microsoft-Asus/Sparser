Every mealtime is a reminder that we are heterotrophs dependent on a regular supply of food derived from other or ganisms. As a group, animals exhibit a great variety of nutritional adaptations. The snowshoe hare shown in the photograph on this page is adapted for life in northern forests. Able to obtain all their nutritional needs from plants alone, hares and rabbits have a large intestinal pouch housing prokaryotes and protists that digest cellulose. When deep snow covers the ground, a hare can live on pine, fir, or spruce branches--often the only plant materials available.

For any animal, a nutritionally adequate diet is essential for homeostasis, a steady-state balance in body function. A balanced diet provides fuel for cellular work, as well as all the materials the body needs to construct its own organic molecules. In this chapter we will examine the nutritional requirements of animals and look at some of the diverse adaptations for obtaining and processing food.

The general principles of food processing are similar for a diversity of animals, so we can use the digestive system of mammals as a representative example. The mammalian digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and various accessory glands that secrete digestive juices into the canal through ducts. Peristalsis, rhythmic waves of contraction by smooth muscles in the wall of the canal, pushes the food along the tract. At some of the junctions between specialized segments of the digestive tube, the muscular layer is modified into ringlike valves called sphincters, which close off the tube like drawstrings, regulating the passage of material between chambers of the canal. The accessory glands of the mammalian digestive system are three pairs of salivary glands, the pancreas, the liver, and the gallbladder, which stores a digestive juice.

Using the human digestive system as a model, we now follow a meal through the alimentary canal, seeing in more detail what happens to the food in each of the processing stations along the way (FIGURE 41.13).

After chewing and swallowing, it takes only 5 to 10 seconds for food to pass down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it spends 2 to 6 hours being partially digested. Final digestion and nutrient absorption occur in the small intestine over a period of 5 to 6 hours. In 12 to 24 hours, any undigested material passes through the large intestine, and feces are expelled through the anus.

 Animals are heterotrophs that require food for fuel, carbon skeletons, and essential nutrients:an overview

A nutritionally adequate diet satisfies three needs: fuel (chemical energy) for all the cellular work of the body; the organic raw materials animals use in biosynthesis (carbon skeletons to make many of their own molecules); and essential nutrients, substances that the animal cannot make for itself from any raw material and therefore must obtain in food in prefabricated form.





 Homeostatic mechanisms manage an animal's fuel

The theme of bioenergetics is integral to our study of nutrition. As we saw in Chapter 40, the flow of food energy into and out of an animal can be viewed as a "budget," with the production of ATP accounting for the largest fraction by far of the energy budgets of most animals. The ATP powers basal or resting metabolism as well as activity and, in endotherms, temperature regulation. Nearly all of this ATP is derived from oxidation of organ ic fuel molecules--carbohydrates, proteins, and fats--in cellular respiration. The monomers of any of these substances can be used as fuel, though priority is usually given to carbohydrates and fats. Fats are especially rich in energy; the oxidation of fat liberates about twice the energy liberated from an equal amount of carbohydrate or protein.

Glucose Regulation as an Example of Homeostasis in Nutrition

When an animal takes in more calories than it needs to produce ATP, the excess can be used for biosynthesis. If the animal isn't growing in size or reproducing, the body tends to store the surplus in energy depots. In humans, the liver and muscle cells store energy in the form of glycogen, a polymer made up of many glucose units (see FIGURE 5.6b). Glucose is a major fuel molecule for cells, and its metabolism, regulated by hormone action, is an important aspect of homeostasis (FIGURE 41.1). If glycogen stores are full and caloric intake still exceeds caloric expenditure, the excess is usually stored as fat.

Fig 41-1. Homeostatic regulation of cellular fuel. The human body regulates the use and storage of glucose, a major cellular fuel. After a meal is digested, glucose and other monomers are absorbed into the blood from the digestive tract.

When fewer calories are taken in than are expended--perhaps because of sustained heavy exercise or lack of food--fuel is taken out of storage depots and oxidized. This may cause an animal to lose weight. The human body generally expends liver glycogen first, and then draws on muscle glycogen and fat. Most healthy people--even if they are not obese--have enough stored fat to sustain them through several weeks of starvation (an average human's energy needs can be fueled by the oxidation of only 0.3 kg of fat per day).

Caloric Imbalance

Severe problems occur if the energy budget remains out of balance for long periods. If the diet of a person or other animal is chronically deficient in calories, undernourishment results. In this condition, the stores of glycogen and fat are used up, the body begins breaking down its own proteins for fuel, muscles begin to decrease in size, and the brain can become protein-deficient. If energy intake remains less than energy expenditures, death will eventually result. Even if a seriously undernourished person survives, some of the damage may be irreversible. Because a diet of a single staple such as rice or corn can often provide sufficient calories, undernourishment is generally common only where drought, war, or some other crisis has severely disrupted the food supply. Another cause of undernourishment is anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder associated with a compulsive aversion to body fat.

Detrimental effects also result from excessive food intake. In the United States and other affluent nations, overnourishment, or obesity, is a common problem. The human body hoards fat. It tends to store any excess fat molecules obtained from food instead of using them for fuel. In contrast, when we eat an excess of carbohydrates, the body tends to increase its rate of carbohydrate oxidation. Thus, the amount of fat in the diet can have a more direct effect on weight gain than the amount of dietary carbohydrates. Fat hoarding can be a liability today, but it probably provided a fitness advantage for our hunting/gathering ancestors. Individuals with genes promoting the storage of high-energy molecules during feasts may have been those that survived famines.

Obesity

Despite its propensity to store fat, the human body seems to impose limits on weight gain (and loss). Some people remain lean and hold a more-or-less constant weight no matter how much they eat. Even obese people usually attain a relatively stable weight, generally unaffected by how much they eat. Most dieters return to their former weight soon after they stop dieting. These observations, along with several recent discoveries, suggest that complex feedback mechanisms regulate fat storage and use. In mammals, a hormone called leptin, produced by adipose cells, is a key player. An increase in adipose tissue increases leptin levels in the blood. A high leptin level cues the brain to depress appetite and to increase energy-consuming muscular activity and body-heat production. Conversely, loss of body fat decreases leptin levels in the blood, signaling the brain to increase appetite and weight gain. Apparently these feedback mechanisms regulate body weight around a fairly rigid set point in some individuals and over a relatively wide range in others. Researchers have also identified some of the genes involved in fat homeostasis and several chemical signals that underlie the brain's regulatory roles (FIGURE 41.2). Some of the signals and signal antagonists are under development as potential medications for obesity.

Obesity may actually be beneficial in certain species. Small seabirds called petrels must fly long distances to find food. Most of the food petrel parents bring to their chicks is very rich in lipids. This minimizes the weight of the food the birds must carry during their long foraging trips (recall that fat has twice as many calories per gram as other fuels). However, in addition to energy, growing baby petrels need lots of protein for building new tissues. There is relatively little protein in their oily diet, so in order to get all the protein they need, young petrels have to consume many more calories than they burn in metabolism--and consequently they become very obese. In some petrel species, chicks at the end of the growth period weigh much more than their parents and are far too heavy to fly. These fat youngsters need to starve for several days to lose enough weight to be capable of flight. However, the fat depots in young petrels do serve an important function; the energy reserves help growing chicks survive periods when parents are unable to find enough food.





 An animal's diet must supply essential nutrients and carbon skeletons for biosynthesis

In addition to providing fuel for ATP production, an animal's diet must also supply all the raw materials needed for biosynthesis. To build the complex molecules it needs to grow and maintain itself, an animal must obtain organic precursors (carbon skeletons) from its food. Given a source of organic carbon (such as sugar) and a source of organic nitrogen (usually in amino acids from the digestion of protein), animals can fabricate a great variety of organic molecules--carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.

Besides fuel and carbon skeletons, an animal's diet must also supply essential nutrients. These are materials that must be obtained in preassembled form because the animal's cells cannot make them from any raw material (FIGURE 41.3). Some of these materials are essential for all animals, but others are needed only by certain species. For instance, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient for humans and other primates, guinea pigs, and some birds and snakes, but not for most other animals.

Fig 41-3. Obtaining essential nutrients. A giraffe, an herbivore of East Africa, chews on old bones from a dead mammal. Bones contain calcium phosphate, and osteophagia ("bone-eating") is common among herbivores living where soils and plants are deficient in phosphorus. Animals require phosphorus as a mineral nutrient to make ATP, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and bones.

An animal whose diet is missing one or more essential nutrients is said to be malnourished (recall that undernourished refers to caloric deficiency). For example, cattle and other herbivorous animals may suffer mineral deficiencies if they graze on plants growing in soil lacking key minerals (see FIGURE 41.3). Malnutrition is much more common than undernutrition in human populations, and it is even possible for an overnourished individual to be malnourished.

There are four classes of essential nutrients: essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Essential Amino Acids

Animals require 20 amino acids to make proteins, and most animal species can synthesize about half of these, as long as their diet includes organic nitrogen. The remaining ones, the essential amino acids, must be obtained from food in prefabricated form. Eight amino acids are essential in the adult human diet (a ninth, histidine, is essential for infants); the same amino acids are essential for most animals.

A diet that provides insufficent amounts of one or more essential amino acids causes a form of malnutrition known as protein deficiency. This is the most common type of malnutrition among humans. The victims are usually children, who, if they survive infancy, are likely to be retarded in physical and perhaps mental development.

The most reliable sources of essential amino acids are meat, eggs, cheese, and other animal products. The proteins in animal products are "complete," which means that they provide all the essential amino acids in their proper proportions. Most plant proteins are "incomplete," being deficient in one or more essential amino acids. Corn, for example, is deficient in the amino acid lysine. People forced by economic necessity or other circumstances to obtain nearly all their calories from corn would show symptoms of protein deficiency, as would those who eat only rice, wheat, or potatoes. This problem can be avoided by eating a combination of plant foods that complement one another to supply all essential amino acids. For example, beans supply the lysine that is missing in corn; and while beans are deficient in methionine, this essential amino acid is present in corn. Thus, a diet of beans and corn provides all the essential amino acids--as long as these vegetables are both consumed during the same day (FIGURE 41.4). Because the body cannot easily store amino acids, a deficiency of a single essential amino acid, even for a relatively short period, retards protein synthesis and limits the use of other amino acids. Most cultures have, by trial and error, developed balanced diets that prevent protein deficiency.

Some animals have special adaptations that get them through periods when their bodies demand extraordinary amounts of protein. For example, penguins can use their muscle protein as a source of amino acids to make new proteins when they replace their feathers after molting (FIGURE 41.5).

Fig 41-5. Storing protein for growth. Penguins, such as this Ad&eacute;lie from Antarctica, must make an abundance of new protein when they molt (grow new feathers). Penguins replace all their feathers at once during a two- to three-week period. Because of the temporary loss of their insulating coat of feathers, penguins cannot swim--or feed--when molting. What is the source of amino acids for production of feather protein? There is no special storage tissue for free amino acids, but it is possible to store amino acids in certain proteins. Before molting, a penguin greatly increases its muscle mass. The penguin then breaks down the extra muscle protein, which supplies the amino acids for growing new feathers.

Essential Fatty Acids

Animals can synthesize most of the fatty acids they need. The essential fatty acids, the ones they cannot make, are certain unsaturated fatty acids (fatty acids having double bonds; see FIGURE 5.11). In humans, for example, linoleic acid must be present in the diet. This essential fatty acid is required to make some of the phospholipids found in membranes. Most diets furnish ample quantities of essential fatty acids, and thus deficiencies are rare.

Vitamins

Vitamins are organic molecules required in the diet in amounts that are quite small compared with the relatively large quantities of essential amino acids and fatty acids animals need. Tiny amounts of vitamins may suffice--from about 0.01 to 100 mg per day--depending on the vitamin. However, vitamin deficiencies can cause severe problems.

So far, 13 vitamins essential to humans have been identified. They have extremely diverse physiological functions. Vitamins are grouped into two categories: water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins (TABLE 41.1). The water-soluble vitamins include the B complex, which consists of several compounds that generally function as coenzymes in key metabolic processes. Vitamin C, also water-soluble, is required for the production of connective tissue. Excesses of water-soluble vitamins are excreted in urine, and moderate overdoses of these vitamins are probably harmless.

They have a wide variety of functions. Vitamin A is incorporated into visual pigments of the eye. Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption and bone formation. The function of vitamin E is not yet fully understood, but along with vitamin C it seems to protect the phospholipids in membranes from oxidation (you have probably encountered advertisements for dietary supplements containing vitamin E as an "antioxidant.") Vitamin K is required for blood clotting. Excesses of fat-soluble vitamins are not excreted but are deposited in body fat, so overconsumption may result in an accumulation of these compounds to toxic levels.

The subject of vitamin dosage has aroused heated scientific and popular debate. Some believe it is sufficient to meet recommended daily allowances (RDAs), the nutrient intakes proposed by nutritionists to maintain health. Others argue that RDAs are set too low for some vitamins, and a fraction of those people believe, probably mistakenly, that massive doses of vitamins confer health benefits. Research is far from complete, and debate continues, especially over optimal doses of vitamins C and E. At this time, all that can be said with any certainty is that people who eat a balanced diet are not likely to develop symptoms of vitamin deficiency.

Minerals

Minerals are simple inorganic nutrients, usually required in small amounts--from less than 1 mg to about 2,500 mg per day (TABLE 41.2). As with vitamins, mineral requirements vary with animal species. Humans and other vertebrates require relatively large quantities of calcium and phosphorus for the construction and maintenance of bone. Calcium is also necessary for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles, and phosphorus is also an ingredient of ATP and nucleic acids. Iron is a component of the cytochromes that function in cellular respiration (see FIGURE 9.13) and of hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of red blood cells. Magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and molybdenum are cofactors built into the structure of certain enzymes; magnesium, for example, is present in enzymes that split ATP. Vertebrates need iodine to make thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolic rate. Sodium, potassium, and chlorine are important in nerve function and also have a major influence on the osmotic balance between cells and the interstitial fluid.

The average U.S. citizen eats enough salt to provide about 20 times the required amount of sodium. Ingesting an excess of salt or several other minerals can upset homeostatic balance and cause toxic side effects. For example, too much sodium is associated with high blood pressure, and excess iron can cause liver damage.

We now shift our attention to the kinds of foods that animals eat and how they process these foods to meet their nutritional needs.





 Most animals are opportunistic feeders

All animals eat other organisms--dead or alive, whole or by the piece. (We'll stretch "by the piece" to include parasites such as tapeworms that absorb organic molecules from host organisms across their body surface.) In general, animals fit into one of three dietary categories. Herbivores, such as gorillas, cows, hares, and many snails, eat mainly autotrophs (plants, algae). Carnivores, such as sharks, hawks, spiders, and snakes, eat other animals. Omnivores regularly consume animals as well as plant or algal matter. Omnivorous animals include cockroaches, crows, bears, raccoons, and humans, who evolved as hunters, scavengers, and gatherers.

The terms herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore represent the kinds of food an animal usually eats and the adaptations enabling it to obtain and process that food. However, most animals are opportunistic, eating foods that are outside their main dietary category when these foods are available. For example, cattle and deer, which are herbivores, may occasionally eat small animals or bird eggs, along with grass and other plants. Most carnivores obtain some nutrients from plant materials that remain in the digestive tract of the prey they eat. And all animals consume bacteria with other types of food.





 Diverse feeding adaptations have evolved among animals

The mechanisms by which animals ingest food are highly varied but fall into four main groups. Many aquatic animals are suspension-feeders that sift small food particles from the water. Clams and oysters, for example, use their gills to trap tiny morsels, which are then swept along with a film of mucus to the mouth by beating cilia. Baleen whales, the largest animals ever to live, are also suspension-feeders. They swim with their mouths agape, straining millions of small animals from huge volumes of water forced through screenlike plates attached to their jaws (FIGURE 41.6).

Fig 41-6. Suspension-feeding: a baleen whale. The humpback whale and other baleen whales use comblike plates suspended from the upper jaw to sift small invertebrates from enormous volumes of water. The whale opens its mouth and fills an expandable oral pouch with water, then closes its mouth and contracts the pouch. This forces water out of the mouth through the baleen, leaving a mouthful of trapped food.

Substrate-feeders live in or on their food source, eating their way through the food. Examples are maggots that burrow into animal carcasses, and leaf miners, which are larvae of various insects that tunnel through the interior of leaves (FIGURE 41.7). Earthworms are also substrate-feeders or, more specifically, deposit-feeders. Eating their way through the dirt, earthworms salvage partially decayed organic material consumed along with soil.

Fig 41-7. Substrate-feeding: a leaf miner. Eating its way through the soft mesophyll of an oak leaf, this caterpillar, the larva of a moth, leaves a trail of dark feces in its wake.

Fluid-feeders make their living by sucking nutrient-rich fluids from a living host (FIGURE 41.8). Mosquitoes and leeches suck blood from animals. Aphids tap the phloem sap of plants (see FIGURE 36.18). Because these fluid-feeding species harm their hosts, they are considered parasites. Hummingbirds and bees, however, are fluid-feeders that benefit their host plants, transferring pollen as they move from flower to flower to obtain nectar.

Fig 41-8. Fluid-feeding: a mosquito. This parasite has pierced the skin of its human host with hollow needlelike mouthparts and is filling its digestive tract with a blood meal (colorized SEM).

Most animals are bulk-feeders that eat relatively large pieces of food (FIGURE 41.9). Their adaptations include such diverse utensils as tentacles, pincers, claws, poisonous fangs, and jaws and teeth that kill their prey or tear off pieces of meat or vegetation.

Fig 41-9. Bulk-feeding: a python. Most animals ingest relatively large pieces of food. This is especially true of snakes, which cannot chew their food into pieces and must swallow it whole--even if the prey is much bigger than the diameter of the snake. In this amazing scene, a rock python is beginning to ingest a gazelle it has captured and killed. After swallowing its prey, which may take more than an hour, the snake will spend two weeks or more in a quiet place digesting its meal.





 The four main stages of food processing are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination

Ingestion, the act of eating, is only the first stage of food processing. Nearly all animals, even many fluid-feeders, must deal with food that is "packaged" in bulk form and contains very complex arrays of molecules, including large polymers and various substances that may be difficult to process or may even be toxic. Organic material in food consists largely of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the form of starch and other polysaccharides. Animals cannot use these macromolecules directly, for two reasons. First, polymers are too large to pass through membranes and enter the cells of the animal. Second, the macromolecules that make up an animal are not identical to those of its food. In building their macromolecules, however, all organisms use common monomers--for example, soybeans, fruit flies, and humans all assemble their proteins from the same 20 amino acids.

Digestion, the second stage of food processing, is the process of breaking food down into molecules small enough for the body to absorb. Digestion cleaves macromolecules into their component monomers, which the animal then uses to make its own molecules or as fuel for ATP production. Polysaccharides and disaccharides are split into simple sugars, fats are digested to glycerol and fatty acids, proteins are broken down into amino acids, and nucleic acids are cleaved into nucleotides.

Recall from Chapter 5 that when a cell makes a macromolecule by linking together monomers, it does so by removing a molecule of water for each new covalent bond formed. Digestion reverses this process by breaking bonds with the enzymatic addition of water (see FIGURE 5.2). This splitting process is called enzymatic hydrolysis. A variety of hydrolytic enzymes catalyze the digestion of each of the classes of macromolecules found in food. This chemical digestion is usually preceded by mechanical fragmentation of the food--by chewing, for instance. Breaking food into smaller pieces increases the surface area exposed to digestive juices containing hydrolytic enzymes.

The last two stages of food processing occur after the food is digested. In the third stage, absorption, the animal's cells take up (absorb) small molecules such as amino acids and simple sugars from the digestive compartment. Finally, elimination occurs, as undigested material passes out of the digestive compartment.





 Digestion occurs in specialized compartments

How do animals apply their digestive processes to food without digesting their own cells and tissues? After all, digestive enzymes hydrolyze the same biological materials (such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) that animals are made of, and it is obviously important to avoid digesting oneself! Most animals reduce the risk of self-digestion by processing food in specialized compartments.

Intracellular Digestion

Food vacuoles--organelles in which hydrolytic enzymes break down food without digesting the cell's own cytoplasm--are the simplest digestive compartments. Heterotrophic protists digest their meals in food vacuoles, usually after engulfing food by phagocytosis or pinocytosis (see FIGURE 8.19a). Newly formed food vacuoles fuse with lysosomes, which are organelles containing hydrolytic enzymes. This mixes the food with the enzymes, allowing digestion to occur safely within a compartment that is enclosed by a protective membrane. This is termed intracellular digestion (FIGURE 41.10). Sponges are unusual among animals in that they digest their food entirely by the intracellular mechanism, as do heterotrophic protists (which are not animals) (see FIGURE 33.3).

Fig 41-10. Intracellular digestion in Paramecium.

Extracellular Digestion

In most animals, at least some hydrolysis occurs by extracellular digestion, the breakdown of food outside cells. Extracellular digestion occurs within compartments that are continuous with the outside of the animal's body. Having an extracellular cavity for digestion enables an animal to devour much larger prey than can be ingested by phagocytosis and digested intracellularly.

Many animals with simple body plans have digestive sacs with single openings. These pouches, called gastrovascular cavities, function in both digestion and distribution of nutrients throughout the body (hence, the vascular part of the term). The cnidarians called hydras provide a good example of how a gastrovascular cavity works. Hydras are carnivores that sting prey with specialized organelles called nematocysts and then use tentacles to stuff the food through the mouth into the gastrovascular cavity (FIGURE 41.11). With food in the cavity, specialized cells of the gastrodermis, the tissue layer that lines the cavity, secrete digestive enzymes that break the soft tissues of the prey into tiny pieces. Gastrodermal cells then engulf the food particles, and most of the actual hydrolysis of macromolecules occurs intracellularly, as in Paramecium and sponges. After a hydra has digested its meal, undigested materials remaining in the gastrovascular cavity, such as the exoskeletons of small crustaceans, are eliminated through the single opening, which functions in the dual role of mouth and anus. Many flatworms also have a gastrovascular cavity with a single opening (see FIGURE 33.10).

Fig 41-11. Extracellular digestion in a gastrovascular cavity. The outer epidermis of the cnidarian hydra has protective and sensory functions, whereas the inner gastrodermis is specialized for digestion. Digestion begins in the gastrovascular cavity and is completed intracellularly after small food particles are engulfed by the gastrodermal cells.

In contrast to cnidarians and flatworms, most animals--including nematodes, annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates--have digestive tubes extending between two openings, a mouth and an anus. These tubes are called complete digestive tracts or alimentary canals. Because food moves along the canal in one direction, the tube can be organized into specialized regions that carry out digestion and nutrient absorption in a stepwise fashion (FIGURE 41.12). Food ingested through the mouth and pharynx passes through an esophagus that leads to a crop, gizzard, or stomach, depending on the species. Crops and stomachs usually serve as food storage organs (although some digestion may occur there), whereas gizzards grind and fragment food. The food next enters the intestine, where digestive enzymes hydrolyze the food molecules, and nutrients are absorbed across the lining of the tube into the blood. Undigested wastes are eliminated through the anus. Another advantage of a complete digestive tract is the ability to ingest additional food before earlier meals are completely digested--which may be difficult or inefficient for animals with gastrovascular cavities.

 The oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus initiate food processing

The Oral Cavity

Both physical and chemical digestion of food begin in the mouth. During chewing, teeth of various shapes cut, smash, and grind food, making it easier to swallow and increasing its surface area. The presence of food in the oral cavity triggers a nervous reflex that causes the salivary glands to deliver saliva through ducts to the oral cavity. Even before food is actually in the mouth, salivation may occur in anticipation because of learned associations between eating and the time of day, cooking odors, or other stimuli. In humans, more than a liter of saliva is secreted each day.

Saliva contains a slippery glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called mucin, which protects the soft lining of the mouth from abrasion and lubricates the food for easier swallowing. Saliva also contains buffers that help prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acid in the mouth. Antibacterial agents in saliva kill many of the bacteria that enter the mouth with food.

Chemical digestion of carbohydrates, a main source of chemical energy, begins in the oral cavity. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch (a glucose polymer from plants) and glycogen (a glucose polymer from animals). The main products of this enzyme's action are smaller polysaccharides and the disaccharide maltose.

The tongue tastes food, manipulates it during chewing, and helps shape the food into a ball called a bolus. During swallowing, the tongue pushes a bolus to the back of the oral cavity and into the pharynx.

The Pharynx

The region we call our throat is the pharynx, a junction that opens to both the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea). When we swallow, the top of the windpipe moves up so that its opening, the glottis, is blocked by a cartilaginous flap, the epiglottis. You can see this motion in the bobbing of the "Adam's apple" during swallowing. This carefully controlled mechanism normally ensures that a bolus will be guided into the entrance of the esophagus (FIGURE 41.14, steps one and two). On rare occasions when food or liquids go "down the wrong pipe" because the swallowing reflex didn't close the opening of the windpipe in time, the blockage of airflow to the lungs can be fatal.

The Esophagus

The esophagus conducts food from the pharynx down to the stomach by peristalsis (FIGURE 41.14, step six). The muscles at the very top of the esophagus are striated (voluntary). Thus, the act of swallowing begins voluntarily, but then the involuntary waves of contraction by smooth muscles in the rest of the esophagus take over.





 The stomach stores food and performs preliminary digestion

The stomach is located in the upper abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm. With accordionlike folds and a very elastic wall, the stomach can stretch to accommodate about 2 L of food and fluid. Because this large organ can store an entire meal, we do not need to eat constantly. Besides storing food, the stomach performs important digestive functions: it secretes a digestive fluid called gastric juice and mixes this secretion with the food by the churning action of the smooth muscles in the stomach wall.

Gastric juice is secreted by the epithelium lining numerous deep pits in the stomach wall. With a high concentration of hydrochloric acid, gastric juice has a pH of about 2--acidic enough to dissolve iron nails. One function of the acid is to disrupt the extracellular matrix that binds cells together in meat and plant material. The acid also kills most bacteria that are swallowed with food. Also present in gastric juice is pepsin, an enzyme that begins the hydrolysis of proteins. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds adjacent to specific amino acids, cleaving proteins into smaller polypeptides. Pepsin is one of the few enzymes that works best in a strongly acidic environment. The low pH of gastric juice denatures (unfolds) the proteins in food, increasing exposure of their peptide bonds to pepsin.

What prevents pepsin from destroying the cells of the stomach wall? First, pepsin is secreted in an inactive form called pepsinogen by specialized cells called chief cells located in gastric pits (FIGURE 41.15). Other cells, called parietal cells, also in the pits, secrete hydrochloric acid. The acid converts pepsinogen to active pepsin by removing a small portion of the molecule and exposing its active site. Because different cells secrete the acid and pepsinogen, the two ingredients do not mix--and pepsinogen is not activated--until they enter the lumen of the stomach. Activation of pepsinogen is an example of positive feedback. Once some pepsinogen is activated by acid, activation occurs at an increasingly rapid rate because pepsin itself can activate additional molecules of pepsinogen. Many other digestive enzymes are also secreted in inactive forms that become active within the lumen of the digestive tract.

The stomach's second defense against self-digestion is a coating of mucus, secreted by the epithelial cells, that helps protect the stomach lining. Still, the epithelium is constantly eroded, and mitosis generates enough cells to completely replace the stomach lining every three days. Gastric ulcers, lesions in the stomach lining, are caused mainly by the acid-tolerant bacterium Helicobacter pylori and are treated with antibiotics. However, gastric ulcers may worsen if pepsin and acid destroy the lining faster than it can regenerate.

About every 20 seconds, the stomach contents are mixed by the churning action of smooth muscles. You may feel hunger pangs when your empty stomach churns. (Sensations of hunger are also associated with brain centers that monitor the blood's nutritional status.) As a result of mixing and enzyme action, what begins in the stomach as a recently swallowed meal becomes a nutrient-rich broth known as acid chyme.

Most of the time, the stomach is closed off at either end (see FIGURE 41.13). The opening from the esophagus to the stomach, the cardiac orifice, normally dilates only when a bolus driven by peristalsis arrives. The occasional backflow of acid chyme from the stomach into the lower end of the esophagus causes heartburn. (If backflow is a persistent problem, an ulcer may develop in the esophagus.) At the opening from the stomach to the small intestine is the pyloric sphincter, which helps regulate the passage of chyme into the intestine. A squirt at a time, it takes about 2 to 6 hours after a meal for the stomach to empty.





 The small intestine is the major organ of digestion and absorption

With a length of more than 6 m in humans, the small intestine is the longest section of the alimentary canal (its name is based on its small diameter, compared with the large intestine). Most of the enzymatic hydrolysis of food macromolecules and most of the absorption of nutrients into the blood occurs in the small intestine.

The first 25 cm or so of the small intestine is called the duodenum. It is here that acid chyme from the stomach mixes with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and gland cells of the intestinal wall itself (FIGURE 41.16). The pancreas produces several hydrolytic enzymes and an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate. The bicarbonate acts as a buffer, offsetting the acidity of chyme from the stomach.

Fig 41-16. The duodenum. As peristalsis squeezes the mixture of digestive juices and partially-digested food along the small intestine, hydrolytic enzymes break the food molecules down to monomers.

The liver performs a wide variety of important functions in the body, including the production of bile, a mixture of substances that is stored in the gallbladder until needed. Bile contains no digestive enzymes, but it does contain bile salts, which act as detergents that aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile also contains pigments that are by-products of red blood cell destruction in the liver; these bile pigments are eliminated from the body with the feces.

Enzymatic Action in the Small Intestine

Let's now follow the action of enzymes from the pancreas and intestinal (duodenal) wall in digesting macromolecules.

Carbohydrate Digestion. The digestion of starch and glycogen begun by salivary amylase in the oral cavity continues in the small intestine (FIGURE 41.17, p. 864). Pancreatic amylases hydrolyze starch, glycogen, and smaller polysaccharides into disaccharides. The enzyme maltase completes the digestion of maltose, splitting it into two molecules of the simple sugar glucose. Maltase is one of a family of disaccharidases, each one specific for hydrolysis of a different disaccharide. Sucrase, for instance, hydrolyzes table sugar (sucrose), and lactase digests lactose, a sugar found in milk (adults usually have much less lactase and therefore less ability to digest milk sugar than children have). The disaccharidases are built into the membranes and extracellular matrix covering the intestinal epithelium, which is also the site of sugar absorption. Thus, the terminal steps in carbohydrate digestion--the steps that yield energy-rich monomers--occur where these monomers are absorbed into the blood.

Protein Digestion. Digestion of proteins in the small intestine completes the process begun by pepsin in the stomach (FIGURE 41.17b). Several enzymes in the duodenum dismantle polypeptides into their component amino acids or into small peptides that in turn are attacked by other enzymes. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are specific for peptide bonds adjacent to certain amino acids, and thus, like pepsin, break large polypeptides into shorter chains. Enzymes called dipeptidases, attached to the intestinal lining, split small peptides. Carboxypeptidase splits off one amino acid at a time, beginning at the end of the polypeptide that has a free carboxyl group. Aminopeptidase works in the opposite direction. Either aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase alone could eventually completely digest a protein, but the teamwork among the various enzymes speeds up hydrolysis tremendously.

Many of the protein-digesting enzymes, such as aminopeptidase, are secreted by the intestinal epithelium, but trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase are secreted in inactive forms by the pancreas. Another intestinal enzyme, called enteropeptidase, directly or indirectly triggers activation of these enzymes within the intestinal lumen (FIGURE 41.18).

Fig 41-18. Activation of protein-digesting enzymes in the small intestine. The pancreas secretes protein-digesting enzymes in an inactive form into the lumen of the duodenum. An enzyme called enteropeptidase, which is bound to the intestinal epithelium, converts trypsinogen to trypsin. Trypsin then activates procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen. ( indicates activation.)

Nucleic Acid Digestion. The digestion of nucleic acids involves a hydrolytic assault similar to that mounted on proteins. A team of enzymes called nucleases hydrolyze DNA and RNA into their component nucleotides (FIGURE 41.17c). Other hydrolytic enzymes then break nucleotides down further into nucleosides, nitrogenous bases, sugars, and phosphates.

Fat Digestion. Nearly all the fat in a meal reaches the small intestine completely undigested. Hydrolysis of fats is a special problem, because fat molecules are insoluble in water. However, bile salts from the gallbladder secreted into the duodenum coat tiny fat droplets and keep them from coalescing, a process called emulsification. Because the droplets are small, a large surface area of fat is exposed to lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the fat molecules (FIGURE 41.17d).

Thus, the macromolecules from food are completely hydrolyzed to their component monomers as peristalsis moves the mixture of chyme and digestive juices along the small intestine. Most digestion is completed early in this journey, while the chyme is still in the duodenum. The remaining regions of the small intestine, the jejunum and ileum, function mainly in the absorption of nutrients and water.

Absorption of Nutrients

To enter the body, nutrients in the lumen must cross the lining of the digestive tract. A few nutrients are absorbed in the stomach and large intestine, but most absorption occurs in the small intestine. This organ has a huge surface area--300 m2, roughly the size of a tennis court. Large circular folds in the lining bear fingerlike projections called villi, and each epithelial cell of a villus has many microscopic appendages called microvilli that are exposed to the intestinal lumen. This enormous microvillar surface is an adaptation that greatly increases the rate of nutrient absorption (FIGURE 41.19).

Fig 41-19. The structure of the small intestine.

Penetrating the core of each villus is a net of microscopic blood vessels (capillaries) and a small vessel of the lymphatic system called a lacteal. (In addition to their circulatory system, vertebrates have an associated network of vessels--the lymphatic system--that carries a clear fluid called lymph, discussed in Chapter 43.) Nutrients are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium and then across the unicellular epithelium of the capillaries or lacteals. Only these two single layers of epithelial cells separate nutrients in the lumen of the intestine from the bloodstream.

In some cases, transport of nutrients across the epithelial cells is passive. The simple sugar fructose, for example, apparently moves by diffusion down its concentration gradient from the lumen of the intestine into the epithelial cells, and then into capillaries. Other nutrients, including amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and glucose and several other simple sugars, are pumped against concentration gradients by the epithelial membranes. This active transport allows the intestine to absorb a much higher proportion of the nutrients in the intestine than would be possible with passive diffusion.

Amino acids and sugars pass through the epithelium, enter capillaries, and are carried away from the intestine by the bloodstream. After glycerol and fatty acids are absorbed by epithelial cells, they are recombined into fats within those cells. The fats are then mixed with cholesterol and coated with special proteins, forming small globules called chylomicrons, most of which are transported by exocytosis out of the epithelial cells and into lacteals. The lacteals converge into the larger vessels of the lymphatic system. Lymph, containing chylomicrons, eventually drains from the lymphatic system into large veins that return blood to the heart.

In contrast to the lacteals, the capillaries and veins that drain the nutrients away from the villi all converge into the hepatic portal vessel, which leads directly to the liver. This ensures that the liver--which has the metabolic versatility to interconvert various organic molecules--has first access to amino acids and sugars absorbed after a meal is digested. There fore, blood that leaves the liver may have a very different balance of these nutrients than the blood that entered via the hepatic portal vessel. For example, the liver helps regulate the level of glucose molecules in the blood, and blood exiting the liver usually has a glucose concentration very close to 0.1% , regardless of the carbohydrate content of a meal (see FIGURE 41.1). From the liver, blood travels to the heart, which pumps the blood and the nutrients it contains to all parts of the body.

Digestive Efficiency and Cost

The digestive and absorptive processes are very effective in obtaining energy and nutrients. People eating the typical diets consumed in developed countries usually absorb 80 to 90 percent of the organic matter in their food. Much of the remaining undigestible material is cellulose from plant cell walls, and thus diets containing lots of fresh vegetables are not absorbed as completely as diets that are rich in meats, fats, or simple carbohydrates.

Because digestion and absorption depend on such active mechanisms as peristalsis, enzyme secretion, and active transport, there is a substantial energy cost to processing food. Depending on the animal species and the diet, digesting and absorbing a meal may require the animal to expend an amount of energy equal to between 3%  and 30%  of the chemical energy contained in the meal.





 Hormones help regulate digestion

Many animals go for long intervals between meals and do not need to run their digestive systems continuously. Hormones released by the wall of the stomach and duodenum help ensure that digestive secretions are present only when needed. When we see, smell, or taste food, impulses from the brain to the stomach initiate the secretion of gastric juice. Then certain substances in the food stimulate the stomach wall to release the hormone gastrin into the circulatory system. As gastrin gradually recirculates in the bloodstream back to the stomach wall, the hormone stimulates further secretion of gastric juice. Thus, an initial burst of gastric secretion at mealtime is followed by a sustained secretion that continues to add gastric juice to the food for some time. If the pH of the stomach contents becomes too low, the acid will inhibit the release of gastrin, decreasing the secretion of gastric juice; this is an example of negative feedback.

Other hormones, collectively called enterogastrones, are secreted by the wall of the duodenum. The acidic pH of the chyme that enters the duodenum stimulates cells in the wall to release the hormone secretin. This enterogastrone signals the pancreas to release bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acid chyme. A second enterogastrone, cholecystokinin (CCK), is secreted in response to the presence of amino acids or fatty acids. CCK causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the small intestine. CCK also triggers the release of pancreatic enzymes. The chyme, particularly if rich in fats, also causes the duodenum to release other enterogastrones that inhibit peristalsis in the stomach, thereby slowing down the entry of food into the small intestine.





 Reclaiming water is a major function of the large intestine

The large intestine, or colon, is connected to the small intestine at a T-shaped junction, where a sphincter (a muscular valve) controls the movement of material. One arm of the T is a pouch called the cecum (see FIGURE 41.13). Compared to many other mammals, humans have a relatively small cecum with a fingerlike extension, the appendix, which is dispens able. (Lymphoid tissue in the appendix makes a minor contribution to body defense.) The main branch of the human colon is shaped like an upside-down U about 1.5 m long.

A major function of the colon is to recover water that has entered the alimentary canal as the solvent of the various digestive juices. About 7 L of fluid are secreted into the lumen of the digestive tract each day, which is much more liquid than most people drink. Most of this water is reabsorbed along with nutrient absorption in the small intestine. The colon reclaims much of the remaining water in the lumen. Together, the small intestine and colon reabsorb about 90%  of the water that entered the alimentary canal. The wastes of the digestive tract, the feces, become more solid as they are moved along the colon by peristalsis. The movement is sluggish, and it generally takes about 12 to 24 hours for material to travel the length of the organ. If the lining of the colon is irritated--by a viral or bacterial infection, for instance--less water than normal may be reabsorbed, resulting in diarrhea. The opposite problem, constipation, occurs when peristalsis moves the feces along too slowly. An excess of water is reabsorbed, and the feces become compacted.

Living in the large intestine is a rich flora of mostly harmless bacteria. One of the common inhabitants of the human colon is Escherichia coli, a favorite research organism of molecular biologists (see Chapter 18). The presence of E. coli in lakes and streams is an indication of contamination by untreated sewage. Intestinal bacteria live on unabsorbed organic material. As by-products of their metabolism, many colon bacteria generate gases, including methane and hydrogen sulfide. Some of the bacteria produce vitamins, including biotin, folic acid, vitamin K, and several B vitamins. These vitamins, absorbed into the blood, supplement our dietary intake of vitamins.

Feces contain masses of bacteria, as well as cellulose and other undigested materials. Although cellulose fibers have no caloric value to humans, their presence in the diet helps move food along the digestive tract. Feces may also contain an abundance of salts. For instance, when iron and calcium concentrations in the blood get too high, the colon lining excretes salts of these elements into the lumen, and they are eliminated in the feces.

The terminal portion of the colon is called the rectum, where feces are stored until they can be eliminated. Between the rectum and the anus are two sphincters, one involuntary and the other voluntary. Once or more each day, strong contractions of the colon create an urge to defecate.





 Structural adaptations of digestive systems are often associated with diet

The digestive systems of mammals and other vertebrates are variations on a common plan, but there are many intriguing adaptations, often associated with the animal's diet. We will examine just a few.

Dentition, an animal's assortment of teeth, is one example of structural variation reflecting diet. Particularly in mammals, evolutionary adaptation of teeth for processing different kinds of food is one of the major reasons this vertebrate class has been so successful. Compare the dentition of carnivorous, herbivorous, and omnivorous mammals in FIGURE 41.20. Nonmammalian vertebrates generally have less specialized dentition, but there are interesting exceptions. For example, poisonous snakes, such as rattlesnakes, have fangs, modified teeth that inject venom into prey. Some fangs are hollow, like syringes, while others drip the poison along grooves on the surfaces of the teeth. All snakes have another important anatomical adaptation associated with feeding: They swallow their prey whole, with no chewing, and the lower jaw is loosely hinged to the skull by an elastic ligament that permits the mouth and throat to open very wide for swallowing impressively large prey (once again, witness the astonishing episode recorded in FIGURE 41.9). Large, expandable stomachs are common in carnivores, which may go for a long time between meals and therefore must eat as much as they can when they do catch prey. For example, a 200-kg African lion can consume 40 kg of meat in one meal.

Fig 41-20. Dentition and diet. (a) Carnivores, such as members of the dog and cat families, generally have pointed incisors and canines that can be used to kill prey and rip or cut away pieces of flesh. The jagged premolars and molars crush and shred food. (b) In contrast, herbivorous mammals, such as cows, usually have teeth with broad, ridged surfaces that grind tough plant material. The incisors and canines are generally modified for biting off pieces of vegetation. (c) Humans, being omnivores adapted for eating both vegetation and meat, have a relatively unspecialized dentition. The permanent (adult) set of teeth is 32 in number. Beginning at the midline of the upper and lower jaw are two blade-like incisors for biting, a pointed canine for tearing, two premolars for grinding, and three molars for crushing.

The length of the vertebrate digestive system is also correlated with diet. In general, herbivores and omnivores have longer alimentary canals relative to their body size than carnivores (FIGURE 41.21). Vegetation is more difficult to digest than meat because it contains cell walls. A longer tract furnishes more time for digestion and more surface area for the absorption of nutrients.

Fig 41-21. The digestive tracts of a carnivore (coyote) and a herbivore (koala) compared. Although these two mammals are about the same size, the koala's intestines are much longer, an adaptation that enhances processing of fibrous, protein-poor eucalyptus leaves from which it obtains virtually all its food and water. Extensive chewing chops the leaves into very small pieces, increasing exposure of the food to di-gestive juices. The koala's cecum--at 2 m, the longest of any animal of equivalent size--functions as a fermentation chamber where symbiotic bacteria convert the shredded leaves into a more nutritious diet.





 Symbiotic microorganisms help nourish many vertebrates

Herbivorous animals face a special challenge: much of the chemical energy in their diets is contained in the cellulose of plant cell walls, but animals do not produce enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose. Many vertebrates (as well as termites, whose wood diets are largely cellulose) solve this problem by housing large populations of symbiotic bacteria and protists in special fermetation chambers in their alimentary canals. These microorganisms do have enzymes that can digest cellulose to simple sugars and other compounds that the animal can absorb. In many cases the microorganisms can also use the sugars from digested cellulose along with minerals to make a variety of nutrients essential to the animal, such as vitamins and amino acids.

The location of symbiotic microbes in herbivores' digestive tracts varies depending on the type of animal. The hoatzin, an herbivorous bird that lives in South American rain forests, has a large, muscular crop (an esophageal pouch) that houses symbiotic microorganisms. Hard ridges in the wall of the crop grind plant leaves into small fragments, and the microorganisms break down cellulose. Many herbivorous mammals, including horses, house symbiotic microorganisms in a large cecum, the pouch where the small and large intestines connect. The symbiotic bacteria of rabbits and some rodents live in the large intestine as well as in the cecum. Since most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, nourishing by-products of fermentation by bacteria in the large intestine are initially lost with the feces. Rabbits and rodents recover these nutrients by eating some of their feces and passing the food through the alimentary canal a second time. (The familiar rabbit "pellets," which are not reingested, are the feces eliminated after food has passed through the digestive tract twice.) The koala, an Australian marsupial, also has an enlarged cecum, where symbiotic bacteria ferment finely shredded eucalyptus leaves (see FIGURE 41.21). The most elaborate adaptations for a herbivorous diet have evolved in the ruminants, which include deer, cattle, and sheep (FIGURE 41.22).

Fig 41-22. Ruminant digestion. The stomach of a ruminant has four chambers. Because of the microbial action in the chambers, the diet from which a ruminant actually absorbs its nutrients is much richer than the grass the animal originally ate. In fact, a ruminant eating grass or hay obtains many of its nutrients by digesting the symbiotic microorganisms, which reproduce rapidly enough in the rumen to maintain a stable population.

Our focus in this chapter has been on provisioning the animal body to support both metabolic production of ATP and biosynthesis. We have examined the nutritional requirements of animals and some of the many ways animals obtain nutrients for fuel and building materials. In the next chapter we will see that obtaining food, digesting it, and absorbing nutrients are only parts of a larger story. Provisioning the body also involves distributing nutrients to cells throughout the body and exchanging respiratory gases with the environment.
