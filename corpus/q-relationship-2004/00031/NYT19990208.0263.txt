-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- `` When my time comes , '' King Hussein said , `` I hope it will be like my grandfather 's -- and like Yitzhak Rabin 's .
It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband , Yitzhak , and this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem .
His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of the king .
In July 1951 , when he was just 16 , King Hussein saw his grandfather , King Abdullah , gunned down at the Al - Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to make peace between the Arabs and Israel .
For my husband 's funeral , 87 heads of state had landed at Ben - Gurion Airport .
President Bill Clinton and former Presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral .
Most of the leaders wore yarmulkes , but King Hussein wore a traditional Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh .
So moving were the king 's words : `` My sister , Mrs. Leah Rabin , my friends , I had never thought the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother , a colleague and a friend -- a man , a soldier whom we respected as he respected us .
`` You lived as a soldier , '' His Highness continued , `` you died as a soldier of peace , and I believe it is time for all of us to come out , openly , and to speak our piece , here today and for all the times to come ...
Let 's hope and pray that God will give us all guidance , each in his respective position , to do what he can for the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and courage ...
After the burial service , everyone filed past us .
I shook hands , I kissed them as they came to console us , sharing our unspeakable pain .
-0- Only two years earlier , in October 1994 , just before the final peace agreement between Jordan and Israel was signed in the Arava Desert , on the Israeli - Jordanian border , my husband Yitzhak was sitting with King Hussein in the Hashemiyah Palace in Amman .
The two were having a tete-a-tete dinner to finalize the treaty details .
Yitzhak had mentioned Col. Fawaz Maher , a dashing Jordanian officer , who used to drive a flashy sports car , and was a friend to King Hussein when he was an 18-year -old student attending the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst .
In years to come , that acquaintance grew into one of great warmth .
Col. Maher and his Turkish wife had a daughter , about one year old , and they were expecting their second child .
News traveled around the staff college that when Mrs. Maher gave birth to a second daughter , the colonel would n't even visit her at the hospital , he so deeply wanted a son .
He held her responsible .
Mrs. Maher was anguished over her situation .
I said to her that it was wonderful that she had a second daughter and she would surely have a son later .
We did n't see the colonel for about 40 years .
In the papers we would occasionally read about his steady advancement .
He became vice chief of staff of the Jordanian army and then chief of staff , then ambassador to Taiwan , the Soviet Union and Turkey .
After that news we completely lost track of him .
And so , in 1994 , Yitzhak said to the king , `` I know that he was your friend .
Whatever became of him ? ''
`` He still is my friend , '' said King Hussein with a broad smile .
Half an hour later , Maher was standing in the doorway .
In fact he had been quite sick and now walked with a cane .
Later , at the hotel reception , we hugged as though we had always been close friends .
I wanted to find out what had happened since the birth of their second daughter .
`` After our second child , my wife had two more daughters , '' he explained .
`` Then I said to my wife , ` My dear , if the fifth time it is another daughter , you will be fired .
That very week I 'll take another wife . ' ''
I know for sure that he would never have thrown her out , they loved each other so much .
In any event , their fifth and last child was a son .
Later , on a visit to the Ukraine in 1995 , we heard in Kiev that Maher had suffered a stroke .
His Majesty King Hussein sent Maher to Jerusalem 's Hadassah Hospital -- a Jewish hospital -- in his own helicopter .
Later that week , I entered Maher 's hospital room and found his wife and the fabled fifth child , Maher 's son .
The son , Ali , was 35 .
Ali was every bit as handsome as his father had been -- and , very interested in modern art , he had become head of the cultural center of Amman .
-0- On one occasion in 1970 , at a holiday reception , I encountered Andrew Mossbacher , chief of protocol in the U.S. Department of State .
We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman , and Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in honor of King Hussein of Jordan .
Two months earlier , in September 1970 -- `` Black September '' -- the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan .
Many PLO leaders -- but not Yassir Arafat -- were advocating the overthrow of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside Jordan .
King Hussein decided to strike back decisively .
Meanwhile Syria threatened to send tanks into Jordan , and the United States was concerned that the king 's government would fall .
The United States wanted to rally support for King Hussein .
Israel was the conduit to send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of Jordan , but eventually Jordan did all this by itself .
I told Mossbacher , `` Please tell King Hussein that you and I met at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards , and to say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination in his struggle with the PLO . ''
Perhaps it would n't do any good , but it certainly could do no harm .
Very early the next morning , Mossbacher phoned to say , in his deep voice , `` Mrs .
Rabin , we all have our problems .
Perhaps King Hussein has more than we do .
You made the man happy last night .
He was so excited that , when I escorted him to his car , he repeated , ` Please do n't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and best wishes . ' ''
-0- In January 1985 , about four months after taking office , Yitzhak presented his plan for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon to take place over five to six months .
By June 1985 , the withdrawal from Lebanon was complete .
As the Lebanon resolution moved forward , Yitzhak turned his focus to Jordan .
In March 1985 , he held secret talks with King Hussein in London .
He presented the king with an Israeli -made Galil assault rifle in a beautiful case made from olive wood .
It was well known that Yitzhak had met with King Hussein several times before they `` officially '' made contact in Washington in 1994 .
The first of these private meetings dated back to 1975 or 1976 .
I went with him to Eilat ; from there , he left for an undisclosed location -- it may have been at sea or in the desert .
The press got wind that something was going on .
In an Israeli newspaper , a cartoon appeared depicting Yitzhak in Eilat and King Hussein in Aqaba playing tennis across the Red Sea .
From Eilat you can see the lights of Aqaba , and vice versa .
By car , the two cities are only 10 minutes apart , but at that time , they were still worlds away .
Yitzhak had always liked King Hussein greatly and he invariably came home from their meetings with the same comment : `` It was delightful , but there were no results . ''
The reason why was simple .
The king kept saying : Everything or nothing .
And so things stayed at the point of nothing , until years later , during Yitzhak 's second term as prime minister .
-0- On July 25 , 1994 , a very hot and humid day , King Hussein , President Clinton and Yitzhak signed , on the White House lawn , a declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel and Jordan .
Just before the signing ceremony , I met King Hussein and his wife , Queen Noor al- Hussein , for the first time .
I was standing beside Vice President Gore 's wife , Tipper , when the queen and I were introduced .
The Princeton -educated queen , the daughter of an American airline executive , struck me as both articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth .
-LRB- I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the king and queen of Jordan , and Queen Noor personally served us at the table as a special gesture of respect . -RRB-
Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from all over could at long last visit Petra -- the dream of many young people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the spectacular red rock formations .
I could n't wait to see it .
`` Your Majesty , are you aware how much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra ? ''
I remember saying to Queen Noor at this first meeting .
`` And , do you know how worried we are already ? '' she replied .
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for `` storming '' tourist sites .
Months later , before the opening of an important bridge between our countries , Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra .
King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26 .
In his speech Yitzhak noted , `` Only a 70-minute journey separates these cities , Jerusalem and Amman -- and 46 years . ''
That afternoon , Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone at his hotel .
Shortly before the meeting , an unexpected message was delivered : Would Mrs. Rabin please join us ?
Of course I came along , figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I would spend time together , but I was surprised when His Majesty asked me to join the three of them .
They were to discuss the financial implications of the Israeli - Jordanian treaty .
I quickly realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues , and I was pleasantly surprised .
We spent an amiable hour together .
The Friday night after we 'd returned from our trip , we were sitting in the living room of our Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang .
It was the king calling from his airplane , en route from Washington to London , thanking Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship .
-0- On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995 , Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and Yitzhak in Aqaba .
Before the interview , we at last visited Petra .
We were a large group , including our children , and Petra was even more magnificent than I expected .
One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces .
The limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky , their fantastic shapes rich in pinks , reds and grays .
At the end of the path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink limestone .
But the real excitement was to be found in what God , not man , made .
Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra , but he may have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see Petra freely for themselves .
On June 8 , 1995 , Yitzhak appeared on Larry King 's television show on CNN , along with President Clinton , King Hussein , Shimon Peres and Yassir Arafat .
The interview reflected the rapport these men now shared .
-0- As Yitzhak walked off the speaker 's platform at the rally of Nov. 4 , 1995 , he heard the love and blessings of hundreds of thousands of voices , young and old , too long silent , now ringing out as one , urging him forward in the name of peace .
Descending the stairs to his waiting car , I am sure his thoughts , as always , turned to the hard work of the days ahead -- to Syria and beyond .
But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind littered with hate interrupted the song of his life -- and my world , our world , was never to be the same .
-0- In the months following Yitzhak 's death , the nation paid tribute by naming many structures and facilities in his memory .
On Jan. 6 , the trauma unit of Tel Aviv 's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the Rabin Trauma Unit .
King Hussein attended ; it was his first visit to Tel Aviv .
I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team , who had been by Yitzhak 's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first moment he was brought there to the very last , when they realized they could do no more .
The shock had been enormous -- to have the prime minister brought in in critical condition , trying everything possible to save him , and then having to make the decision to take him off life support and declare him dead .
I should have thanked them that night in November for their efforts , but I was dazed -- I just was not thinking at all .
Finally , in a clearer moment , I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein 's presence by quoting scripture : `` Blessed be he by coming and by leaving us on his way home . ''
