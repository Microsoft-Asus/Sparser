CANBERRA , June 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Australia will ban Japanese fishing boats from Australian ports and fishing zones following Japan 's decision to ignore international quotas on threatened Southern Bluefin Tuna .
Japan has announced it will again conduct an `` experimental fishing program '' for the tuna - the same method it used last year to take 1,400 tons or 25 percent above its quota .
Japan 's announcement has prompted an angry reaction from Australia , member of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna .
`` We believe this is totally unacceptable and we are protesting in the strongest possible terms , '' Australian Agriculture Minister Mark Vaile told reporters Tuesday .
'' -LRB- Australian -RRB- Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has called in the Japanese Ambassador this evening to express those strong concerns .
`` It is extremely disappointing .
It is flying in the face of Japan 's international obligations under the International Law of the Sea . ''
Vaile said Japan 's continued overfishing of the highly prized tuna was threatening an Australian export industry worth 110 million U.S. dollars a year .
Vaile said Australia was considering taking legal action against Japan and would pursue the issue through international forums and treaties .
