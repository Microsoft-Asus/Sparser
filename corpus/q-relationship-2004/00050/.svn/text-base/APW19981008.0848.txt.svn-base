THE HAGUE , Netherlands
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A suspected leader of Colombia 's Cali drug cartel was sentenced to six years in a Dutch jail Thursday for his involvement in cocaine smuggling .
Quiceno Botero was convicted of assisting in the transport of 240 kilos of cocaine from South America to the Netherlands in 1991 and 1992 , Dutch prosecutor Elizabeth Horstink said .
A district court also fined Botero 100,000 guilders -LRB- dlrs 55,000 -RRB- .
Although authorities believe Botero -- still wanted by U.S. authorities -- was a top leader of the notorious drug cartel , there was only enough evidence to connect him to the three failed drug shipments , Horstink said .
`` We do think we have arrested and sentenced an important person in the criminal organization , '' Horstink said .
Botero was arrested on the island of Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles last Dec. 23 while on vacation with his family .
The three shipments , which were intercepted outside the country , were intended for the Dutch market , Horstink said .
The United States has requested Botero 's extradition because he also is suspected of smuggling cocaine to the United States , but the Dutch court has not yet made a decision , she said .
