CARACAS , Venezuela --
One week he 's touring a poor neighborhood where soldiers he has ordered out of the barracks are helping build a new school for impoverished children .
The next he 's shuffling top management at one of the hemisphere 's major oil companies , sending ripples through world markets .
After that , he 's unveiling a plan to jumpstart the faltering small-business sector with a new credit agency .
Then he 's back to sparring with the country 's Congress , asserting the authority of an assembly that aims to tear up the constitution and rebuild the nation 's political institutions from scratch .
Visionary social reformer or would-be dictator : both labels have flown around Venezuela 's breathless new president , Hugo Chavez .
In a nation reeling from its worst recession in memory , in a region rumbling with turmoil Chavez has shaken things up .
After leading a failed coup attempt in 1992 , his landslide election victory last fall and break-neck first six months in office have captured the imagination of millions of Latin Americans while unsettling business interests and stirring a buzz in diplomatic circles from Washington to Buenos Aires .
`` Chavez is almost a mythical figure , '' said Carlos Sabino , a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela and longtime observer of the country 's politics .
`` He is not cultured , but he is very sharp .
He proudly calls himself ` pata en el suelo , ' which means barefoot peasant , but he wears a red beret and some people call him the Rambo of Venezuela .
He is strong but humble .
He is an intuitive political animal . ''
Where Chavez takes his country of 23 million residents is a matter of keen interest for Latin America -watchers .
After a wave of oil-fueled economic progress in the 1980s that was accompanied by a shift toward free elections and away from oppressive dictatorships , the region has plunged back into uncertainty .
`` It 's an experiment-in-the-making that 's very important for all of Latin America , '' said Jennifer McCoy , a Georgia State University political scientist and director of the Carter Center 's Latin American programs .
`` I think Chavez sincerely wants to help the people and to create a democracy that is more responsive and participatory .
The risk is that if you rely too heavily on a large mandate and popularity , you can lose sight of the checks and balances that ensure power is shared among the different levels and branches of government . ''
Several top Venezuelan officials were scheduled to meet with Carter Center officials Sept. 17 -LRB- CQ -RRB- in Atlanta to discuss their effort to draw up a new constitution .
Earlier in the week , the delegation also was to meet with officials from the United Nations , the U.S. Congress and Chase Manhattan Bank in an effort to counter what they feel has been a wave of critical media reports about the situation in Venezuela .
`` The idea is to provide them with the effective reality of what is happening here and not the distorted -LRB- reality -RRB- that has been published in some cases , '' Luis Miquilena , head of the National Constitutional Assembly , told reporters here in Caracas before departing for the trip .
U.S. officials have expressed concern over the country 's political instability , with a State Department spokesman urging the preservation of democracy in Venezuela `` in substance as well as in form . ''
Concerns peaked earlier this month when members of the Assembly -- a body elected in July and salted heavily with Chavez supporters -- clashed with the nation 's Congress .
After a series of Assembly decrees left the Congress nearly powerless , tensions flared as frustrated members of the Congress scaled the fence to get back into the building from which they had been barred .
An uneasy truce emerged on Sept. 10 when the two bodies reached an agreement brokered by the Catholic Church .
The Congress will be allowed to reconvene in October , while the Assembly will concentrate on writing the new constitution , which could go to voters for approval as early as December .
Elections for a new Congress would presumably be held shortly thereafter .
Through all the upheaval , Chavez has maintained his stunning popularity , with opinion polls showing a consistent 70 percent approval rating .
Observers say his message of cleaning up a notoriously corrupt political system and sharing the nation 's abundant oil wealth with the people has struck a profound chord with a populace frustrated by a near 30-year decline in prosperity .
But things have gotten worse since Chavez took office .
In recent months , unemployment has skyrocketed to 20 percent , with some estimating it may soar to 50 percent by the end of the year .
Economic output has shrunk dramatically , declining nearly 10 percent in the first half of 1999 , while foreign investment has dropped sharply .
`` Our state is very rich , but our government in the past has behaved as if it were the owners of these riches , not the administrators , '' said Vicente Britos , head of Fedecamaras , the national association of Venezuelan Chambers of Commerce .
`` The government has an obligation to guarantee that a considerable amount of these riches are transferred to the people . ''
Chavez , 45 , has built his political career on a promise to do just that .
Raised in Venezuela 's interior , a rugged region of cattle farms , he came from a family of poor schoolteachers .
He made his career in the military , rising to the rank of colonel in a paratroop division .
His coup attempt in 1992 ended in failure and he was jailed for two years .
After his release , he quietly began barnstorming the countryside , hammering away about the need to toss out the corrupt system built by the two political parties that have dominated Venezuelan politics since the first free elections in 1958 .
The message proved wildly popular .
Venezuelans , who elected Chavez in a landslide last November , are outraged that their resource-rich country now suffers widespread poverty , with some estimates showing as much as 80 percent of the population below the poverty level .
The government , meanwhile , has become bloated with more than a million employees , with rampant corruption at all levels .
Many agencies reportedly have no record of where their appropriations go , while bureaucratic red-tape strangles attempts to start new industries .
There is a widespread belief that crooked politicians have frittered away the nation 's wealth .
`` People want a savior , a magical solution , and that 's what Chavez offers , '' said Sabino .
`` But that 's where the contradictions lie .
Chavez is a populist , a leftist , but he understands he must have a strong economy and foreign investment , and he ca n't get these without the facade of democracy . ''
Chavez , who took office in February , adamantly insists he has no designs to set himself up as a dictator .
`` No one here can say they are persecuted -- absolutely no one -- by the government , '' he told reporters recently .
Many observers have compared Chavez to Peru 's President Alberto Fujimori , who swept to power in a crisis-wracked country in the early 1990s , tossing out the existing government with army backing .
But some draw distinctions .
`` The difference is that Chavez , after failing to take power illegally by a coup , has come back legally through elections , '' McCoy said .
`` I think he is a new model .
He has an elected constitutional assembly that is asserting its powers . ''
Critics fear the assembly is little more than a rubber-stamp , and that Chavez is moving toward an authoritarian regime .
He has proposed expanding the president 's term to six years and allowing a second term .
There is also concern over some of his rhetoric and friendships : <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Chavez appears to have close ties to Cuba 's Fidel Castro </ENAMEX>, and has invited Iraq 's Saddam Hussein and Libya 's Moammar Ghaddafi to an oil summit in Venezuela next year .
He even penned a friendly letter to an infamous Venezuelan -born terrorist , `` Carlos the Jackal , '' who is serving a life term in a French prison .
But any missteps perceived abroad are lost on Venezuelan voters , many of whom seem captivated by Chavez 's whirlwind pace working for what he calls a `` peaceful revolution . ''
He has cut government spending , put the army to work on social programs , and solidified his populist image with moves like getting rid of the presidential limousine and turning over his $ 1,200-a-month salary to a scholarship fund .
`` We are n't going to raise the flag of tyranny , '' he has told reporters .
`` Our intention is to rebuild institutions , to strengthen democracy .
We respect our adversaries and their ideas .
We respect liberties .
We persecute no one . ''
But just how long Chavez 's popularity will hold up in the face of the economic crisis remains to be seen .
`` People have hopes , high hopes , and they will give him a chance for a time , '' said Sabino , the sociologist .
`` But how much longer people can bear the situation I do n't know .
I think we will know when the new constitution is in place .
By the spring we will know which way Chavez really will take us . ''
