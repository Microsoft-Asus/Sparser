This is especially important for animal cells, which lack walls. The remarkable strength and resilience of the cytoskeleton as a whole is based on its architecture. Like a geodesic dome, the cytoskeleton is stabilized by a balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements. And just as the skeleton of an animal helps fix the positions of other body parts, the cytoskeleton provides anchorage for many organelles and even cytosolic enzyme molecules. The cytoskeleton is more dynamic than an animal skeleton, however. It can be quickly dismantled in one part of the cell and reassembled in a new location, changing the shape of the cell.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The cytoskeleton is also involved in several types of cell motility (movement). The term <span class="Emphasis1">cell motility</span> encompasses both changes in cell location and more limited movements of parts of the cell. Cell motility generally requires the interaction of the cytoskeleton with proteins called motor molecules (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.21</span>). Examples of such cell motility abound. Motor molecules of the cytoskeleton bring about the movements of cilia and flagella by allowing components of the cytoskeleton to slide past each other. The same mechanism causes muscle cells to contract. Vesicles often travel to their destinations in the cell along "monorails" provided by the cytoskeleton. For example, as discussed in the interview with George Langford (pp. 106-107), this is how vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules migrate to the tips of axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that release these molecules as chemical signals to adjacent nerve cells. It is the cytoskeleton that manipulates the plasma membrane to form food vacuoles during phagocytosis. The streaming of cytoplasm that circulates materials within many large plant cells is yet another kind of cellular movement brought about by components of the cytoskeleton.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-21','../fig/big/fig7-21.jpg','fig7-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-21.jpg" alt="fig7-21" name="myfig7-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Motor molecules and the cytoskeleton.</span> The microtubules and microfilaments of the cytoskeleton function in motility by interacting with proteins called motor molecules.

Mounting evidence suggests that the cytoskeleton can transmit mechanical forces from the surface of the cell to its interior--and even, via other fibers, into the nucleus. In one experiment, investigators used a micromanipulation device to pull on certain plasma membrane proteins attached to the cytoskeleton. A video microscope captured almost instantaneous rearrangements of nucleoli and other structures in the nucleus. In this way, the transmission of naturally occurring mechanical signals by the cytoskeleton may help regulate cell function.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Now let’s look more closely at the three main types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton (TABLE 7.2). <span class="Emphasis2">Microtubules</span> are the thickest of the three types; <span class="Emphasis2">microfilaments</span> (also called actin filaments) are the thinnest; and <span class="Emphasis2">intermediate filaments</span> are fibers with diameters in a middle range.</p><TABLE BORDER="0"><TR><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1"><B>Table 7-2.</B>&nbsp;<span class="table_title">The Structure and Function of the Cytoskeleton</span><BR></TH></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="5"><TR><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Property</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Microtubules</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Microfilaments (Actin Filaments)</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Intermediate Filaments</TH></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Structure</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Hollow tubes; wall consists of 13 columns of tubulin molecules</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Two intertwined strands of actin</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Fibrous proteins supercoiled into thicker cables</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Diameter</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">25 nm with 15-nm lumen</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">7 nm</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">8-12 nm</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Protein subunits</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Tubulin, consisting of <span class="symbol">a</span>-tubulin and <span class="symbol">b</span>-tubulin</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Actin</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">One of several different proteins of the keratin family, depending on cell type</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Main functions</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Maintenance of cell shape (compression-resisting "girders")</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Maintenance of cell shape (tension-bearing elements)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Maintenance of cell shape (tension-bearing elements)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Cell motility (as in cilia or flagella)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Changes in cell shape</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Anchorage of nucleus and certain other organelles</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Chromosome movements in cell division</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Muscle contraction</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Formation of nuclear lamina</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Organelle movements</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Cytoplasmic streaming</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Cell motility (as in pseudopodia)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Cell division (cleavage furrow formation)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"></P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="4" ROWSPAN=""><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../img/ufg/UFIG7-4.jpg" border="0" alt="" name="myUFIG7-4.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1"></td></tr></table></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="4" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">SOURCE: Adapted from W.

The wall of the hollow tube is constructed from a globular protein called tubulin. Each tubulin molecule is a dimer consisting of two slightly different polypeptide subunits, <span class="symbol">a</span>-tubulin and <span class="symbol">b</span>-tubulin. A microtubule grows in length by adding tubulin dimers to its ends. Microtubules can be disassembled and their tubulin used to build microtubules elsewhere in the cell.</p><a name="para43"></a><p class="BlockText">Microtubules shape and support the cell and also serve as tracks along which organelles equipped with motor molecules can move (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.21</span>). For example, microtubules guide secretory vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Microtubules are also responsible for the separation of chromosomes during cell division (see Chapter 12).</p><a name="para44"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Centrosomes and Centrioles.</span> In many cells, microtubules grow out from a <span class="Emphasis2">centrosome,</span> a region often located near the nucleus.

Many unicellular eukaryotic organisms are propelled through water by cilia or flagella, and the sperm of animals, algae, and some plants are flagellated. If cilia or flagella extend from cells that are held in place as part of a tissue layer, they function to move fluid over the surface of the tissue. For example, the ciliated lining of the windpipe sweeps mucus containing trapped debris out of the lungs (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.2</span>).</p><a name="para46"></a><p class="BlockText">Cilia usually occur in large numbers on the cell surface.

A cilium or flagellum has a core of microtubules sheathed in an extension of the plasma membrane (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.24</span>). Nine doublets of microtubules, the members of each pair sharing part of their walls, are arranged in a ring. In the center of the ring are two single microtubules. This arrangement, referred to as the "9 + 2" pattern, is found in nearly all eukaryotic flagella and cilia. (The flagella of motile prokaryotes, which will be discussed in Chapter 27, are entirely different.) Flexible "wheels" of proteins, evenly spaced along the length of the cilium or flagellum, connect the outer doublets to each other and to the two central microtubules (note the radial spokes in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.24c</span>). Each outer doublet also has pairs of side-arms spaced along its length and reaching toward the neighboring doublet; these are motor molecules. The microtubule assembly of a cilium or flagellum is anchored in the cell by a <span class="Emphasis2">basal body,</span> which is structurally identical to a centriole.

A dynein arm performs a complex cycle of movements caused by changes in the conformation of the protein, with ATP providing the energy for these changes.</p><a name="para50"></a><p class="BlockText">The mechanics of dynein "walking" are reminiscent of a cat climbing a tree by attaching its claws, moving its legs, releasing its front claws, and grabbing again farther up the tree. Similarly, the dynein arms of one doublet attach to an adjacent doublet and pull so that the doublets slide past each other in opposite directions. The arms then release from the other doublet and reattach a little farther along its length. Without any restraints on the movement of the microtubule doublets, one doublet would continue to "walk" along the surface of the other, elongating the cilium or flagellum rather than bending it (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.21a</span>). For lateral movement of a cilium or flagellum, the dynein "walking" must have something to pull against, as when the muscles in your leg pull against your bones to move your knee. In cilia and flagella, the microtubule doublets seem to be held in place by the protein cross-links between the doublets, the radial spokes, and the other structural elements. Thus, neighboring doublets cannot slide past each other very far. Instead, the forces exerted by the dynein arms cause the doublets to curve, bending the cilium or flagellum (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.25</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-25','../fig/big/fig7-25.jpg','fig7-25');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-25.jpg" alt="fig7-25" name="myfig7-25"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-25.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">How dynein "walking" moves cilia and flagella.</span> Powered by ATP, the dynein arms of one microtubule doublet grip the adjacent doublet, pull, release, and then grip again.

Microfilaments seem to be present in all eukaryotic cells.</p><a name="para52"></a><p class="BlockText">In contrast to the compression-resisting role of microtubules, the structural role of microfilaments in the cytoskeleton is to bear tension (pulling forces). In combination with other proteins, they often form a three-dimensional network just inside the plasma membrane, helping support the cell’s shape. This network gives the cortex (outer cytoplasmic layer) of such a cell the semisolid consistency of a gel, in contrast with the more fluid (sol) state of the interior cytoplasm. In animal cells specialized for transporting materials across the plasma membrane, bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli, delicate projections that increase the cell surface area (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.26</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-26','../fig/big/fig7-26.jpg','fig7-26');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-26.jpg" alt="fig7-26" name="myfig7-26"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-26.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A structural role of microfilaments.</span> The surface area of this nutrient-absorbing intestinal cell is increased by its many microvilli, cellular extensions reinforced by bundles of microfilaments.

Thousands of actin filaments are arranged parallel to one another along the length of a muscle cell, interdigitated with thicker filaments made of a protein called <span class="Emphasis2">myosin</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.27a</span>). Myosin acts as a motor molecule by means of projections (arms) that "walk" along the actin filaments. Contraction of the muscle cell results from the actin and myosin filaments sliding past one another in this way, shortening the cell. In other kinds of cells, actin filaments are associated with myosin in miniature and less elaborate versions of the arrangement in muscle cells. These actin-myosin aggregates are responsible for localized contractions of cells. For example, a contracting belt of microfilaments forms a cleavage furrow that pinches a dividing animal cell into two daughter cells.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-27','../fig/big/fig7-27.jpg','fig7-27');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-27.jpg" alt="fig7-27" name="myfig7-27"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-27.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Microfilaments and motility.</span> In the three examples shown in this figure, cell nuclei and most other organelles have been omitted.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para54"></a><p class="BlockText">Localized contraction brought about by actin and myosin also plays a role in amoeboid movement (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.27b</span>), in which a cell crawls along a surface by extending and flowing into cellular extensions called <span class="Emphasis2">pseudopodia</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">pseudes,</span> false, and <span class="Emphasis1">pod,</span> foot). Pseudopodia extend and contract through the reversible assembly of actin subunits into microfilaments and of microfilaments into networks that convert cytoplasm from sol to gel. According to a widely accepted model, filaments near the cell’s trailing end interact with myosin, causing contraction. Like squeezing on a toothpaste tube, this contraction forces the interior fluid into the pseudopodium, where the actin network has been weakened. The pseudopodium extends until the actin reassembles into a network. Not only do amoebas move by crawling, but so do many cells in the animal body, such as white blood cells.</p><a name="para55"></a><p class="BlockText">In plant cells, both actin-myosin interactions and sol-gel transformations brought about by actin may be involved in <span class="Emphasis2">cytoplasmic streaming,</span> a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.27c</span>). This movement, which is especially common in large plant cells, speeds the distribution of materials within the cell.</p><p class="Header3">Intermediate Filaments</p><a name="para56"></a><p class="BlockText">Intermediate filaments are named for their diameter, which, at 8-12 nm, is larger than the diameter of microfilaments but smaller than that of microtubules (see TABLE 7.2 and <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.26</span>). Specialized for bearing tension (like microtubules), intermediate filaments are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements. Each type is constructed from a different molecular subunit belonging to a family of proteins called keratins. Microtubules and microfilaments, in contrast, are consistent in diameter and composition in all eukaryotic cells.</p><a name="para57"></a><p class="BlockText">Intermediate filaments are more permanent fixtures of cells than are microfilaments and microtubules, which are often disassembled and reassembled in various parts of a cell. Chemical treatments that remove microfilaments and microtubules from the cytoplasm leave a web of intermediate filaments that retains its original shape. Such experiments suggest that intermediate filaments are especially important in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain organelles. For example, the nucleus commonly sits within a cage made of intermediate filaments, fixed in location by branches of the filaments that extend into the cytoplasm. Other intermediate filaments make up the nuclear lamina that lines the interior of the nuclear envelope (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.9</span>). In cases where the shape of the entire cell is correlated with function, intermediate filaments support that shape. For instance, the long extensions (axons) of nerve cells that transmit impulses are strengthened by one class of intermediate filament. The various kinds of intermediate filaments may function as the framework of the entire cytoskeleton.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
