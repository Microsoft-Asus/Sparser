INCHON , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL"> It 's hard to imagine a loftier marketing spin for `` Hanmaum , '' or `` One Mind , '' a new cigarette that blends tobacco from both sides of the divided Korean peninsula .
The plug ?
Get a dose of solidarity as well as nicotine .
On a dock , South Korean partners in a joint venture with communist North Korea dutifully puffed their product on Wednesday , when the first containers of `` One Mind '' arrived by ship from the North , where they are made .</ENAMEX>
`` North Koreans and South Koreans feel together when they smoke the same brand , '' declared Lee Sang -ik , spokesman for the Seoul -based Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. A yearning for reconciliation -- and publicity -- is not the only motive behind South Korean firms ' pursuit of deals in the North , an often belligerent country where roads and power grids are decrepit , food shortages are rife , payoffs are many and legal guarantees are few .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Though for now South Korean companies are vying for low returns on restricted turf in North Korea , they are looking years , or even decades , ahead to reunification and full access to a country rich in minerals and cheap labor .</ENAMEX>
Tensions between the two Koreas , which fought a war 50 years ago , could derail the ventures at any time .
Yet , at their government 's urging , entrepreneurs in the South are struggling for footholds in the North .
`` The scale of it all is basically very small , '' said Aidan Foster - Carter , a Korea expert at Leeds University in Britain .
`` It 's a tiny proportion of South Korea 's total trade . ''
North - South trade reached a record $ 340 million last year , a 50 percent increase over 1998 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">More than 100 and medium-sized South Korean companies are dealing with the North , according to South Korean President Kim Dae -jung .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The South is the North 's third-largest trading partner after China and Japan .</ENAMEX>
Kim is pursuing economic , cultural and other links with a grudging Pyongyang , a policy that could reduce the risk of conflict by fostering North Korea 's dependence on the neighbor it vilifies .
By some estimates , the North 's economy shrank by one-half or more during the 1990s , after the collapse of trading partners in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe .
Deadly famine forced it to appeal for outside food aid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hyundai , South Korea 's largest conglomerate , runs the flagship venture in the North : a $ 942 million project that sends cruise ship tours to North Korea 's Diamond Mountain , a scenic mountain range just north of the Demilitarized Zone .
Hyundai pays $ 8 million a month to Pyongyang for the tours and is losing money on the venture .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Samsung , another South Korean conglomerate , won approval from Seoul this month for a $ 727,000 project to develop computer software with a North Korean partner .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The troubled Daewoo conglomerate runs a textile factory there .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In February , a South Korean motor company owned by the Unification Church of Rev. Sun Myung Moon inaugurated an auto plant near Pyongyang .</ENAMEX>
Moon , 80 , and Hyundai founder Chung Ju Yung , 84 , were born in what is now North Korea .
It is unclear whether their successors would pursue their ventures with similar passion .
Labor in North Korea is cheap , but workers long used to a command economy are unaccustomed to the ways of the capitalist South .
`` If they discover a problem in the plant , they tend to shy away from it , '' said Oh Byong -kwon , the South Korean chief of a plant near Diamond Mountain where 60 North Korean workers started bottling water this month .
`` If we complain , they smile meekly and say they did not tell us about the problem because they were so sorry , '' Oh said .
His employees are also often called away by North Korean officials for ideological classes or community work .
In the 1990 's , the North has made some mild market reforms and opened a free economic zone .
Critics , however , view these efforts as halfhearted , a sign of the regime 's suspicion of any change that could sabotage its authority .
A trickle of European firms have dealt with Pyongyang .
The American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul wants to send a delegation to the North after the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions in September .
But decaying infrastructure will likely deter investment as much as political uncertainty and an antiquated command economy .
One South Korean businessman described how the lights went out while he talked to government officials in a top Pyongyang hotel .
The unfazed hosts fetched lanterns and the meeting resumed .
As for `` One Mind '' cigarettes , most North Koreans will never get a chance to try them : In the North , they will only be sold for U.S. dollars in hotels and other places visited by foreigners .
