ATHENS --
To the delight of Greek leftists , President Clinton Wednesday delayed and shortened his upcoming trip here to avoid potentially violent demonstrations against his visit .
`` The development in the Clinton visit is beneficial and not a detriment to the real national interests , '' said the Communist Party in a statement Wednesday .
`` It gives the Greek people the strength to intensify its demonstrations so that the US recognizes the people 's sentiment . ''
The party said the Greek government should `` not have free rein to follow the commands of Bill Clinton . ''
But the announcement caused an uproar , and many blamed the Greek government for failing to find a way to ensure Clinton 's safety while honoring the right of its citizens to demonstrate .
`` The postponement and downgrading of the visit by the American president to Greece is a blow for the international prestige of our country at the moment , '' said Stephanos Manos , leader of Greece 's Liberal Party .
`` This unfortunate development , in which extremists have seized control of the foreign policy agenda , should never have been permitted to transpire , '' said John Sitilides , executive director of the Washington -based Western Policy Center .
`` Greece 's national interests have been undermined by this irrational and reckless hostility to the US president , at least in the short term . ''
Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday for an 11-day trip to Greece , Turkey , Bulgaria , Italy , and possibly Kosovo .
But after talks between the Greek and US governments over security concerns , the White House opted to leave Sunday and cram his time in Greece into a one-day stopover next week .
The delay is meant to avoid having Clinton in Greece on or before Nov. 17 , a traditional day of protest by Greek communists and other leftists .
The date commemorates a student uprising against the Greek military junta , which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 with the tacit support of the US government .
Greek officials insist that the schedule shuffle had more to do with a US agenda that included issues the Greeks were not prepared to discuss .
The Greek press speculated that Clinton administration officials panicked at the possibility that violent protesters would get close to Clinton .
The Greeks `` asked me to do it .
Whether the demonstrations had anything to do with it , I do n't know , but they might have , '' Clinton told reporters .
`` But I 'm not bothered by it .
It 's going to happen , and you all get to take picture of it . ''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to discuss specific security threats .
He said the Greek government believed the visit would be more productive if it occurred after Clinton visits Turkey to attend a conference of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe .
For many Greeks , the shortening of the trip was an embarrassment .
As the only European Union and NATO member in the Balkan peninsula , Greece stands out as the most stable and US -friendly nation in an otherwise volatile and troubled region .
`` Everyone around us is going to give him a warm welcome , but in Greece we again have to do it differently , '' said commentator Nikos Kakaounakis .
Others talked of a `` fiasco '' that will have negative implications for Greece in the future .
Delaying the visit until next week spares Clinton some of the embarrassment of a hostile reception by the Greek people , most of whom strongly opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia .
While Greece is an ally and fellow NATO member , simmering hostility toward the US has long made it a dangerous place for US diplomats and officials .
Many Greeks believe Washington looked the other way when Turkey invaded and divided the island of Cyprus in 1974 .
