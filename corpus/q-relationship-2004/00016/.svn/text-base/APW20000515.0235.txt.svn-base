UNITED NATIONS
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- With Ethiopia and Eritrea engaged in heavy fighting , the United States introduced a Security Council resolution Monday calling for an arms embargo against the warring Horn of Africa neighbors .
But Russia strongly objected .
The council met Monday afternoon to follow up on the resolution it adopted Friday calling for `` immediate steps '' to be taken if the two countries did n't immediately cease hostilities and resume stalled peace talks .
But there was no agreement on what steps to take , and experts from the 15 nations on the council were scheduled to meet Tuesday morning to try to reach consensus on a resolution .
`` We are deeply concerned about the cost of human life to this conflict and want to see it brought to an end as soon as possible , '' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said .
There were signs that both sides might be prepared to return to the indirect peace talks in Algeria organized by the Organization of African Unity which broke down earlier this month .
Soderberg said Eritrea sent a letter to the Security Council president accepting Friday 's U.N. resolution .
Ethiopia 's U.N. ambassador sent the council an OAU communique .
It quoted Ethiopia 's prime minister as saying the government remains ready , if invited by the OAU , `` to pursue peace '' and restart the talks -- but it made no mention of the U.N. resolution .
Despite the letters , Ethiopia 's offensive in the disputed northern Badme region continued unabated Monday , and thousands of Ethiopians protested Monday against the possibility of sanctions .
The U.S. resolution calls for a total arms embargo on both countries which would be lifted when a final peace agreement has been signed .
It would ban all countries and their nationals from selling or supplying arms or training personnel from either country .
The resolution would also impose a travel ban on senior officials of the Ethiopian government .
It would be lifted once Secretary - General Kofi Annan reports to the council that the Ethiopian government `` has ceased offensive military activities against the government of Eritrea . ''
The rival Russian resolution makes no mention of sanctions , calling instead on both parties to cooperate with the OAU .
Diplomats said there was fairly wide interest in the U.S. draft , but France wanted a time frame for any arms embargo .
