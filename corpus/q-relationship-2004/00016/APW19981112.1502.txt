BAGHDAD , Iraq
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
As the crisis over U.N. arms inspections deepens , Iraq lashed out at Washington , accusing President Bill Clinton of blocking the completion of arms inspections needed for punishing trade sanctions on Iraq to be lifted `` The road is being blocked continuously , stubbornly , illegally by his government , '' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz -- gesturing defiantly , his voice rising in anger -- said Thursday at a news conference that came shortly after a group of Arab states said Iraq itself would be at fault if the U.S. military struck at the country .
The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Iraq 's vulnerable neighbors -- along with Syria and Egypt was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
Foreign ministers of the eight states , meeting in the Gulf state of Qatar , did urge `` wisdom and reason '' to end the confrontation .
But they said the government of Saddam Hussein would be `` responsible for any consequences '' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons inspectors .
Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs .
`` If they are sincere in dealing with this situation ... they should blame the main block , the main government which is behind this crisis .
They should criticize the United States , '' he said .
In nearby Israel , the government opened gas mask distribution centers for its citizens even as officials said they believed the possibility of an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel , like those during the Gulf War , was slim .
Iraq 's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the United States was preparing to make good on its military threats unless searches for Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction are renewed .
`` We 're not playing games , '' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said .
But he also said , `` We 're not seeking to go to war .
We 're seeking to avoid it .
All he has to do is comply .
The choice is his . ''
The United States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to the Gulf to prepare for an attack , and the United Nations -- declaring that it must look to the safety of its workers -- pulled 21 more staff members out of Iraq on Thursday .
The U.N. pullback began Wednesday .
All arms inspectors and one-third of the 450 humanitarian workers have left the country , with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the effectiveness of programs to help Iraq 's 22 million people .
Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate with arms inspectors , but only if it had guarantees from the U.N. Security Council that it would lead to lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a U.N. offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections -- as one step toward lifting the sanctions -- by refusing to include even a reference to the eight-year -old trade embargo .
Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the dispute was not being pushed by the United States .
`` This is the international community and the United Nations as a whole versus Iraq , '' he said .
`` If the Iraqi authorities do n't understand that , they 've missed a very important dimension of what 's going on here . ''
The sanctions , which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its economy , cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its lethal weapons .
This was required under the cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War .
Aziz complained that after more than seven years of working with U.N. inspectors , sanctions were not reduced or lifted .
Iraq 's people were not worried about a possible strike , he said .
`` They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and equipment or they die by American bombs , '' he said .
`` For the Iraqi people it makes no difference . ''
Aziz said that U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan was `` the best person '' to try to ease the current crisis , as he did the last one in February with a pledge to work toward an end to the sanctions .
Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and returned to New York on Thursday afternoon , saying he plans to meet with the Security Council on Friday but has no plans to fly to Baghdad to mediate .
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said Aziz 's comments were discouraging .
`` This is a very serious confrontation by Iraq of the Security Council , and I do n't see any diplomatic solution around as we speak tonight , '' he told MSNBC on Thursday night .
`` There 's a growing sense that airstrikes or enforcement is becoming more and more likely . ''
