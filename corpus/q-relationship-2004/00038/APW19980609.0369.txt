SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The plunge of the Japanese yen could derail South Korea 's efforts to revive its ailing economy by boosting exports , the central Bank of Korea said in a report released Tuesday .
The yen plummeted to 141.11 against the dollar at one point Tuesday , a seven-year low .
The news jolted the Korean stock market , where the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell by 6.66 percent .
The yen recovered later in the day , hitting 140.36 yen to the dollar in late afternoon in Tokyo .
A falling yen means more competition for South Korean exports as Japanese goods become cheaper overseas .
The two countries share many of their key exports items such as cars , computer chips and home appliances .
`` If the Japanese yen continues to stay weak , which is quite likely ... it will seriously weaken South Korea 's export competitiveness , '' the Bank of Korea said .
South Korea 's main strategy to survive its financial crisis has been to use its own weak currency to dramatically boost its exports .
But the falling yen all but dashed such hope , the bank said .
It estimated that when the Japanese yen falls by 10 percent , South Korea 's annual exports would decrease by dlrs 1.2 billion .
South Korea 's car and computer chip makers are already struggling under mounds of unsold products .
Domestic car sales dropped by half this year .
And Hyundai , Daewoo , Kia and other auto manufacturers exported 140,322 cars in May , down 0.7 percent from a year ago , the Korea Automobile Manufacturers ' Association said .
South Korean semiconductor makers , which supply 40 percent of the world 's computer memory chips , are planning to cut production to bolster plunging prices .
Hyundai Electronics Co. suspended chip production for the last week while Samsung Electronics Co. , the world 's biggest computer memory chip maker , will follow suit next week .
Cheap prices have been the key competitiveness of South Korean goods abroad .
