Logging and clearing for urban development, mining, and farming have reduced large tracts of forests to small patches of disconnected woodlots in many parts of the United States and throughout Europe. Similarly, agricultural development has disrupted what were once the vast grasslands of the North American prairie. After forests are clear-cut and left alone, weedy and shrubby vegetation often colonizes the area and dominates it for many years. This type of vegetation is also found extensively in agricultural fields that are no longer under cultivation and in vacant lots and construction sites that are periodically cleared. Human disturbance of communities is by no means limited to the United States and Europe; nor is it a recent problem. Tropical rain forests are quickly disappearing as a result of clear-cutting for lumber and pastureland. And centuries of overgrazing and agricultural disturbance have contributed to the current famine in parts of Africa by turning seasonal grasslands into great barren areas.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Human disturbance usually reduces species diversity in communities. We currently use about 60%  of Earth’s land in one way or another, mostly as cropland, forest, and rangeland. Most crops are grown in monocultures, intensive cultivations of a single plant variety over large areas. Even forests used to produce pulpwood and lumber are often replanted in single-species stands. And the effects of intensive grazing on rangelands often include the removal of several native plant species and replacement with only a few introduced species. In Chapter 55, we will take a closer look at how community disturbance by human activities is affecting the diversity of life.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
