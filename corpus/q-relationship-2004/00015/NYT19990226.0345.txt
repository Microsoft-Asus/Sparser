WASHINGTON --
The Clinton administration Friday certified Mexico as a cooperating partner in the war on illegal drugs despite a decline in cocaine seizures , an increase in opium poppy production and chronic corruption in the Mexican judicial system .
Clinton 's decision , which spares the United States ' southern neighbor and 25 other drug-problem nations from various U.S. economic sanctions , quickly drew criticism from congressional skeptics and prompted lawmakers to consider overturning his findings .
The president 's certification of Mexico `` does not change the facts -- drug trafficking is worse than ever , '' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas .
While the administration describes Mexico , which shares a 2,000-mile border with the United States , as the `` main transit and distribution hub for drugs , '' Clinton defended the anti-narcotic efforts of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo .
`` He is working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers have wrought , '' Clinton told a group of California business leaders whose enthusiasm during the president 's speech waned when he endorsed Zedillo 's drug-fighting efforts .
`` He cannot win this battle alone , '' Clinton said .
`` And neither can we . ''
Also certified as a drug-war ally was Colombia , which along with Mexico , dominates the illicit drug trade in the Western Hemisphere , according to an administration report issued in conjunction with the certifications by Clinton .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Only two countries , Burma and Afghanistan , the world 's leading producers of heroin , were `` decertified , '' a classification that imposes U.S. aid and trade sanctions .
Neither country was certified in 1998 .</ENAMEX>
It was the first time in four years that Colombia was certified , although it has received security waivers .
Four countries -- Cambodia , Haiti , Nigeria and Paraguay , -- were determined by the administration as not cooperating in the drug war , but Clinton urged that any penalties be waived because of U.S. national interests .
Since 1986 , federal law has required the president each year to assess the performance of drug-producing and shipping countries by March 1 .
Countries not certified as fully cooperating and not given a national security waiver are then deprived of U.S. aid , other than drug-fighting funds .
In addition , the law requires the United States to impose trade sanctions and oppose loans to those countries by international financial institutions .
The annual review is resented by the countries under scrutiny and is criticized by anti-drug groups and members of Congress as ineffective and driven more by politics than performance in the drug war .
`` We feel that certification does not help the joint fight against the common enemy .
Certification does not help , and blaming each other does not help .
Those that benefit are the drug traffickers , '' said Eduardo Ibarrola , an assistant attorney general in Mexico .
`` We are battling corruption because it is our commitment and responsibility , not because another government tells us to do so . ''
Members of the U.S. Congress were harsher about Clinton 's assessment , but for other reasons .
`` Certification and decertification have no meaning against a backdrop of rampant corruption in Mexico and the drug epidemic on America 's streets , '' said Hutchison , who is working with a bipartisan group of senators on legislation to bolster bilateral drug-fighting agreements between the United States and other countries .
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R - Miss. , said he was troubled by Clinton 's certification of Mexico `` because they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing on the drug wars . ''
In a statement issued by his office , Lott said he plans to bring up Mexico 's certification and `` ask the Senate , ` is it time to say no , you do not get recertified . ' ''
Rep. John Mica , a Florida Republican who chairs the House subcommittee on drug policy , said he is `` disgusted that the administration would whitewash a situation in which an adjacent nation is on the verge of a takeover by narcotics interests and attempt to lull the Congress into complacency on the issue . ''
To reverse any decision by Clinton to certify a nation as a drug-war ally , a two-thirds vote would be required by both the Senate and the House .
Even Democrats were critical of the president 's certification of Mexico .
`` After evaluating the evidence ...
I have reluctantly concluded that Mexico has not made progress in effectively combatting the drug trade , '' said House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri .
`` The law requires that we objectively assess what the Mexican government has done over the past year , not put our hopes in what progress may come in the future . ''
Sandy Berger , the president 's national security adviser , defended Clinton 's decision .
`` The fundamental question we have to face is : ` Are we better off working with the Mexicans to deal with this mortal threat to them and us , or are we better off walking away and saying this is your problem , we 're not going to work with you ? ' ''
On Friday , seven Republican senators and one Democrat wrote Clinton recommending that in next year 's certification process , Mexico be judged more by results instead of efforts , The group , led by Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , said Mexico should be measured by its willingness to extradite drug bosses , its ability to arrest and prosecute money launderers and leaders of narcotics syndicates , and its record on drug eradication and seizures .
In a 733-page report issued in conjunction with the president 's certifications , the State Department emphasized positive aspects of Mexico 's efforts and said it was being judged by effort , not results .
The 11-page section on Mexico said the amount of heroin and marijuana seized by the government was little changed , but the amount of cocaine confiscated fell to 22.6 tons in 1998 , down from 34.9 tons the previous year .
U.S. analysts estimated that Mexican farmers grew about 37,500 acres of opium poppy in 1998 , up from 30,000 acres in 1997 .
Cannabis cultivation fell to 35,200 acres from 38,250 acres , according to the report .
`` The increase in poppy cultivation is particularly worrisome as it led to a net increase in heroin production despite a massive eradication effort , '' the administration reported .
`` In some quarters in the United States and Canada , heroin has gained an upscale image , the so-called ` heroin chic ' emaciated look of certain entertainment icons . ''
Federal law enforcement agencies estimate that about 65 percent of the cocaine entering the United States comes through Mexico and 29 percent of the heroin used here was smuggled in by Mexican cartels .
During the past two years , the State Department and Defense Department have funneled $ 92 million to the Mexican government for equipment and training to combat production and trafficking of drugs .
Like Mexico , Colombia was praised by the administration as much for the drug-war potential of its president , Andres Pastrana , as its actual progress in controlling narcotics .
`` We are impressed by the new government 's commitment to counternarcotics cooperation , '' the State Department said in its annual assessment , which is titled International Narcotics Control Strategy Report .
While Colombia remains the world 's leading producer and distributor of cocaine and a major source of heroin and marijuana , a combined U.S. - Colombian eradication program successfully sprayed more than 162,000 acres of coca , about 50 percent more than was eradicated a year earlier .
A year ago , Nigeria was decertified .
On Friday , the oil-rich nation , which has not changed its drug-fighting efforts , was given a national security waiver , thus ending U.S. sanctions .
Clinton and Berger acknowledged that the decision was aimed at helping Nigeria 's move toward democracy following the June 1998 death of authoritarian leader Sani Abacha .
Presidential elections are being held Saturday in Nigeria .
`` We are providing support for the transition , and if it succeeds we have to be prepared to do more , '' Clinton said .
`` Because we count on further progress , today we are also waiving the sanctions we imposed when its government did not cooperate in the fight against drugs . ''
The State Department report said Nigerian drug couriers are the leading smugglers of heroin into the United States .
`` Because of corruption at nearly all levels of government in Nigeria , combined with the country 's political turbulence , it is likely that Nigerian trafficking will remain strong for the political future , '' according to the report .
