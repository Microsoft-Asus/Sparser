 The three phyla of bryophytes are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts





Bryophytes are represented today by three separate phyla: phylum Hepatophyta, commonly called liverworts; phylum Anthocerophyta (hornworts); and phylum Bryophyta (mosses) (FIGURE 29.15). The suffix wort is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "herb," and liverworts and hornworts are indeed small herbaceous (nonwoody) plants named for their shapes. Mosses are the most familiar bryophytes. But some organisms commonly known as "mosses" are not really mosses or even bryophytes; these include Irish moss (a red seaweed), reindeer moss (a lichen), club mosses (pteridophytes), and Spanish moss (a flowering plant).

Note that the terms Bryophyta and bryophyte are not synonymous. Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for a certain phylum, the mosses. The term bryophyte refers informally to all the nonvascular plants--the phyla Hepatophyta, Anthocerophyta, and Bryophyta. These diverse bryophytes are not a monophyletic grouping. Gene sequence data, comparative cell structure, and other evidence indicate that liverworts, hornworts, and mosses diverged independently early in plant evolution, before the origin of vascular plants (see FIGURE 29.1). And as noted earlier, fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that bryophytes were the earliest plants. Though the identity of the modern bryophyte group most similar to the earliest plants is still uncertain, liverworts and hornworts may be the most reasonable models of what early plants were like. Most plant systematists now regard mosses as the bryophyte group most closely related to vascular plants (pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms).
