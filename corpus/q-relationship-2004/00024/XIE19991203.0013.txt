ATHENS , December 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A team of Greek and Turkish government officials began talks here Thursday on putting the final touches to a range of bilateral agreements arising from the recent dialogue between senior foreign ministry officials of the two neighboring countries .
The texts of the five bilateral agreements between Greece and Turkey refer to tourist cooperation , the environment , issues of security for citizens , economic cooperation and cooperation in the scientific and technological fields , the semi-official Athens News Agency -LRB- ANA -RRB- quoted diplomatic sources as saying .
The final touches to the agreements on the avoidance of double taxation , investment protection , shipping cooperation and cooperation in the energy sector are expected on Friday .
The sources said that a committee of senior foreign ministry officials from the two countries would convene before the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- summit in Helsinki next week and draft a report on the results of the talks .
For decades , Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their disputes in the territorial waters , air space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem .
Since the end of July , rounds of talks between senior foreign ministry officials of the two countries have taken place in Ankara and Athens respectively , with the aim of finding ways to improve their strained relations .
Analysts here believe that it is possible for the two long-time rivals to make progress in cooperation in the fields of tourism , the environment , culture , economy and science and technology , but it will be very difficult for them to reach consensus on the sensitive issues such as their disputes in the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem .
