Hormones convey information via the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body, while other types of chemical messengers reach their target in other ways. As you learned in Chapter 11, local regulators act between cells that are neighbors (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.3</span>). Once secreted by the cells that make them, these signal molecules are taken up by nearby target cells, broken down by enzymes in the vicinity, or fixed in place by extracellular matrix, all within seconds or even milliseconds. Consequently, local regulators can affect only local targets. Still other chemical signals, called pheromones, carry messages between different individuals of a species, as in mate attraction. You will learn more about pheromones in Chapter 46, which discusses animal reproduction. Before concentrating on hormones and their modes of action, let’s take a brief look at some local regulators and their effects on target cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
