 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals

Living in acid bogs and other habitats where soil conditions are poor (especially in nitrogen) are plants that fortify themselves by occasionally feeding on animals. These carnivorous plants make their own carbohydrates by photosynthesis, but they obtain some of their nitrogen and minerals by killing and digesting insects and other small animals. Various kinds of insect traps have evolved by the modification of leaves (FIGURE 37.16). The traps are usually equipped with glands that secrete digestive juices. Fortunately for the animal kingdom, this ironic turnabout is a relatively rare exception to the standard ecosystem dynamics of animals eating plants!

Fig 37-16. Carnivorous plants. (a) The Venus flytrap is a mod ified leaf with two lobes that close together rapidly enough to capture an insect. Prey that enters the trap touches sensory hairs, initiating an electrical impulse that triggers closure of the trap. Glands in the trap then secrete digestive enzymes, and nutrients are later absorbed by the modified leaf. In spite of its name, the flytrap catches more ants and grasshoppers than it does flies. (b) Pitcher plants use a pitfall to capture insects. Insects slip into a long water-filled funnel. After the insect drowns, it is digested by enzymes secreted into the water.
