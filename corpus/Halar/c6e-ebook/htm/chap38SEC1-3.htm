In the general sense, it refers to innovations in the use of plants, or of substances obtained from plants, to make products of use to humans--an endeavor that began in prehistory. Used in a more specific sense, biotechnology refers to the use of genetically modified (GM) organisms in agriculture and industry. Indeed, in the last two decades, genetic engineering has become such a powerful--some would say too powerful--force in biotechnology that the terms <span class="Emphasis1">genetic engineering</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">biotechnology</span> have become synonymous in the media. In this last section, we examine the question of how humans have altered plants to suit their purposes from the birth of agriculture to the present.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
