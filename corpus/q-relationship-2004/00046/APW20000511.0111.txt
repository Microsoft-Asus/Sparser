GALASHKI , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Rebel gunmen burst out of a wooded ditch Thursday and ambushed a Russian troop convoy in a region west of Chechnya , killing 18 soldiers in the first major attack outside the breakaway republic in months , the military said .
Federal officials warned that the raid signaled the Chechens ' intention to expand their fight to other Russian territories and urged strengthened police control over regions bordering Chechnya .
Meanwhile , Russia succeeded Thursday in avoiding punitive action from the Council of Europe , long critical of Russia 's treatment of civilians in Chechnya .
Russia promised to investigate human rights violations and allow international organizations in Chechnya .
In Thursday 's attack , the convoy was passing along a wooded , upward-sloping section of road in the Russian republic of Ingushetia when gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and grenade launchers , Russian military investigators on the scene told The Associated Press .
They spoke on condition of anonymity .
The convoy 's captain Sergei Maziyev , the only one of the 22 servicemen to escape unharmed , told reporters that the attack near the village of Galashki happened too quickly for the soldiers to put up serious resistance .
Sixteen were killed immediately , two died of wounds on the way to hospital , and three were wounded .
The unit had finished its tour and the men were heading home when they were attacked , the military said .
It was unclear whether any of the attackers was harmed .
Russian special forces were searching the surrounding hills and woods for the gunmen , and sappers could be seen searching for mines believed to have been left by the attackers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Ingushetia , which borders Chechnya , has been the site of occasional crossover attacks by Chechen rebels , and Russia has a heavy military presence there .
The border has been a key crossing for some 200,000 refugees fleeing the fighting in Chechnya</ENAMEX> .
Chechen rebels have been stepping up ambushes on Russian convoys in the last two months , killing at least 100 soldiers inside Chechnya .
Russian officials were convinced the gunmen in Thursday 's attack were Chechen rebels .
`` This is alarming because it shows that the rebels are aiming to spread the conflict , expand the war zone to neighboring territories , '' said the Kremlin 's spokesman on Chechnya , Sergei Yastrzhembsky .
Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev , commander of Russian troops in the region , urged police in neighboring Russian republics to step up controls of everyone leaving Chechnya , even refugees .
Russian troops entered Chechnya after Chechnya -based militants seized villages in Dagestan in August .
Moscow says the offensive is aimed at quashing terrorists and the violence that had plagued the region since a 1994-6 Chechnya war .
Russia has come under intense international criticism over the war , and the Strasbourg -based Council of Europe , the continent 's top human rights body , has denied Russia its voting rights in the council 's parliamentary assembly to protest Russia 's treatment of civilians in Chechnya .
But on Thursday , Council of Europe nations chose a more conciliatory stance and decided to take no immediate action against Russia over its handling of the Chechen war .
It welcomed statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin that human rights abuses will be punished .
Following threats that Europe 's main human rights watchdog would suspend Russia over allegations of abuses , Russia pledged to cooperate with international institutions that want to investigate the allegations .
Not including Thursday 's attack , 2,233 Russian servicemen have been killed since August , the military said Thursday .
That did not include unconfirmed rebel attacks , such as one Wednesday in which rebels claimed to have killed 30 soldiers .
Both the Russian military and the rebels exaggerate the other side 's losses while playing down their own .
Inside Chechnya , the military said federal jets flew 12 sorties to bomb suspected rebel positions in southern Chechnya over the past 24 hours .
Combat helicopters also flew 30 flights .
