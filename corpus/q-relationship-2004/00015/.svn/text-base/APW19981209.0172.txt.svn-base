TEHRAN , Iran
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
U.S. President Bill Clinton 's decision to remove Iran from its list of drug-problem countries was long overdue , Iran 's foreign minister said in remarks published Wednesday .
`` The recognition by the U.S. is late .
Iran has been considered a champion in drug fighting for many years and the U.S. has accepted this fact now , '' Kamal Kharrazi told the Tehran Times .
Iran spends dlrs 400 million a year in its fight against drugs and has played a crucial role in preventing narcotics from reaching other countries , including places in Europe , Kharrazi said .
Iranian television reported Kharrazi as saying 2,350 Iranians had died in the fight against drugs .
The minister was apparently referring to anti-narcotics agents killed in clashes with smuggler , but he did not give a time frame for the figure .
Kharrazi 's comments were the first by an Iranian official since President Bill Clinton announced Monday that he was removing Iran from the list of countries the United States considers to be lax on drugs .
In a letter to Congress , Clinton said that Iran is no longer a significant producer of opium poppy , the raw material for heroin , and that it has ceased to be a major transit point for U.S. -bound illicit drugs .
Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988 .
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity of narcotics .
Large drug hauls are common in Iran , which lies on a route used by smugglers to carry drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe and the oil-rich Gulf .
Tehran has also mounted a vigorous campaign to rid the country of opium poppies .
