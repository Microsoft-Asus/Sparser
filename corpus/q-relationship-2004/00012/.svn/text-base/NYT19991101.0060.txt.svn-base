WASHINGTON --
The Federal Aviation Administration warned air security personnel in September of a bomb threat against an unspecified plane leaving from the same US cities as EgyptAir Flight 990 , but government officials said Sunday the threat had ultimately proved `` not credible . ''
The FAA issued the alert to airlines and airports Sept. 24 after someone told several US government agencies that a bomb would `` soon be used '' on a flight departing from Los Angeles Airport or New York 's Kennedy Airport , the Associated Press reported .
But an aviation official and other government sources said Sunday that the FAA quickly learned that the individual responsible for the tip was in jail on a murder charge and had a history of making wild assertions .
EgyptAir Flight 990 originated in Los Angeles and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after departing from Kennedy International Airport for Cairo early Sunday .
The alert expired Saturday .
`` The FAA issued the alert , but they investigated it and found there were no grounds for it , '' said a State Department official .
`` In any case , they 're dismissing any connection '' between the threat and Flight 990 , he said .
The State Department official said there had been no air sabotage threats arising from President Clinton 's trip to Norway , which began Sunday .
Clinton is in Oslo to discuss the Middle East peace process with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Norway is also having ceremonies to mark the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .
At the Egyptian Embassy in Washington , spokesman Abdel Aleem El Abyad said no terrorist group had claimed responsibility for downing Flight 990 .
`` Nobody has called us .
Nobody has called the Americans to claim anything , '' he said Sunday night .
El Abyad also said that Egypt 's minister of transportation had already issued a statement saying no foul play was involved , though he added that it was too early to draw that conclusion .
US officials also said there was no evidence that the plane was sabotaged , though intelligence officers at several federal agencies began studying the possibility .
The National Transportation Safety Board , the lead investigative agency , appeared to be taking steps to downplay speculation that terrorism caused the disaster .
After the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 , the NTSB held a series of joint press conferences with the FBI , which heightened the perception that a criminal act had caused that crash .
Sunday , NTSB officials took the podium alone at a press conference , even though the FBI is also investigating .
`` This is a different kind of investigation , '' said Jamie Finch , an NTSB spokesman .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` With TWA , the question at the very beginning was whether terrorism was involved , '' and the NTSB shared that suspicion , he said .</ENAMEX>
Security experts said that airlines and law enforcement agencies receive hundreds of threats to air safety each year , but that most of them are investigated and dismissed as not credible .
Relatively few threats prompt alerts such as the one the FAA issued Sept. 24 .
`` Two hundred of those -LRB- threats -RRB- come every day from people in prison , nuts on the street , crank calls to local police agencies , '' said Vince Cannistraro , the CIA 's former counterterrorism chief , who led the agency 's probe of the 1988 crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland .
He said that only a `` limited number '' of the calls turn into FAA alerts after investigation by the FBI , the CIA or other law enforcement agencies .
Another air security specialist , who works for a Maryland security firm , said that many threats are so inspecific , mentioning no airline or time frame , that it is difficult to issue a useful alert .
The security specialist , who asked that his name not be printed , speculated that the few facts known so far about the disaster suggest that a bomb was not involved .
A timer seemed unlikely to this person because Flight 990 was delayed at the New York airport for nearly three hours after its scheduled departure of 10 : 30 p.m. Saturday , EDT .
The fact that the plane was at cruising altitude for some time suggested to this person that a detonator keyed to barometric pressure also seemed unlikely .
Intelligence officials working on the Flight 990 crash would likely study a set of Egyptian terrorist groups that oppose secular rule in Egypt and the regime of President Hosni Mubarak , even though none of the groups has been implicated in the crash in any way .
The groups include the Eqyptian Muslim Brotherhood ; al- Gamaa al- Islamiya , which is accused of killing foreign tourists in Egypt ; and Islamic Jihad , which is allied with Osama bin Laden , the fugitive Saudi millionaire who allegedly backed the 1998 attack on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
Cannistraro noted that these groups had not issued a threat against the airliner and have no background in airline terrorism .
`` There is nothing in the threat environment that indicates that this was the result of a terrorist incident , '' Cannistraro said of the Flight 990 crash .
