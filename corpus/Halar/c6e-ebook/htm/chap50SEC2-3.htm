Ecology can be divided into four increasingly comprehensive levels of study, from the ecology of individual organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 50.2</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig50-2','../fig/big/fig50-2.jpg','fig50-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig50-2.jpg" alt="fig50-2" name="myfig50-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 50-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Sample questions at different levels of ecology. (a) Organismal ecology.</span> How do diving whales select their feeding areas? <span class="Emphasis2">(b) Population ecology.</span> What factors limit the number of striped mice that can inhabit a particular area? <span class="Emphasis2">(c) Community ecology.</span> What factors influence the diversity of tree species that make up a particular forest? <span class="Emphasis2">(d) Ecosystem ecology.</span> What processes recycle vital chemical elements, such as nitrogen, within a savanna ecosystem?</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Organismal ecology</span> is concerned with the morphological, physiological, and behavioral ways in which individual organisms meet the challenges posed by their biotic and abiotic environments. The geographic distribution of organisms is often limited by the abiotic conditions they can tolerate.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">A <span class="Emphasis2">population</span> is a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular geographic area. <span class="Emphasis2">Population ecology</span> concentrates mainly on factors that affect how many individuals of a particular species live in an area.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">A <span class="Emphasis2">community</span> consists of all the organisms of all the species that inhabit a particular area; it is an assemblage of populations of many different species. Thus, <span class="Emphasis2">community ecology</span> deals with the whole array of interacting species in a community. This level of research focuses on the ways in which interactions such as predation, competition, and disease affect community structure and organization.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">An <span class="Emphasis2">ecosystem</span> consists of all the abiotic factors in addition to the entire community of species that exist in a certain area. An ecosystem--a lake, for example--may contain many different communities. In <span class="Emphasis2">ecosystem ecology,</span> the emphasis is on energy flow and the cycling of chemicals among the various biotic and abiotic components.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Looking beyond the four basic levels of ecology, we come to <span class="Emphasis2">landscape ecology,</span> which deals with arrays of ecosystems and how they are arranged in a geographic region. A <span class="Emphasis2">landscape</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">seascape</span> consists of several different ecosystems linked by exchanges of energy, materials, and organisms. The landscape level of research focuses on the ways in which interactions among populations, communities, and ecosystems are affected by the juxtaposition of different ecosystems, such as streams, lakes, old-growth forests, and forest patches that have had their trees removed by clear-cut logging.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">biosphere</span> is the global ecosystem--the sum of all the planet’s ecosystems. The most extensive level in ecology, the biosphere includes the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers, the land down to and including water-bearing rocks at least 3,000 m belowground, lakes and streams, caves, and the oceans to a depth of several kilometers. An example of research at the biosphere level is the analysis of how changes in atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration affect global climate.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
