There’s a car coming!</span>&nbsp;<span class="Emphasis1">We don’t really need such a warning to remind us of the importance of communication in our lives. Perhaps less obvious is the critical role of communication in life at the cellular level. Cell-to-cell communication is absolutely essential for multicellular organisms. The billions of cells in a human or an oak tree must communicate in order to coordinate their activities in a way that enables the organism to develop from a fertilized egg and then survive and reproduce in turn. Communication between cells is also important for many unicellular organisms, such as the yeast pictured in the micrograph on this page.</span></p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In studying how cells signal to each other and how they interpret the signals they receive, biologists have discovered some universal mechanisms of cellular regulation, additional evidence for the evolutionary relatedness of all life. The same small set of cell-signaling mechanisms are showing up again and again in many lines of biological research. And to the delight of scientists, studies of cell signaling are helping to answer some of the most important questions in biology and medicine</span>--<span class="Emphasis1">in areas ranging from embryological development to hormone action to cancer and other kinds of disease.</span></p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The signals received by cells, whether originating from other cells or from changes in the physical environment, take various forms. For instance, cells can sense and respond to electromagnetic signals, such as light, and to mechanical signals, such as touch. (In later units of this text, we discuss cellular detection of these and other kinds of physical signals.) However, cells most often communicate with each other by chemical signals. In this chapter, we focus on the main mechanisms by which cells detect, process, and respond to chemical signals sent from other cells.</span></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
