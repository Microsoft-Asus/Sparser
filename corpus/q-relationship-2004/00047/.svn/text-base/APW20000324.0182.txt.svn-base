LONDON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- OPEC members are likely to agree to raise crude oil production at next week 's meeting , U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Friday .
`` It 's essential at the meeting they take action to correct the instability of oil prices , '' he told a news conference in London .
Richardson 's comments followed a round of talks with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , including Algeria , Nigeria , Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates .
OPEC members meet Monday at Vienna , Austria .
`` It appears OPEC has agreed to increase production , '' he said .
Richardson said that seven of the 11 members of the cartel recognize a need for an oil increase .
He did not name the holdouts , but Libya , Iran and Algeria have expressed opposition to increasing oil output .
Iraq , too , has objected to Western demands for production rises .
Richardson said he believes a `` sizable '' increase is needed , but would n't elaborate .
`` The market should dictate numbers , '' he said .
OPEC oil ministers are widely expected to reach an agreement at their meeting to boost world petroleum supplies .
But it remains unclear if the increase will be sufficient to quickly reduce oil prices from the highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf War .
Cutbacks by oil producers in 1998 and 1999 to try to bolster prices that had fallen to 12-year lows have sent crude prices soaring .
They hit a nine-year high of $ 34.37 a barrel on March 8 in intraday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have eased in recent days in anticipation of an OPEC agreement to increase output .
But oil rose Friday amid questions on how far OPEC would go .
The main blend of U.S. crude rose 71 cents Friday to $ 28.02 a barrel in contracts for May delivery on Nymex .
Analysts expect OPEC to raise output by a million barrels a day or more .
But experts say that at least 2 million barrels to 2.5 million barrels daily are needed to replenish depleted inventories and satisfy growing demand .
It may be in OPEC 's interest to help provide some price relief .
If high oil prices start damaging the economies of importing countries , demand for oil will plunge and OPEC revenue could decline .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Also , non- OPEC producers that have cut production in tandem with the cartel , including Mexico and Norway , have said they will review their policies after OPEC ministers act</ENAMEX> .
Richardson spoke here after meeting with the United Arab Emirates ' oil minister , Obaid bin Saif Al - Nasseri .
He described the session as `` very productive . ''
Richardson said that while many OPEC officials 40 days ago were talking about continuing production cuts , `` today , the consensus seems to be for a production increase . ''
He added : `` Our diplomatic efforts have made a difference . ''
He said the United States would like to see OPEC increase production to close the gap between world demand for crude of 75 million barrels and the current supply of about 73 million barrels .
OPEC countries produce about 35 percent of the world 's crude .
