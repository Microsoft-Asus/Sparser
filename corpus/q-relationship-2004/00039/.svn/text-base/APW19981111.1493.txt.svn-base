-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The fate of the disputed Kuril Islands was in the balance Thursday as President Boris Yeltsin prepared to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and reportedly deliver his long-awaited response to Japan 's proposals to resolve the conflict .
The four islands north of Japan and known in that country as the Northern Territories were once held by Tokyo but have been controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II .
Both nations claimed ownership , and the dispute is the main reason the two have n't signed a formal peace treaty for the war .
Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan in April .
The proposals have not been made public .
Media reports have said Tokyo suggests taking over the islands legally but allowing Russia to retain control for some time .
Yeltsin has long stalled , but is expected to finally give an answer when he meets with Obuchi behind closed doors on Thursday , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
The Kremlin does not intend to disclose the proposal or Yeltsin 's response , ITAR - Tass said .
During their summit in Krasnoyarsk in November 1997 , Yeltsin and Hashimoto pledged to make the utmost effort to sign a peace treaty by 2000 .
But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the Kurils .
`` I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of our children and grandchildren , '' Obuchi told the Russian daily newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday .
Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention_ Etorofu , Kunashiri , Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- in a treaty with Russia in 1875 .
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War II , a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal .
The islands total only about 4,000 square miles -LRB- 10,350 square kilometers -RRB- , slightly larger than the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico .
The waters around them , however , are rich fishing grounds .
The summit was to be Yeltin 's first high-level meeting since his latest illness sidelined him a month ago .
And the president 's office said Wednesday that the 67-year -old leader planned to visit Japan next spring or summer .
Russia 's ambassador to Japan , Alexander Panov , said recently that Japan needs to improve its relations with Russia before any tough decision can be made on the Kurils dispute .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">About a week before the summit , Japan announced plans to give an dlrs 800 million loan to Russia .</ENAMEX>
The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund but put on hold after Russia succumbed to economic crisis in August , devaluing the ruble and defaulting on domestic treasury debts .
No timetable has been set for the release of the loan , but Obuchi 's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it `` would not be a months-long wait , '' the Interfax news agency reported .
