 "Evo-devo": Genes that control development play a major role in evolution

The interface between evolutionary biology and the study of how organisms develop is called "evo-devo." This interdisciplinary research is beginning to illuminate how slight genetic divergences can become magnified into major morphological differences between species. Genes that program development control the rate, timing, and spatial pattern of changes in an organism's form as it is transfigured from a zygote into an adult.

The shape of an organism depends in part on the relative growth rates of its different parts during development. This proportioning that helps give a body its specific form is called allometric growth (from the Greek allos, other, and metron, measure). FIGURE 24.19a tracks how allometric growth alters human body proportions during development. Change these relative rates of growth even slightly, and you change the adult form substantially. For example, different allometric patterns contribute to the contrasting shapes of human and chimpanzee skulls (FIGURE 24.19b).

Evolution of morphology that arises by a modification in allometric growth is an example of heterochrony, which is evolutionary change in the rate or timing of developmental events. We can see another example of heterochrony in the evolution of salamander feet. Most salamanders are ground-dwelling, but some species live in trees. The feet of these tree-dwelling salamanders are adapted for climbing vertically rather than walking horizontally on the ground, with shorter digits and more webbing than the feet of ground-dwelling salamanders (FIGURE 24.20). The basis for this adaptation was probably selection for mutant alleles of genes controlling the timing of foot development. According to this hypothesis, the foot of the ancestral salamander grew until the products of certain regulatory genes switched off growth, resulting in a foot of a certain size. A mutation in one or more of these regulatory genes could have switched off foot growth sooner, resulting in the stunted feet of tree-dwelling salamanders. In this way, a relatively small amount of genetic change can be amplified into the substantial morphological change that marks macroevolution.

Heterochrony can also change the timing of reproductive development relative to development of somatic (nonreproductive) organs. If the rate of reproductive development accelerates compared to somatic development, the sexually mature stage of a species may retain body features that were juvenile structures in an ancestral species. This is called paedomorphosis (from the Greek paedos, child, and morphosis, formation). For example, most salamander species have a larval stage that undergoes metamorphosis to become an adult. But some species grow to adult size and become sexually mature while retaining gills and certain other larval features (FIGURE 24.21). Such an evolutionary alteration of developmental timing can produce animals that appear very different from their ancestors, even though the overall genetic change may be small.

In short, heterochrony affects the evolution of morphology by altering the rates of development of various body parts or by changing the timing of onset or completion of a particular part's development.

Macroevolution can also result from changes in genes that control the placement and spatial organization of body parts. For example, genes called homeotic genes determine such basic features as where a pair of wings and a pair of legs will develop on a bird or how a plant's flower parts are arranged (see Chapter 21).

The products of one class of homeotic genes called Hox genes provide positional information in an animal embryo. This information about position prompts cells to develop into structures appropriate for a particular location. Changes in Hox genes can have a profound impact on morphology. Consider, for example, the evolution of tetrapods (the terrestrial vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) from fishes, which are aquatic vertebrates. One of the major transitions in this vertebrate history was the evolution of the walking legs of tetrapods from the fins of fishes. Unlike the fish fin, the tetrapod limb has digits (fingers and toes in humans) that extend skeletal support to the tip of the limb. During the development of a tetrapod, a Hox gene is expressed at the outer edge of the limb bud, the embryonic structure that develops into a leg. The product of this Hox gene apparently provides positional information about how far outward bones should grow in the limb (FIGURE 24.22). A related Hox gene is expressed during the development of a fish fin, but in a smaller region back from the tip of the fin bud. A mutation in this Hox gene that expanded its region of expression to the tip of the bud probably contributed to the evolution of skeletal extensions that made it possible for limbs to support vertebrates on land. The evolution of vertebrates from invertebrate animals was an even bigger episode in macroevolution, and it, too, was probably associated with changes in Hox genes (see FIGURE 24.23, p. 480).

In producing evolutionary novelties, changes in developmental dynamics, both temporal (heterochrony) and spatial, have undoubtedly played important roles in macroevolution.
