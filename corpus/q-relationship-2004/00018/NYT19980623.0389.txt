TOKYO --
South Korea protested on Tuesday the incursion of a North Korean sub into its waters but lost control of the vessel when a towing cable broke and it sank to the sea bottom .
South Korean naval forces were towing the 60-foot submarine under intensive security Tuesday morning when the cable broke .
The sub was then within a mile of the shore , and South Korean officials said that the boat was only about 100 feet down and that they would try to raise her as soon as possible .
Several North Korean crew members had been believed aboard , but there has been speculation that they may have committed suicide to avoid capture .
If they are alive and on board , South Korean officials said , they could still be rescued .
The incident , the latest bizarre episode in the odyssey of inter- Korean relations , began on Monday afternoon when a South Korean fishing boat spotted a dark green sub with the periscope entangled in drift nets 11 miles off the South Korean coast .
The fishermen saw officers from the submarine as they frantically tried to cut the nets and radioed the authorities .
The South Korean navy arrived in a rush to seize the sub .
South Korea towed the sub in an intensive military operation to make sure that there was no North Korean rescue attempt .
But the South Korean navy had apparently overlooked the need for a strong enough cable to tow the 70-ton sub .
By some accounts , there was a loud noise heard at one point from inside the sub , possibly an attempt by the crew to kill themselves or to destroy the interior before South Korean and American intelligence analysts could examine it .
South Korea accused the North of a provocation that violated the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War .
But tensions seemed to ease a bit Tuesday .
There is no evidence that the sub had dropped off infiltrators or was planning to , and it was well offshore and not far south of the line that divides North and South Korean waters .
North Korea has not directly commented on the seizure .
But it issued an unusual statement Tuesday asserting that it had lost a submarine and was wondering where it might be .
The statement added that North Korea was `` now searching for the submarine and its crew . ''
North Korea did not need to search very hard .
Generals from the United States and other countries on the U.N. side of the Korean War raised the intrusion in discussions Tuesday with North Korean counterparts in the border town of Panmunjon , along the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas .
The effects of the intrusion on North - South relations are unclear .
While it will add to suspicions in the South about North Korea 's intentions and , perhaps , make conciliatory efforts by President Kim Dae -jung of South Korea more difficult , the tone of the latest South Korean news reports and official comments has not been particularly hostile .
In contrast , the reaction to a submarine incursion in 1996 was furious .
But in that case the North Korean sub ran aground , and heavily armed commandos slipped ashore .
After a series of firefights , all but one commando were killed or captured .
