<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Settling the question of who controls Gibraltar -- a territorial dispute with Britain that has raged for more than two centuries -- is high on Spain 's agenda , the foreign minister told the U.N. General Assembly .</ENAMEX>
`` During the 1997 round of negotitaions , I submitted a proposal which would allow Spain to regain soveriegnty over Gibraltar , at the same time maintaining all the current advantages of the inhabitants of this territory , '' Abel Matutes said Wednesday .
The United Nations has played a role in many of the regional conflicts that have erupted in the aftermath of decolonization .
`` With the decade for decolonization about to end , I believe it is important to recall that the historic work performed by the -LRB- United Nations -RRB- in this field cannot be considered complete as long as colonial situations remain , '' Matutes said .
`` Every year , the General Assmebly renews its appeals to Spain and the United Kingdom to continue their negotiations with a view to putting an end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Gibraltar , an island at the entrance to the Mediterranean , has bedeviled relations between Spain and Britain since the land was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 .</ENAMEX>
The conservative government of Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid has been vigorously pressing Spain 's claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">However , the 55,000 Gibraltarians overwhelmingly oppose becoming a part of Spain , and Britain argues that it cannot hand over sovereignty without the consent of the colony 's residents </ENAMEX>.
In response , a British deputy representative later said his government will not allow Gibraltar 's `` sovereignty to pass to another against the freely expressed wishes '' of its citizens .
Only continuing direct talks with Spain is the `` means to overcoming our differences , '' he said .
