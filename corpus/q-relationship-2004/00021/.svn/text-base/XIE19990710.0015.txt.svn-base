ALGIERS , July 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Said Essaihaf Friday complained about the sanctions against it and urged Arab countries to unite and help Bagdad get rid of the embargo .
As a special guest invited for the 35th Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- scheduled for July 12-14 here , Essaihaf said that his government is expecting moral support in favor of Iraq 's `` just claim to lift the embargo imposed on us for some nine years now . ''
The United Nations imposed the sanctions against Bagdad after Iraq invaded Kuwait during the gulf war nine years ago .
As for the new Iraqi initiative to get out of the crisis , Essaihaf said that it consists of an opposition to the position of the United States `` whose sole objective is to impose its hegemony on Iraq . ''
The Iraqi minister said that his government is asking all Arab states to be interdependent with Iraq and to call for the lifting of the embargo which is a `` fair claim '' .
He said , `` we owe our participation to this summit to Algeria and we will attempt to prepare all forthcoming OAU meetings '' so as to explain to our African friends the relation between Iraq and the U.N. Security Council and the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq .
