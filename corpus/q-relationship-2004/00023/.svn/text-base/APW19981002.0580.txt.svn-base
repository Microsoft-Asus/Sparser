FREETOWN , Sierra Leone
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The United Nations Children 's Fund urged Sierra Leone 's government Friday to disarm the country 's legion of child warriors and give amnesty to rebel youngsters captured in battle .
Speaking to journalists during a two-day visit , UNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy said she was `` troubled '' after meeting a contingent of child Kamajor , or Civil Defense Force , soldiers a day earlier during a whistle-stop tour in the country 's interior .
`` UNICEF is very clear that children should not be put into combat positions , or be made messengers or be sexually abused in fighting forces , '' Bellamy said after meetings with the president and other government ministers .
Sierra Leone has more than 4,000 child soldiers by U.N. estimates , and many observers believe the real figure is much higher .
During her visit , Bellamy attended a mock demobilization ceremony of child soldiers in the town of Bo north about 350 kilometers -LRB- 220 miles -RRB- northwest of the capital , Freetown .
There , children danced and sang for Bellamy and other UNICEF and government officials .
Many of the children -- who wore elaborate traditional dresses and headgear carried guns and ranged in age from 7 to 17 -- told journalists they wished to go to school but also enjoyed killing `` the wicked enemy , '' a reference to members of the rebel Revolutionary United Front .
Some of the children had up to two years of battle experience .
Kamajor leaders said that they were waiting for funding from the government and United Nations before the children would come home from the bush and take up civilian life .
`` We need money for the demobilization .
The children have nothing to go back to and need support for technical schooling and re-integration into their communities , '' said John Lawundeh , the Kamajor commander of the Komboya district surrounding Bo. The Kamajors , traditional fighters who believe they are protected from harm by their spiritual beliefs , are allied with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah 's government and Nigerian -led West African intervention troops who restored Kabbah to power in March .
Kabbah was deposed in a bloody armed coup in May last year by military troops allied to the rebels and led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma , who has since gone into hiding .
Bellamy said both sides in the continuing conflict in the interior `` bear responsibility '' to demobilize child soldiers and end the recruitment children to their ranks .
The RUF have been accused of kidnapping children to join their cause while several Kamajor children told journalists they were prompted to fight after members of their families were killed , maimed and raped by rebels .
Although figures are not available , aid workers believe several thousand of people have injured or killed in fighting since March .
