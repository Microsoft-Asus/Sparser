MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russia 's space agency said Friday that the International Space Station remains its main priority even though it may struggle to replace rockets that will now be used to extend the lifetime of the Mir station .
`` There is no alternative to the ISS for Russia , '' said agency head Yuri Koptev .
`` I would like once again to confirm Russia 's adherence to this project . ''
On Thursday , Russia decided to keep the troubled Mir in orbit at least through August by using booster rockets and spaceships that had been intended for the 16-nation ISS .
The government will now have to pay for construction of new ships and rockets for the international station .
The United States has long urged Russia to abandon the 14-year -old Mir and commit its resources to the ISS , which is far behind schedule due to Russian failure to finance construction of some elements .
Koptev said Russia would launch the long-delayed crew module to the ISS from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan in late July , to be followed by a piloted spaceship and two cargo ships .
The latest delay in the module 's launch has been caused by two crashes of Proton booster rockets -- the same type that would be used for the module .
Investigation has revealed that the crashes last year resulted from a manufacturing flaw in one specific series of rocket engines .
Koptev insisted that all necessary steps have been taken to avoid any malfunctions in the future .
Koptev admitted that building three more ships for the ISS to fill the gap caused by allocating hardware to the Mir would be difficult for the cash-strapped government .
`` There is no problem whatsoever to manufacture these rockets , the essential thing is financial resources , '' Koptev said .
Mir has been flying without a crew since August , and <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">heavily indebted Russia has been looking for funding from private investors to keep it operating rather than abandoning it .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The state-controlled RKK Energia company , which owns Mir , said this month that it had found a foreign investor who has already transferred $ 7 million of a promised initial investment of $ 20 million .</ENAMEX>
