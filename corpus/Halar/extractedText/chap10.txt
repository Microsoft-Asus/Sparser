Chapter 10: PHOTOSYNTHESIS

PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN NATURE

   Plants and other autotrophs are the producers of the biosphere

   Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants



THE PATHWAYS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS

   Evidence that chloroplasts split water molecules enabled researchers to track atoms through photosynthesis

   The light reactions and the Calvin cycle cooperate in converting light energy to the chemical energy of food: an overview

   The light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH: a closer look

   The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 to sugar: a closer look

   Alternative mechanisms of carbon fixation have evolved in hot, arid climates

   Photosynthesis is the biosphere's metabolic foundation: a review

Life on Earth is solar powered. The chloroplasts of plants capture light energy that has traveled 160 million kilometers from the sun and convert it to chemical energy stored in sugar and other organic molecules. The conversion process is called photosynthesis. In this chapter, you will learn how photosynthesis works. We begin by placing photosynthesis in its ecological context.
