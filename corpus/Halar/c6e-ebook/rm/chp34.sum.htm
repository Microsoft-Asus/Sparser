The three main features of human anatomical evolution are bipedal locomotion, reduction of the jaw, and expansion of the brain. Bipedal locomotion evolved before changes in the jaw and brain, as evident in fossils of <span class="Emphasis1">Australopithecus afarensis</span>. Around 2 to 2.5 million years ago, the genus <span class="Emphasis1">Homo</span> originated as a hominid lineage with larger brains and smaller jaws. Stone tools were associated with fossils of the earliest <span class="Emphasis1">Homo</span> species, <span class="Emphasis1">H. habilis</span>.

There are two hypotheses for the evolution and geographic spread of anatomically modern humans: the "multiregional" and "Out of Africa" (replacement) hypotheses. Genetic evidence, including DNA sequences from Neanderthal fossils and analysis of Y chromosomes, supports the replacement hypothesis, but the multiregional hypothesis has some supporters, who mainly cite fossil evidence.</p><a name="para59"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity34C:<span class="Emphasis1">
