BEIJING , March 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- China 's development program for the next 15 years heralds a bright future for national revitalization , and gives broad vistas for the growth of economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Straits .
This is the view shared by Taiwan deputies to the National People 's Congress -LRB- NPC -RRB- and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference -LRB- CPPCC -RRB- , both bodies are currently in session in Beijing .
With China 's on-going reform and opening-up drive exerting influences on world economy , Taiwan is not exempted from the impact as part of world economy , said Cai Zimin , an NPC deputy and chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self - Government League .
`` With Taiwan 's small market within the island and scarce natural resources , '' Cai explained , `` its economic development must be geared to the international market . ''
Since late 1980s , Taiwan 's main export and import markets shifted from the Unite States and Japan to southeast Asia and the Chinese mainland , `` which was both the need for Taiwan 's economic development and the factor behind the expansion of cross-straits economic and trade ties over the past decade . ''
The two sides of the straits complement each other in development levels , industrial structure , and capitals , said Cai. The Chinese mainland can help Taiwan with a relatively well-developed industrial structure and advanced technologies in space , aviation , machinery and electronics , and metallurgical industries , said Cai , while the development of the mainland needs Taiwan 's funds , management experience , and marketing networks .
Commenting on the Taiwan authorities ' mainland policies in recent years , CPPCC member Zheng Lizhi said , fighting against the attempt for Taiwan 's independence is essential for the promotion of cross-trade economic and trade ties .
President Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Chinese government adheres to principle of `` one China '' and is against `` two Chinas '' or `` one China , one Taiwan '' ; meanwhile , the government insists that political differences should not affect economic cooperation across the straits , which represents the policy of the Chinese government on cross-straits trade and economic cooperation , Zheng said .
