TEHRAN , November 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iran said Sunday it is ready to buy Caspian oil and gas in an effort to convince the Caspian Sea littoral states to export their oil and gas through Iranian territory .
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi voiced the readiness in a message to the second international seminar on Caspian oil and gas , which opened here Saturday , the official news agency IRNA reported .
Kharrazi said that Iran is ready to buy 1.5 million barrels of oil and 200 million cubic meters of gas each day for its domestic consumption .
`` We believe we are the best trading partner in any venture for exploration of Caspian resources , '' he said .
Besides , transferring oil to Europe by pipeline through Iran and via Iranian ports is the most logical route that can be used by Caspian littoral countries thanks to its extensive network of ports , railways , roads and oil pipelines , Kharrazi said .
The five Caspian littoral countries are Iran , Russia , Turkmenistan , Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan .
Iran believes cooperation in exploitation and transport of resources can pave the way for forging stronger regional cooperative links and serve as a vehicle for peace , security and sustainable economic development , he said .
In an effort to have a share in the transfer of Caspian oil , Iran earlier announced a barter plan to receive the Caspian oil in the north while delivering equivalent amount of Iranian oil in the Gulf to the consumers of the Caspian states .
However , the U.S. , which prefers to see the oil from the Caspian passing through an allied country like Turkey , rather than hostile Iran , has firmly opposed the plan .
It has threatened to impose an embargo on foreign companies which invested in Iran 's energy sector .
Russia , Turkey and Iran all vie for pipelines that transfer Caspian oil and gas to the West to traverse their territories .
Oil from Azerbaijan started flowing through a preliminary Russian pipeline last fall to Russia 's Black Sea port of Novorossisk , from where the oil will be transported to Europe in tankers through the Bosporus Strait .
But Turkey and the U.S. are opposed to the Russian route , arguing that the heavy oil tanker traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait has led to hundreds of accidents .
Meanwhile , Turkey has received strong support from the U.S. to build a pipeline from the Azeri capital of Baku to its mediterranean port of Ceyhan .
The post-cold war era unilateralism , pursued by the U.S. , is doomed to fail , Kharrazi said , `` this policy has to be stopped , if we want economic prosperity for our region that will undoubtedly have positive impact on the world economy as well . ''
