The forum dealt with `` market access : developments since the Uruguay Round , implications , opportunities and challenges , in particular for the developing countries , the least developed among them , in the context of globalization and liberalization '' .
The council stressed the importance of effective application by all members of the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- of the provisions of the Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations , by taking into account the specific interests of developing countries .
The Generalized System of preferences -LRB- GSP -RRB- remains a major instrument for further improving market access of developing countries and there is scope and need for further improvement of the GSP , the communique said .
