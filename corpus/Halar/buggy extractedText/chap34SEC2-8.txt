 Vertebrate jaws evolved from skeletal supports of the pharyngeal slits

Vertebrate jaws evolved by modification of the skeletal rods that had previously supported the anterior pharyngeal (gill) slits (FIGURE 34.10). The remaining gill slits, no longer required for suspension feeding, remained as the major sites of respiratory gas exchange with the external environment. The origin of vertebrate jaws from these skeletal parts illustrates a general feature of evolutionary change: New adaptations usually evolve by the modification of existing structures. As a mechanism of adaptation, evolution is limited by the raw material with which it must work. Evolution is generally more of a remodeling process than a creative one.

Fig 34-10. Hypothesis for the evolution of vertebrate jaws. The skeleton of the jaws and their supports evolved from two pairs of skeletal rods located between gill slits that were near the mouth. Pairs of rods anterior to those that formed the jaws were either lost or incorporated into the jaws.

The Devonian period (about 360 to 400 million years ago) has been called the "age of fishes," when the placoderms and another group of jawed fishes called acanthodians radiated and many new forms evolved in both fresh and salt water. Placoderms and acanthodians dwindled and disappeared almost completely by the beginning of the Carboniferous period, about 360 million years ago. An ancestor common to the placoderms and acanthodians may also have given rise to sharks and bony fishes some 425 to 450 million years ago. Sharks and bony fishes are currently the main vertebrates in the watery two-thirds of the surface of Earth.
