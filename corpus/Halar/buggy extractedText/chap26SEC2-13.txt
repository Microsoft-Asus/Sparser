 Natural selection could refine protobionts containing hereditary information

The packaging of primitive RNA genes and their polypeptide products within a membrane would have been a significant milestone in the early history of life. Once this occurred, protobionts could have evolved as units, and molecular cooperation could be refined because components that interacted in ways favorable to the success of the protobiont as a whole were concentrated together in a microscopic volume rather than being spread throughout the surroundings (FIGURE 26.13). Suppose, for example, that an RNA molecule ordered amino acids into a primitive enzyme that extracted energy from inorganic sulfur compounds taken up from the surroundings. This energy could be used for other reactions within the protobiont, including replication of RNA. Natural selection could favor such a gene only if its product were kept close by, rather than being shared with competing RNA sequences in its environment. The most successful protobionts would grow and split, distributing copies of their genes to offspring. Even if only one such protobiont arose initially by the abiotic processes that have been described, its descendants would vary because of mutations, errors in the copying of RNA.

Evolution in the true Darwinian sense--differential reproductive success of varied individuals--presumably accumulated many refinements to primitive metabolism and inheritance. One trend apparently led to DNA becoming the hereditary material. Initially, RNA could have provided the template on which DNA nucleotides were assembled. But DNA is a much more stable repository for genetic information than RNA, and once DNA appeared, RNA molecules would have begun to take on their modern roles as intermediates in the translation of genetic programs. The "RNA world" gave way to a "DNA world."
