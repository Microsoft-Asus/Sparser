KIEV , August 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Ukrainian government has adopted a whole package of preventive measures in response to Russia 's worsening financial crisis and a devalued ruble , Ukrainian Vice Minister of Economy Leonid Minin said Thursday .
However , he said it is not yet time to make all the documents public as they may affect the country 's relationship with Russia .
The first measure to be taken , he said , is to `` restrict the circulation of the ruble . ''
Ukrainian businesses are advised to settle accounts with their Russian trade partners in convertible currencies and to rewrite their contracts with Russian firms immediately .
If the ruble continues to devalue drastically , Minin said , Ukraine will have to introduce more thorough measures including imposing restrictions on trade with Russia , which accounts for 40 percent of Ukraine 's entire foreign trade .
Since Ukraine has suffered considerably from the ruble devaluation , it may have to request rescheduling of its debts with Russia , which reportedly has topped 2 billion U.S. dollars .
