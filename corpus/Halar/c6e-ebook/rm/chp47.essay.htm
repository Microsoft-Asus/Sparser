									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">Evolution in both insects and vertebrates has involved the repeated duplication of body segments, followed by the fusion of some segments and specialization of their structure and function. What parts of vertebrate anatomy reflect the vertebrate segmentation pattern? Can you guess what vertebrate body part is a product of segment fusion and specialization?</p>

									<a name="para98"></a><p class="BlockText">The "snout" of a frog tadpole bears a sucker. A salamander tadpole has a mustache-shaped structure called a balancer in the same area. You perform an experiment in which you transplant ectoderm from the side of a young salamander embryo to the snout of a frog embryo. You find that the tadpole that develops has a balancer. When you transplant ectoderm from the side of a slightly older salamander embryo to the snout of a frog embryo, the frog tadpole ends up with a patch of salamander skin on its snout. Suggest a hypothesis to explain the results of this experiment in terms of the mechanisms of development. How might you test your hypothesis?</p>

									<a name="para100"></a><p class="BlockText">Nerve cells transplanted from aborted fetuses can relieve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, a brain disorder. Fetal tissue transplants might also be used to treat epilepsy, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and spinal cord injuries. Why might tissues from a fetus be particularly useful for replacing diseased or damaged cells? There is controversy over whether the U.S. government should allow fetal tissues from induced abortions to be used in transplant research. Opponents would allow only tissues from miscarriages to be used. Why would most researchers prefer to use tissues from surgically aborted fetuses? What is your position on this issue, and why?</p>
