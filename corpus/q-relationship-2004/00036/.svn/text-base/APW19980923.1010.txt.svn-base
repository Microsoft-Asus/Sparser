China 's foreign minister again appealed for his country 's entry into the World Trade Organization , citing China 's efforts to stabilize the Asian economic crisis and the opening of its markets for more business `` China is already qualified for entry , regrettably , negotiations have dragged on and on , '' Tang Jiaxuan told the U.N. General Assembly in a speech that also outlined Beijing 's firm stance on Taiwan and the intent to protect human rights .
China has been lobbying for 12 years for entry into the WTO , the main international body governing global trade relations and setting fair trade rules .
There is general agreement China should join the organization and be bound by its responsibilities , but there is disagreement on the conditions of entry .
China wants to enter as a developing country , meaning it would have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of goods and services .
The United States , which has a big trade deficit with China , and other major traders have refused to let China in unless Beijing opens its markets wider .
China is striving `` to keep abreast of economic globalization and will be even more active in opening up to the world , '' Tang said .
Since the Asian financial crisis began in July 1997 , China has resisted pressure to devalue its currency , the renminbi , `` for which we have endured great pressure and paid a heavy price , '' he said .
China 's exports -- a driving force in its economy -- rose a sluggish 7.6 percent during the first half of the year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">China is especially concerned that Taiwan -- which Beijing views as a renegade province -- may enter the WTO before China .
`` Taiwan is an inalienable part of China 's territory , '' Tang said .</ENAMEX>
`` The successful return of Hong Kong and the upcoming return of Macao provide useful inspiration for settlement of the Taiwan question . ''
In his speech , Tang also promoted the idea of China as a supporter of human rights -- despite its campaign to crack down on dissidents .
Next month , China plans to sign a U.N. declaration on human rights , which `` testifies to the resolve of the Chinese government in promoting and protecting human rights , '' Tang said .
`` Earth -shaking changes have taken place in China in the past two decades , '' he said .
The Chinese people are enjoying `` a higher degree of freedom and equality than ever before . ''
He also called for better efforts to end nuclear proliferation and urged dialogue and negotiations to stop conflicts in Kosovo , Kashmir , Africa and the Middle East .
China , itself a nuclear power , `` urges countries with the largest arsenals to accelerate the nuclear disarmament process . ''
