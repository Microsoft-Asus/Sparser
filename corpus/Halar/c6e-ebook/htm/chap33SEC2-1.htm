Of the 9,000 or so species of sponges, only about 100 live in fresh water; the rest are marine. The body of a simple sponge resembles a sac perforated with holes (<span class="Emphasis1">Porifera</span> means pore bearer; <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.2</span>). Water is drawn through the pores into a central cavity, the <span class="Emphasis2">spongocoel,</span> then flows out of the sponge through a larger opening called the <span class="Emphasis2">osculum.</span> More complex sponges have folded body walls, and many contain branched water canals and several oscula. Under certain conditions, the cells around the pores and osculum contract, closing the openings.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-2','../fig/big/fig33-2.jpg','fig33-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-2.jpg" alt="fig33-2" name="myfig33-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A sponge.</span> Sessile animals without specialized organs and tissues, sponges filter food from water pumped through their porous bodies.

Sponges trap food from the water circulated through the porous body. To obtain enough food to grow by 100 g (about 3 ounces), a sponge must filter 1,000 kg (about 275 gallons) of seawater. Lining the inside of the spongocoel or internal water chambers are flagellated <span class="Emphasis2">choanocytes,</span> or collar cells (for the membranous collar around the base of the flagellum). The flagella generate a water current, and the collars trap food particles that the choanocytes then ingest by phagocytosis (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.3</span>). The similarity between choanocytes and the cells of choanoflagellates reinforces the molecular evidence in supporting the hypothesis of an animal origin from a choanoflagellate ancestor.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-3','../fig/big/fig33-3.jpg','fig33-3');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-3.jpg" alt="fig33-3" name="myfig33-3"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-3.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Anatomy of a sponge.</span> The wall of this simple sponge has two layers of cells separated by a gelatinous matrix, the mesohyl ("middle matter"). The outer layer consists of tightly packed epidermal cells. The incurrent pores are channels through porocytes, cells shaped like elongated doughnuts that span the body wall. The spongocoel is lined mainly by choanocytes, each with a flagellum ringed by a collar of fingerlike projections coated with mucus. Beating flagella sweep large volumes of water (arrows) into the body through the incurrent pores. Food particles are trapped in mucus on the collar, phagocytosed, and digested within choanocytes and adjacent amoebocytes. Mobile amoebocytes transport nutrients to other cells of the body and also produce materials for skeletal fibers (spicules).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The body of a sponge consists of two layers of cells separated by a gelatinous region called the <span class="Emphasis2">mesohyl.</span> Wandering through the mesohyl are cells called <span class="Emphasis2">amoebocytes,</span> named for their use of pseudopodia. Amoebocytes have many functions. They take up food from the water and from choanocytes, digest it, and carry nutrients to other cells. Amoebocytes also form tough skeletal fibers within the mesohyl. In some groups of sponges, these fibers are sharp spicules made from calcium carbonate or silica; other sponges produce more flexible fibers composed of a collagen protein called spongin. We use these pliant, honeycombed skeletons as bath sponges.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Most sponges are <span class="Emphasis2">hermaphrodites</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">Hermes</span>, the god, and <span class="Emphasis1">Aphrodite</span>, the goddess), meaning that each individual functions as both male and female in sexual reproduction by producing sperm <span class="Emphasis1">and</span> eggs. Gametes arise from choanocytes or amoebocytes. Eggs reside in the mesohyl, but sperm cells are carried out of the sponge by the water current. Cross-fertilization results from some of the sperm being drawn into neighboring individuals. Fertilization occurs in the mesohyl, where the zygotes develop into flagellated, swimming larvae that disperse from the parent. Upon settling on a suitable substratum, a larva develops into the sessile adult.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Sponges are capable of extensive regeneration, the replacement of lost parts.
