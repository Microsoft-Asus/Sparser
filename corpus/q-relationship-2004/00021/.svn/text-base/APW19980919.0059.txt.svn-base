Congolese President Laurent Kabila has flown to Libya , violating U.N. sanctions banning air travel to the North African country , Libya television reported .
Kabila 's arrival Friday makes him the sixth African leader to have flown directly to Libya this month in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">an Organization of African Unity decision to no longer honor the air embargo</ENAMEX> .
The U.N. Security Council expressed its concern Friday that African statesmen were repeatedly violating the sanctions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Kabila expressed his support for the OAU policy , saying the Congo believes `` the imposition of the embargo against Libya is unjust</ENAMEX> , '' the television said , according to a British Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the broadcast received in Cairo .
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
The sanctions also bar arms sales , freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry equipment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">At its June summit , the OAU urged members to ignore the embargo when traveling to Libya for humanitarian or official reasons</ENAMEX> .
The U.N. -approved mode of travel is for visitors to fly to Tunisia and cross overland into Libya .
Libyan television said Kabila , who was accompanied by justice minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo , went straight from the airport to meet Gadhafi .
Kabila , whose government is fighting a rebellion in eastern Congo , said he hoped to `` exchange views -LRB- with Gadhafi -RRB- on some issues of interest to the African continent . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANSWER">Libya asked the Arab League this week to join the OAU in ignoring the sanctions</ENAMEX> .
But the League decided , at a meeting of its foreign ministers in Cairo , to adhere to the sanctions until an agreement is reached with Libya on handing over the Lockerbie suspects .
Libya 's Foreign Minister Omar al- Muntasser denounced the League 's decision as a `` joke '' .
The U.N. Security Council endorsed a U.S. - British plan for the suspects to be tried in the Netherlands .
Libya agreed in principle , but has demanded negotiations to ensure the suspects ' legal rights and safety .
The United States and Britain have said the offer is non-negotiable .
The Security Council said the sanctions would be suspended when the suspects were turned over for trial .
