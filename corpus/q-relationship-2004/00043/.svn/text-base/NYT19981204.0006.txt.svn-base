AUSTIN --
In one of the advertisements aired before his smashing victory in last month 's election , Governor George Bush of Texas could be seen , upright and with a sober expression , inspecting a forlorn parade of juvenile offenders .
The lineup took place at a `` Tough Love Academy , '' the local euphemism for a boot camp .
Such academies lick errant youth into shape the old-fashioned way .
Offenders are stripped , shaved , dressed in orange jail-garb , and hustled through something like army drill with doses of Bible study .
It is hard punishment , but at least the aim is rehabilitation .
Not so in the state 's prisons .
Texas has spent over $ 2 billion to lock up offenders in new prisons and keep them there .
Rehabilitation is an afterthought , and that suits most Texans .
The state has the highest rate of incarceration in the country : a Texan is seven times more likely than a Minnesotan to find himself behind bars .
And the hard-line approach -LRB- helped no doubt by a booming economy -RRB- seems to be working .
Crime in the Lone Star state is at a 20-year low .
Murders last year , politicians proudly report , were down 10 percent from 1996 .
Yet long sentences without parole offer little incentive for good behavior .
Texas prisons , murky hells at the best of times , are getting more violent , and the violent are getting more organized .
Increasingly , inmates find hope and purpose in a potentially devastating form of organized crime , prison gangs .
These gangs were founded for self-protection : protection from rape , assault and being cut open in the showers .
Federal prison reforms were partly responsible for their growth .
A 1976 ruling allowed inmates in other prisons to write to each other , creating the structure that characterizes prison gangs .
A 1979 ruling desegregated prison cells , and the ensuing racial tensions saw gangs gather around their racial and ethnic banners .
Then in 1982 came the abolition of the `` building-tender '' system .
Building -tenders were mostly older white inmates , who were set up like prefects at a British boarding school to enforce order among other inmates .
Gangs grew in the vacuum they left .
Nearly 5 percent of Latino inmates in Texas -- and around 15 percent of the known or suspected gang members in Texas jails -- belong to the Mexican Mafia , the state 's biggest prison gang .
Members style themselves Emes -LRB- pronounced `` eemmee '' after the Spanish letter M -RRB- .
They organized in the early 1980s to protect Latino inmates from racial attacks .
Today they are opportunistic racketeers .
Emes deal in chiva -LRB- heroin -RRB- , mota -LRB- marijuana -RRB- , soda -LRB- cocaine -RRB- and compadres for those who want to knock boots -LRB- have sex -RRB- .
`` We will traffic in drugs , contracts of assassination , prostitution , and robbery of high magnitude , '' says the Mexican Mafia 's businesslike constitution .
Since their tentative early days , the Emes have coalesced into a fraternity for hard-line criminals .
The gang now coordinates drug deals on the streets of Texan barrios from inside the state 's jails .
`` It 's organized crime , no different from the gang warfare that took place in Chicago in the 1930s , '' says Allan Polunsky , the chairman of the Texas prison board .
Unlike loud and loosely organized street gangs , prison gangs tend to be secretive and highly structured .
Street gangs drift apart as their members get older ; prison gangs are committed for life .
Street gangs are often riven by feuds ; prison gangs are characterized by respect .
Discipline is ruthlessly enforced .
A member of the Texas Syndicate -- the rival Latino prison gang to the Mexican Mafia -- was shot dead in his Austin home last year when gang bosses suspected him of snitching to the police .
Intelligence reports repeatedly describe prison gangs as coldhearted , loyal , violent and without boundaries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Slowly , too , these gangs are getting out of prison and making their presence felt on the street</ENAMEX> .
Of 30,000 inmates released on parole from Texas state prisons in 1997 , 3,000 had some gang affiliation .
Sixteen Emes were indicted in San Antonio recently on racketeering charges .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Police say the gang has been responsible for 14 murders in San Antonio , including the city 's worst mass murder in which Emes killed five people</ENAMEX> .
Gangs move into the barrios , where they enforce a 10 percent street tax from small-time drug-pushers .
The money is used to support gangsters ' families and pay legal bills .
The hardest of the gangs , though , are the white supremacists , who rally around ideology rather than racketeering .
`` The white guys are solid , '' a Texas inmate explained recently to the Houston Chronicle .
`` They are the most violent in the system .
They 'll kill in a heartbeat . ''
This was bloodily demonstrated in June , when three white men lynched a black man in east Texas by chaining him to their pickup truck and dragging him behind it .
Two of the killers -LRB- though not the third , who claimed no white supremacist links -RRB- had apparently picked up their violent racism in jail .
There are at least 425 members of the Aryan Brotherhood in Texas prisons .
The gang was founded in California 's San Quentin in the 1960s with the motto , `` Kill to get in , die to get out . ''
Many more white inmates have been linked with the KKK and the Aryan Circle , which are officially listed as groups rather than gangs .
Reformed white supremacists say prison is the primary recruiting ground for neo- Nazis .
The large numbers of blacks in jails , who often speak an impenetrable street dialect , provides an easy excuse for hatred .
To fight the gangs , parole boards are now obliged to take gang membership into account when releasing criminals .
Gangsters are closely monitored with an electronic bracelet , and their telltale tattoos are photographed upon release .
Later , these can be checked for new gangster markings .
But when it comes to curbing the growth of gangs , there is little the state can do .
Its own vigilance in locking up violent offenders has spawned crime syndicates , ruthlessly organized and racially segregated , which make Al Capone look soft .
