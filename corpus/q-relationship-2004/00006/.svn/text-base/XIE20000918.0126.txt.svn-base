TEHRAN , September 18 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Iranian navy is about to launch a mini vessel that will operate both as a rocket-launcher and as a destroyer , the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday .
Quoting Vice Admiral Abdollah Maanavi , a naval officer , the agency said the vessel will be launched on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1980-1988 Iran - Iraq war .
The anniversary is to be observed for one week starting Thursday .
The vessel is aimed to protect the country 's water borders in view of the fact that over 90 percent of its imported goods enter the country by ship , Maanavi said .
He noted that more than 70 percent of the body of the ship was built by Iranian experts , but declining to name other countries that helped in the building of the vessel .
The officer referred to the 1988 attack by the United States on Iran 's oil platforms and ships in the Persian Gulf , which , he said , was the stimulus behind the building of the destroyer -LRB- and rocket launcher -RRB- .
Maanavi , however , noted that economic sanctions imposed by developed countries still exist and prevent Iran from making necessary purchases of parts .
But Iran has made eye-opening improvements on naval facilities , he added , pointing to the full-scale development of missile systems , long-range anti-aircraft launchers and computerized operations .
Last month Iran launched its first domestically-manufactured mini submarine intended to transport commandos and lay mines in the waters of the Persian Gulf .
The Alsabehat -15 submarine , which can accommodate a two-man crew and up to three divers , is capable of being used in various operations close to enemy territory such as making reconnaissance patrols and dropping commandos , planting mines and guiding artillery guns , the officer said .
The bitter eight-year war against Iraq made Iran decide to implement a drive for self-sufficiency in weapons manufacture , he added .
