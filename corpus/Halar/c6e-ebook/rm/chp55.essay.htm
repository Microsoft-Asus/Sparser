									<a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">You learned in this chapter that while extinction is a natural process, the current high rate of extinction caused by human disturbance to world ecosystems is of great concern. What are the implications of this rapid extinction rate for the restoration of biological diversity in the future, as compared with the far slower extinction rates that characterized much of the past history of Earth?</p>

									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">Suppose that you are in charge of planning a forest reserve, and one of your main goals is to help sustain locally beleaguered populations of woodland birds. Parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird is an escalating problem in the area. Reading research reports, you note that female cowbirds are usually reluctant to penetrate more than about 100 m into a forest and that some woodland birds are known to reduce cowbird nest parasitism by restricting their nesting to the denser, more central regions of forests. The forested area you have to work with is about 1,000 m by 6,000 m. A recent logging operation removed about half of the trees on one of the 6,000-m sides; the other three sides are adjacent to deforested pastureland. Your plan must include space for a small maintenance building, which you estimate to take up about 100 m<SUP>2</SUP>. It will also be necessary to build a road, 10 m by 1,000 m, across the reserve. Where would you construct the road and the building, and why?</p>

									<a name="para93"></a><p class="BlockText">Some organizations are starting to envision a sustainable society--one in which each generation inherits sufficient natural and economic resources and a relatively stable environment. The Worldwatch Institute, an environmental policy organization, estimates that we must reach sustainability by the year 2030 to avoid economic and environmental disaster. To get there, we must begin shaping a sustainable society during the next ten years or so. In what ways is our current system not sustainable? What might we do to work toward sustainability, and what are the major roadblocks to achieving it? How would your life be different in a sustainable society?</p>
