HEARING AND EQUILIBRIUM

 

 The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear



 

 The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium



 

 A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians



 

 Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive



Hearing and the perception of body equilibrium, or balance, are related in most animals. Both involve the formation of sensations by mechanoreceptors containing hair cells that produce receptor potentials when the hairs are bent by settling particles or moving fluid. In mammals and most other terrestrial vertebrates, the sensory organs for hearing and equilibrium are closely associated within fluid-filled canals in the ear.
