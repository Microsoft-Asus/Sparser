LOS ANGELES --
The EgyptAir crash could not have come at a worse time for Boeing , producer of the 767-300ER plane that went down off Nantucket .
The company , once the undisputed market leader in commercial aircraft , needs all the help it can find to avoid losing more orders , particularly to the European consortium Airbus .
A crash can only focus embarrassing attention on its commercial and manufacturing woes .
The day before the crash , the company came in for sharp criticism from U.S. safety regulators for its conduct after the crash of TWA Flight 800 three years ago off Long Island .
The engine was a Boeing 747 and investigations excluded initial theories that the plane was the victim of a terrorist bomb or shot out of the sky by a stray missile from a nearby U.S. testing area .
Experts now believe that the crash was caused by a catastrophic explosion of the central fuel tanks , which had taken in heat from air-conditioning units beneath them , although investigators have not established exactly how the vapours ignited .
What the U.S. federal investigators did not know was that an internal Boeing inquiry had broached just such a possibility in 1980 , 16 years before TWA Flight 800 crashed .
They found this out only in June this year , as was confirmed this weekend .
Commercially , latest statistics suggest that Airbus is outselling Boeing by a 2-1 margin this year , the first time the Europeans have managed to beat the Seattle -based giant so significantly and only the fourth time that Boeing has been forced to take second place in the commercial sales table .
In the first nine months of 1999 , Airbus signed orders for 343 aircraft , including 64 widebodied planes .
Boeing had 154 signed orders , 35 of them widebodies .
The most disappointing aspect for Boeing was the performance of its new long-range 777 , which lost out to the Airbus 330-200 in a major order placed by El Al , the Israeli airline , last week .
Another design , the Boeing 717 , has also largely been overlooked in favor of the Airbus A318 .
A year ago the company decided to emphasize profits rather than market share .
The company is reluctant to secure contracts by offering big discounts and prefers to concentrate on accounts that bring in the money .
That strategy , when combined with a concerted program of job cuts and cost-slashing , has improved the balance sheet -- net income for the first six months of this year was $ 1.17 billion compared with $ 308 million a year earlier -- but the moves have failed to stem the loss of orders .
Analysts say Boeing is still suffering from production lags from 1997 .
Although the backlog has now been cleared , the perception of inefficiency remains .
Another problabor relations .
Faced with a possible machine operators ' strike in September , the company simply caved in on the main negotiating points , offering big pay rises and a promise to restrict outsourcing to other companies .
