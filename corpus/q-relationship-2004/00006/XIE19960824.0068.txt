WASHINGTON , August 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russia 's development of nuclear weapons is facing some troubles and the number of its nuclear warheads is likely to drop to about 3,500 by 2005 whether it ratifies the U.S. - Russia START - II treaty or not .
The statement was made today by General Eugene Habiger , commander of U.S. nuclear forces , while meeting with reporters .
He also said that Russia was developing four new nuclear weapons but only one of them , the SS -27 single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile , was going smoothly .
`` The other three are not , '' Habiger said without giving details .
The general predicted that Russia 's efforts to develop a new submarine-launched nuclear missile , a nuclear missile-firing submarine and a nuclear cruise missile were not proceeding `` as quickly as you would have seen 10 years ago . ''
`` Even if they developed those systems , there would n't be the capability , the dollars , the resources to bring up their force structure ... that 's going to just run out of shelf life or capability , '' he said .
Under the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START - II -RRB- , both the United States and Russia should reduce their nuclear weapons to between 3,000 and 3,500 each by 2003 .
