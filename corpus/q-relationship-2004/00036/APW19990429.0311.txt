TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- At odds with China on most fronts , Taiwan has found a common quest with its rival : the desire for membership in the World Trade Organization .
For years , Taiwan has maintained it is as important as China when it comes to world trade , so its application for membership in the international trade group should be treated separately .
But as China has drawn closer to entry , Taiwan has decided to pin its hopes of joining the WTO on China 's coattails .
Taiwan has completed all trade negotiations required by WTO members , and is continuing its own lobbying efforts .
Taiwanese Economics Minister Wang Chih -kang departs for Washington on Monday to seek U.S. support of Taiwan 's entry this year .
But the nation believes its admission is stalled because WTO members do n't want to risk the ire of China , which claims sovereignty over Taiwan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Beijing insists that it must get into the WTO first , then Taiwan can follow as long as the island is admitted as a `` tariff zone '' and not as a nation .</ENAMEX>
`` We hope relevant parties will observe this , '' said Sun Yuxi , China 's Foreign Ministry spokesman .
Separated politically since a civil war in 1949 , Taiwan and China do not recognize each other , and Taiwan has refused official contacts with Beijing .
As a global outcast , Taiwan hopes WTO membership could give it more international exposure .
Taiwan is denied preferential tariff treatments by most countries and access to international arbitration of trade disputes -- benefits it hopes to gain through WTO membership .
China has stepped up its drive for WTO membership and offered substantial concessions to lower trade barriers in areas ranging from telecommunications to insurance .
Continued worries over China 's concessions in financial services , steel and textile businesses prompted President Clinton to lobby against China 's membership earlier this month .
Still , WTO secretary-general Renato Ruggiero says China might qualify for membership as early as November .
That came as a great relief to Taiwan 's WTO negotiators .
Membership is so appealing to Taiwan that officials are casting aside concerns that a WTO spot could draw Beijing closer to Washington and thus imperil Taiwan 's political interests .
Taiwan even indicated it could negotiate with China to remove trade barriers against Chinese goods once both are admitted .
After Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to concessions when visiting Washington early this month , Taiwanese President Lee Teng -hui said the two sides could talk about trade and agriculture cooperation once both are in .
`` We have an open mind , and we are willing to talk about many issues , '' Lee said .
With both in the WTO , Taiwan is bound to face escalating pressure to ease trade barriers against Chinese farm goods , allow Chinese firms to invest in Taiwan and end its ban on air and shipping links .
Meanwhile , Taiwanese economists expect China to open its markets further in exchange for foreign capital and technology .
One persistent fear is that China will balk if Western countries demand more severe trade concessions , thereby dampen Taiwan 's hopes of joining .
Also , amid U.S. complaints about a growing trade deficit , Taiwan fears further delays would give Washington a chance to reopen trade negotiations with stricter demands .
Taiwan has already made concessions on U.S. pork imports and car imports from other countries .
`` We have already suffered trade losses but have yet to enjoy any benefits , '' said Kuo Weng -cheng , an economist at the Chunghwa Institute of Economic Research .
`` Public support for WTO accession would drop if we ca n't be admitted this year . ''
