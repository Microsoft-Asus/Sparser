LONDON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- HSBC Holdings PLC will boost its stake in the high-margin business of catering to rich depositors with the $ 10.3 billion purchase of the company that controls Republic National Bank of New York .
HSBC , which already controls Marine Midland Bank in the United States , will double the size of its private banking portfolio under the $ 72-a-share deal announced Monday .
At the same time , it will increase its share of the American commercial banking market , operating the third-largest branch network in New York state .
The purchase includes Republic New York Corp. and its sister company , Safra Republic Holdings SA .
Safra is the holding company for banks in Switzerland , France , Luxembourg , Gibraltar , Monaco and Guernsey , one of the Channel Islands .
Neil Baker of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson described the deal as a sensible , `` low risk '' acquisition for HSBC , which also controls the No. 1 bank in Hong Kong -- Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. -- and Midland Bank , the fourth-largest in Britain .
`` It 's a good deal .
I do n't think they 're overpaying , '' said Hugh Pye , an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities .
Republic National Bank and Marine Midland make a good fit , and consolidation of their back-office operations should yield cost savings , Pye said .
London -based HSBC said it expects the acquisitions to lead to annual savings of $ 300 million within two years .
The acquisitions will add 30,000 private banking clients with total funds of $ 56.5 billion .
Private banking is individualized banking for wealthy investors , a profitable business in which Republic is seen to have a strong market niche .
HSBC Group chairman John Bond said the acquisitions reflect the company 's strategy of balancing its activities between developing countries and more advanced nations .
`` They will also significantly enhance our position in the world 's largest economy , giving us an additional 1 million customers in a mature and stable market , '' he said , referring to the United States .
HSBC said it will pay for the acquisitions in part with money raised from the sale of $ 3 billion in stock .
The company will take after-tax restructuring charges of $ 450 million in 1999 and 2000 .
The deal still requires approval from Republic New York shareholders and regulatory authorities in the United States , Britain , Hong Kong and other jurisdictions .
HSBC hopes to complete the acquisition by the end of the year , spokesman Adrian Russell said .
HSBC Holdings earned $ 4.32 billion last year .
