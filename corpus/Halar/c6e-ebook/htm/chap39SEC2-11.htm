This first defense system, however, is not impenetrable. Viruses, bacteria, and the spores and hyphae of fungi can enter the plant through injuries or through natural openings in the epidermis, such as stomata. Once a pathogen invades, the plant mounts a chemical attack as a second line of defense that kills the pathogens and prevents their spread from the site of infection. This second defense system is enhanced by the plant’s inherited ability to recognize certain pathogens.</p><p class="Header3">Gene-for-Gene Recognition</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Plants are generally resistant to most pathogens. This is because plants have an innate ability to recognize invading pathogens and to mount successful defenses. In a converse manner, successful pathogens cause disease because they are able to evade recognition or suppress host defense mechanisms. Pathogens against which a plant has little specific defense are said to be virulent. They are the exceptions, for if they were not, then hosts and pathogens would soon perish together. A kind of "compromise" has coevolved between plants and most of their pathogens. In such cases, the pathogen gains enough access to its host to perpetuate itself without severely damaging or killing the plant. Such strains of pathogens are termed <span class="Emphasis2">avirulent.</span></p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Specific resistance to a plant disease is based on what is called <span class="Emphasis2">gene-for-gene recognition,</span> because it depends on a precise match-up between a genetic allele in the plant and an allele in the pathogen. This occurs when a plant with specific dominant resistance alleles (<span class="Emphasis1">R</span>) recognizes those pathogens that possess complementary avirulence (<span class="Emphasis1">Avr</span>) alleles (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.30</span>). Specific recognition induces expression of certain plant genes, the products of which mount a defense against the pathogen. If the plant host does not contain the appropriate <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> gene, the pathogen can invade and kill the plant. There are many pathogens, and plants have many <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> genes--<span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> has at least several hundred.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-30','../fig/big/fig39-30.jpg','fig39-30');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-30.jpg" alt="fig39-30" name="myfig39-30"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-30.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Gene-for-gene resistance of plants to pathogens.

The product of an <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> gene is probably a specific receptor protein inside a plant cell or at its surface. The <span class="Emphasis1">Avr</span> gene probably leads to production of some "signal" molecule from the pathogen, a ligand capable of binding specifically to the plant cell’s receptor. The <span class="Emphasis1">Avr</span> product undoubtedly has some function upon which the pathogen itself depends, but the plant is able to "key" on this molecule as an announcement of the pathogen’s presence. Binding of the ligand to the receptor triggers a signal-transduction pathway leading to a defense response in the infected plant tissue. This defense includes both an enhancement of the localized response at the site of infection and a more general systemic response of the whole plant.</p><p class="Header3">Hypersensitive Response</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Even if a plant is infected by a virulent strain of a pathogen--one for which that particular plant has no genetic resistance--the plant is able to mount a localized chemical attack in response to molecular signals released from cells damaged by the infection. Molecules called <span class="Emphasis2">elicitors,</span> often cellulose fragments called <span class="Emphasis2">oligosaccharins</span> released by cell-wall damage, induce the production of antimicrobial compounds called <span class="Emphasis2">phytoalexins.</span> Infection also activates genes that produce <span class="Emphasis2">PR proteins</span> (for pathogenesis-related). Some of these proteins are antimicrobial, attacking molecules in the cell wall of a bacterium, for example. Others may function as signals that spread "news" of the infection to nearby cells. Infection also stimulates cross-linking of molecules in the cell wall and deposition of lignin, responses that set up a local barricade that slows spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">If the pathogen is avirulent based on an <span class="Emphasis1">R-Avr</span> match, the localized defense response is more vigorous and is called a <span class="Emphasis2">hypersensitive response</span> (abbreviated <span class="Emphasis2">HR</span>). There is an enhanced production of phytoalexins and PR proteins, and the "sealing" response that contains the infection is more effective. After cells at the site of infection mount their chemical defense and seal off the area, they destroy themselves. We can see the result of an HR as lesions on a leaf or other infected organ. As "sick" as such a leaf appears, it will survive, and its defense response will help protect the rest of the plant (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.31</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-31','../fig/big/fig39-31.jpg','fig39-31');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-31.jpg" alt="fig39-31" name="myfig39-31"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-31.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Defense responses against an avirulent pathogen.</span></span></td></tr></table><p class="Header3">Systemic Acquired Resistance</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The hypersensitive response, as you have learned, is localized and specific, a containment response based on gene-for-gene (<span class="Emphasis1">R-Avr</span>) recognition between host and pathogen. However, this defense response also includes production of chemical signals that "sound the alarm" of infection to the whole plant. Released from the site of infection, the alarm hormones are transported throughout the plant, stimulating production of phytoalexins and PR proteins. This response, called <span class="Emphasis2">systemic acquired resistance (SAR),</span> is nonspecific, providing protection against a diversity of pathogens for days (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.31</span>).</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">A good candidate for one of the hormones responsible for activating SAR is <span class="Emphasis2">salicylic acid.</span> A modified form of this compound, acetylsalicylic acid, is the active ingredient in aspirin. Centuries before aspirin was sold as a pain reliever, some cultures had learned that chewing the bark of a willow tree <span class="Emphasis1">(Salix)</span> would lessen the pain of a toothache or headache. With the discovery of systemic acquired resistance, biologists have finally learned one function of salicylic acid in plants. Aspirin turns out to be a natural medicine in the plants that produce it, but with effects entirely different from the medicinal action in humans who consume the drug.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Plant biologists investigating disease resistance and other evolutionary adaptations of plants are getting to the heart of how a plant responds to internal and external signals. These scientists, along with thousands of other plant biologists working on other questions and millions of students experimenting with plants in biology courses, are all extending a centuries-old tradition of curiosity about the green organisms that feed the biosphere.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
