Arthropods and most mollusks have open circulatory systems, in which tissues are bathed directly in hemolymph pumped by a heart into sinuses. Annelids, some mollusks, and vertebrates have closed circulatory systems, with blood confined to vessels and pumped by muscular hearts.</p></LI><LI><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Vertebrate phylogeny is reflected in adaptations of the cardiovascular system (pp. 873-875,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.3</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> In vertebrates, blood flows in a closed cardiovascular system consisting of blood vessels and a two- to four-chambered heart. The heart has one atrium or two atria, which receive blood from veins, and one or two ventricles, which pump blood into arteries. Arteries convey blood to capillaries, the sites of chemical exchange between blood and interstitial fluid. Veins return blood from capillaries to the heart. In fishes, the heart has a single atrium and a single ventricle that pumps blood to gills for oxygenation; the blood then travels to other capillary beds of the body before returning to the heart. Amphibians and most reptiles have a three-chambered heart in which the single ventricle pumps blood via two circuits to gas exchange surfaces and to other parts of the body. The two circuits return blood to separate atria. This double circulation re-pumps blood returning from the capillary beds of the respiratory organ, thus ensuring a strong flow of blood to the rest of the body. Birds and mammals, both endotherms, have four-chambered hearts that keep oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood completely separated.</p></LI><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Double circulation in mammals depends on the anatomy and pumping cycle of the heart (pp. 875-877,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 42.4</span>-<span class="SmallCap">42-7</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Heart valves dictate a one-way flow of blood through the heart. The heart rate (pulse) is the number of times the heart beats each minute. The cardiac cycle, one complete sequence of the heart’s pumping and filling, consists of periods of contraction, called systole, and periods of relaxation, called diastole. The cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped into the systemic circulation per minute. The intrinsic contraction rhythm of cardiac muscle is coordinated by a conduction system originating in the sinoatrial (SA) node (pacemaker) of the right atrium. The pacemaker is influenced by nerves, hormones, body temperature, and exercise.</p></LI><LI><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Structural differences of arteries, veins, and capillaries correlate with their different functions (pp. 877-878,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 42.8</span>, <span class="SmallCap">42.9</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> An endothelium lines all blood vessels, including the capillaries. Arteries and veins have two additional outer layers composed of smooth muscle, elastic fibers, and connective tissue. Arteries have the thickest, strongest, and most elastic walls, accommodating high blood pressure and rapid blood flow. Body movements propel blood back to the heart in veins; large veins are equipped with one-way valves.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity42A:<span class="Emphasis1">

This slower flow enhances the exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Blood pressure, the hydrostatic force blood exerts against the wall of a vessel, is determined by the cardiac output and peripheral resistance due to variable constriction of the arterioles.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Biology Labs On-Line: <span class="Emphasis1">CardioLab</span></span></p></LI><LI><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Transfer of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid occurs across the thin walls of capillaries (pp. 880-881,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 42.12</span>, <span class="SmallCap">42.13</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The supply of blood to different organs is determined by variable constriction of arterioles and precapillary sphincters.

Plasma is a complex aqueous solution of inorganic electrolytes, proteins, nutrients, metabolic waste products, respiratory gases, and hormones. Plasma proteins influence blood pH, osmotic pressure, and viscosity, and function in lipid transport, immunity (antibodies), and blood clotting (fibrinogens). Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, transport oxygen. Five types of white blood cells, or leukocytes, function in defense by phagocytosing bacteria and debris or by producing antibodies. Pluripotent stem cells in red bone marrow give rise to all types of blood cells. Platelets function in blood clotting, a cascade of complex reactions that converts plasma fibrinogen to fibrin.</p></LI><LI><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States and most other developed nations (pp. 884-886,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.17</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Cardiovascular disease is a deterioration of the heart and blood vessels.

Most terrestrial vertebrates, land snails, and spiders have internal lungs. In mammals, air inhaled through the nostrils passes through the pharynx into the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and dead-end alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. Lungs must be ventilated by breathing. Frogs ventilate by positive pressure, pumping air into their lungs. Mammals ventilate with negative pressure by contracting and relaxing rib muscles and the diaphragm, which changes the volume and hence the pressure of the chest cavity and lungs relative to the atmosphere. Birds have one-way ventilation of the lungs, made possible by a system of air sacs and tubular parabronchi in the lungs.</p><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity42D:<span class="Emphasis1">
