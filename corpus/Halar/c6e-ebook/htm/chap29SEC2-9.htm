The suffix <span class="Emphasis1">wort</span> is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "herb," and liverworts and hornworts are indeed small herbaceous (nonwoody) plants named for their shapes. Mosses are the most familiar bryophytes. But some organisms commonly known as "mosses" are not really mosses or even bryophytes; these include Irish moss (a red seaweed), reindeer moss (a lichen), club mosses (pteridophytes), and Spanish moss (a flowering plant).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-15','../fig/big/fig29-15.jpg','fig29-15');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-15.jpg" alt="fig29-15" name="myfig29-15"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-15.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Bryophytes.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Note that the terms <span class="Emphasis1">Bryophyta</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">bryophyte</span> are not synonymous. Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for a certain phylum, the mosses. The term <span class="Emphasis1">bryophyte</span> refers informally to <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> the nonvascular plants--the phyla Hepatophyta, Anthocerophyta, and Bryophyta. These diverse bryophytes are not a monophyletic grouping. Gene sequence data, comparative cell structure, and other evidence indicate that liverworts, hornworts, and mosses diverged independently early in plant evolution, before the origin of vascular plants (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.1</span>). And as noted earlier, fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that bryophytes were the earliest plants. Though the identity of the modern bryophyte group most similar to the earliest plants is still uncertain, liverworts and hornworts may be the most reasonable models of what early plants were like. Most plant systematists now regard mosses as the bryophyte group most closely related to vascular plants (pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms).</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
