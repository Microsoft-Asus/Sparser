WASHINGTON --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Calling it the fulfillment of a lifelong dream , a wealthy American money manager and former rocket engineer has signed on to become the first tourist in space on a mission to the Russian space station Mir. Dennis Tito , a 59-year -old California multimillionaire , said on Monday that going into space would satisfy an ambition that he has had since childhood and was worth the price , estimated to be about $ 20 million .</ENAMEX>
`` For me , it 's a life 's dream , '' Tito told a news conference here via a telephone hookup from Moscow , where he is undergoing medical and psychological tests to see if he qualifies for spaceflight .
`` I had this dream over 40 years ago and at that time , I did n't have a penny to my name , '' he said .
Money is no longer a constraint , he said , and it is time to live out the fantasy .
`` We have one life to live on this Earth and my commitment is to fulfill all of my dreams which are healthy and legitimate , '' Tito said .
`` I am optimistic that I do have the right stuff to make this flight . ''
Tito , who has degrees in aerospace engineering and worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for five years before becoming an investment analyst , said he wanted to spend part of his time in orbit conducting special photography of the Earth using a new system he was working out .
Tito founded Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif. , in the 1970s to apply computer concepts to investment strategy , and the company now manages about $ 10 billion in assets and is best known for its Wilshire 5000 stock index .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">If all goes well , Tito could be visiting the space station Mir on a 10-day trip during the first half of next year , said officials of MirCorp , a firm in Amsterdam that is raising money to continue operating the aging Russian station .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MirCorp , which is 60 percent owned by Russian interests and 40 percent by American investors , earlier this year secured rights to commercially market the aging , 130-ton space station that the cash-starved Russian government had stopped supporting .</ENAMEX>
On Friday , two Russian astronauts returned to Earth after a 73-day , MirCorp -financed mission to Mir .
The astronauts , with the help of supplies from two cargo flights to the station , also paid for by the corporation , repaired several air leaks , replaced deteriorating batteries and revitalized the station 's life support systems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` The renovated Mir has now been declared ready for commercial flights , '' said Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria , a MirCorp director and telecommunications entrepreneur who is an investor .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MirCorp has raised about $ 100 million to support Mir , including more than $ 40 million in cash from investors and the rest in goods and services from RSC Energia , the Russian company that built and operates Mir and owns 60 percent of MirCorp , Kathuria said .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">MirCorp officials declined to say exactly now much Tito would pay for his trip , but said it was close to the $ 20 million that the firm had stated such missions would cost .</ENAMEX>
Kathuria said the company was talking with at least six other individuals who have expressed interest in a trip into space .
MirCorp 's president , Jeffrey Manber , speaking from Moscow , acknowledged that space travel was not yet routine and that his company 's `` Citizen Explorers '' program was proceeding cautiously in picking participants who could safely withstand the rigors of space .
`` This is not a game , '' Manber said .
`` We are cutting no corners here .
It is a serious business which requires serious training . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MirCorp officials said a public stock offering is expected early next year .
Several potential ventures , including television programming , advertising and promotion from space , and Internet activities also are being discussed , officials said .
Long -term plans also include opening Mir to manufacturing involving exotic materials and pharmaceuticals , and possibly using the station as a base to assemble and launch satellites .</ENAMEX>
Manber said the company will decide next month when the next flights will go up to Mir , including a timetable for Tito 's journey if he is cleared to take it .
