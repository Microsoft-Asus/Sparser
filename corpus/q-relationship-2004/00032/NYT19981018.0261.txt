And I do n't mean the names of the mutual funds or individual stocks that you own .
Nor the allocation mix of your portfolio .
Do you really thoroughly understand enough about the companies and funds on which your retirement depends ?
That 's the question Hall of Fame stockpicker Peter Lynch suggests that you ask yourself -- endlessly .
` If -LRB- investors -RRB- ca n't explain their investments to their 11-year -old or their spouse ... that 's pretty scary , '' says Lynch , vice-chairman of Boston 's Fidelity Management & Research .
Of course , Lynch was portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund , which was the premier fund under his leadership from May 1977 to May 1990 .
During his reign , the funds ' assets swelled from $ 20 million to $ 14 billion .
In today 's celebrity-driven culture , Lynch is a financial star .
Not more than a few minutes after he and his white-frock of hair entered the lobby of the Hilton Hotel near Union Square , an admirer stopped to ask him for an autograph .
He obliged without hesitation .
Like Omaha 's Warren Buffet , Lynch has his legions of fans -LRB- you know who you are -RRB- , who practice his `` invest-in-what-you-know '' philosophy over the long term .
And it 's volatile times like these that test the master 's patience with the unconverted .
When asked what he thinks of this topsy-turvy market , he somewhat exasperatingly replies : `` It 's the same today that it was a year ago , five years ago and 25 years ago . ''
Translation : The day-to-day machinations of the stock market should have little bearing on your long-term investments -LRB- which should be most of your portfolio -RRB- .
Asking how interest rate cuts might affect your stocks is like `` skiing on a double-diamond slope and wondering if it 's windy , '' he says .
Investors `` are better off owning one or two stocks and knowing them cold , -LRB- and they -RRB- should stop watching CNN all day , '' he says .
`` It should n't be this buyers-versus-sellers crap . ''
If Lynch sounds a little punchy , it 's because he 's confounded by the throngs of people who are n't spending sufficient time with their portfolios -LRB- not to mention he was in the midst of a hectic four-speech swing -RRB- .
What troubles him most are people who invest in companies without knowing what they specifically manufacture or what they do , who their customers are , what raw materials they rely on , and so on .
In short , too many folks are playing stock tips like they were trotters at the track .
`` That 's gambling , not investing , '' he says .
`` I do n't know if they 're calling the psychic hotline or what '' for some of their stock selections , he adds .
Naturally , everyone and their brother wants to know when the Dow Jones industrial average will find a bottom , and if the recent upswing is a sign that the worst is over .
But Lynch does n't bite .
`` I 've been trying to buy a subscription to next year 's Wall Street Journal for the past 25 years , '' he quips .
Seriously , Lynch is willing to address specific questions about market cycles , volatility , psychology and corrections .

The famed fund manager also acknowledges that index funds have dominated managed funds during the past few years .
However , he admonishes that no cycle lasts forever .
One thing he is rather adamant about is that large capitalization stocks will have to hit bottom and begin to rebound before beaten-down small-capitalization stocks can even begin to make a move .
In other words , small-caps ca n't rally if large-caps are tanking .
`` If big-cap stocks go down big-time , small stocks will go down big-time , '' Lynch says .
-- All - Calculator Squad : Once again , Institutional Investor magazine has released its annual ranking of sell-side financial analysts -LRB- the equity researchers who work for investment banks and brokerages -RRB- .
And once again , Merrill Lynch placed the highest number of analysts on the highly regarded publication 's All - America research team .
Goldman Sachs repeated its second-place performance of a year ago , and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was third .
Near and dear to the Bay Area 's heart are technology sector analysts .
That category was captured by Morgan Stanley , which placed 10 tech analysts on the Institutional Investor all-star squad .
The rankings , which were determined by canvassing institutional investors who deal with sell-side analysts , often give the corporate finance side of an investment house a marketing edge .
Bankers sell potential clients on their analysts ' clout with investors and assure that the analysts will follow their stocks after they go public or do a secondary offering .
In turn , analysts can sometimes leverage their star status to win seven-figure compensation packages from investment houses .
Perhaps , it 's only a matter of time before the free-agency era of financial analysts is stifled by a salary cap .
