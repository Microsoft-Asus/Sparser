-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Battered by Asia 's recession , South Korean exports suffered their largest monthly contraction in 13 1/2 years in July , the government said Monday .
And with imports of raw materials for its factories falling , the nation recorded a dlrs 3.08 billion trade surplus , compared to a dlrs 837 million deficit in the same month last year .
Exports dropped by 13.7 percent to dlrs 10.2 billion from the same month last year , the third straight and the largest monthly contraction since January , 1985 .
The Commerce , Industry and Energy Ministry attributed the contraction to the recession in Asia , one of South Korea 's main export markets , and the appreciation of Korea 's currency , which made its products more expensive .
South Korea hoped a 50 percent depreciation of its currency late last year would help it boost exports , but that hope was shattered by the won 's recent appreciation and the Japanese yen 's weakness .
Japan and South Korea compete in key export items such as automobiles , ships and home appliances , and the weaker yen makes Japanese products more competitive .
Continuing strikes at the nation 's major auto and other manufacturing plants also helped pull down the export figure , the ministry said .
The nation 's imports decreased by 43.7 percent to dlrs 7.12 billion , largely due to sharp drops in international oil prices and in domestic consumption amid the worst financial crisis in years , it said .
The cumulative trade surplus during the first seven months reached dlrs 23.13 billion , compared to a deficit of dlrs 9.99 billion during the same period last year .
