BELFAST , Northern Ireland
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Hume and David Trimble , joint winners of this year 's Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX> , have traveled dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern Ireland accord .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">For Hume , 61 , the single-minded peacemaker who leads the province 's major Catholic party</ENAMEX> , Friday 's honor from the Norwegian Nobel Committee caps a remarkable career that culminated in an agreement he envisioned decades ago .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">For Trimble , 54 , embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal to the peacemaking efforts</ENAMEX> , the Nobel was unexpected and more controversial -- particularly considering the omission of his nemesis , Gerry Adams , leader of the IRA -allied Sinn Fein party .
The Oslo Nobel judges previously have used their award to encourage progress in peacemaking -- most notably in the Middle East , where Israel 's Menachim Begin and Egypt 's Anwar Sadat shared honors in 1978 , and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat joined Israel 's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1994 .
It also has gone to Northern Ireland before -- in 1976 , early in the British province 's three decades of strife , it was won by two women who founded a peace group .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Although Hume and Trimble are not friends and their relations are cool</ENAMEX> , their work culminated in an agreement ratified by voters this spring that sets up a new Protestant - Catholic power-sharing governing structure .
Friday 's citation -- accompanied by dlrs 963,000 , which will be divided equally between the two men -- credited them for work toward ending `` the national , religious and social conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Of Trimble , head of the Ulster Unionist Party , the citation said he showed `` great political courage when , at a critical stage in the process , he advocated solutions which led to the peace agreement . ''</ENAMEX>
That included remaining in negotiations when Sinn Fein gained admission following the Irish Republican Army 's 1997 cease-fire , and agreeing to a deal that would free more than 200 IRA prisoners without a cast-iron guarantee that the IRA would start disarming .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Of Hume , leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party , the citation said he had `` throughout been the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland 's political leaders in his work for a peaceful solution . ''</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume rose to prominence as a 1960s leader of non-violent Catholic protests for equal rights in what was then a Protestant -ruled state .
From 1970 onwards , he did more than anyone else to minimize Catholic support for IRA violence , which he argued only compounded social divisions .
Most critically , he weathered huge personal criticism in 1993 by seeking common ground with Adams , a groundbreaking initiative that encouraged the IRA 's cease-fires and made Hume -- not Adams -- Northern Ireland 's most likely Nobel laureate .</ENAMEX>
In Washington , U.S. President Bill Clinton saluted Trimble 's `` rare courage , '' but emphasized that other figures `` deserve credit for their indispensable roles , beginning with Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein leader without whom there would have been no peace . ''
Clinton also praised former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell , who chaired the peace talks .
While the Nobel committee noted that April 's peace agreement also was the work of the governments of the United Kingdom , Ireland and the United States , it did not include any reference to Mitchell .
The Nobel recognized Trimble 's risky struggle -- successful so far -- to keep a slim majority of the north 's British Protestants supporting a peace process that he himself frequently criticized as offering too many concessions to Sinn Fein and the IRA .
`` I hope very much that this award does n't turn out to be premature , '' Trimble cautioned in the Colorado capital of Denver , his latest stop in a week-long push to attract more North American investment to Northern Ireland .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">As a young Ulster Unionist , Trimble helped topple the party 's leaders when they tried to govern in coalition with Hume 's party in 1973 .</ENAMEX>
Today , he must overcome that same reluctance among Protestants to share power -- not only with Hume but also Sinn Fein , which until recently denied Northern Ireland 's very right to exist .
Speaking in Belfast , Hume said Friday 's honor represented `` very powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern Ireland . ''
`` I think that today 's announcement from the Nobel committee strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the people what the world wants to see on our streets , '' he said .
In New York , Adams -- embroiled in a dangerous showdown with Trimble over how the peace agreement should proceed -- said he was not disappointed about his lack of recognition , and voiced pleasure at Hume 's recognition .
`` I suppose , you know , the big prize is the peace settlement , and that 's the prize for us all to keep our eye on , '' Adams said .
`` The Nobel Peace Prize is only important insofar as it aids the road and the quest for that bigger prize . ''
Asked if the committee has shunned Adams because of the IRA 's terrorist history , Francis Sejersted , the Nobel chairman , refused to discuss the deliberations .
`` I can only repeat that many people have contributed to this process , not in the least Gerry Adams , '' he said .
Sejersted said the committee knew that setbacks and renewed violence still are possible in Northern Ireland , but said the peace agreement `` indicates that the process is going in on the right track .
We wanted to give it a push . ''
The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named this year .
The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen , an Indian scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and other catastrophes .
On Tuesday , Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University , Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than particles .
The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions .
On Monday , the medicine prize was given to three Americans -- Robert Furchgott , Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad -- for their work on discovering properties of nitric oxide , a common air pollutant but also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels .
The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago .
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10 , the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel , the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes in his will .
