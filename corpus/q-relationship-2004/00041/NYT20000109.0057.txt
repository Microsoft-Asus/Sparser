As law enforcement pressure on them intensified after the cardinal 's killing , the Arellanos lavished part of their windfall on a network of lawyers , officials and others who paid bribes and managed business beyond the brothers ' underworld .
According to one intelligence report , corrupt police agents provided them with a steady flow of stolen vehicles , while allies in the Mexican military arranged for their purchase of hundreds of AK -47 assault rifles and even M -50 machine guns .
Of every 10 Tijuana judges , one senior Mexican official who has worked in the region said , `` 11 of them are on the Arellanos ' payroll . ''
Through intermediaries , the brothers offered campaign contributions to up-and-coming politicians and loans to struggling business people .
They expanded their contacts in government offices , hotels and airports , newspapers and television stations .
Though American drug-intelligence analysts know little about their finances -- including the real extent of their wealth -- they believe the Arellanos began laundering profits into offshore accounts , real estate and other investments .
Mexican and American officials said the brothers also grew more sophisticated about communications and counterintelligence .
From safe houses set up with electronic surveillance equipment , they wiretapped the telephones of police and military officials and even some of their own associates .
By stealing or `` cloning '' digital cellular telephones in both Mexico and the United States , they are able to change their numbers on almost a daily basis .
Most important , officials said , the Arellanos solidified their network of protection with bribes , threats and killings on a scale that Mexico had not seen before .
After four years of frustration , U.S. and Mexican officials resolved in 1997 to redouble their efforts in Tijuana , collaborating more closely than ever before .
To many officials it seemed inevitable that the brothers ' luck would run out .
Over the previous year , the slayings of half a dozen senior police officials and prosecutors had been attributed to the gang .
One former prosecutor was killed on his doorstep .
The federal police commander for Tijuana was ambushed in Mexico City .
The head of a special state investigations unit was shot to death in his driveway ; the killers then repeatedly ran over him with their van .
That fall the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted list included its first Mexican drug trafficker , Ramon Arellano , 34 , the brother who is thought to run the gang 's security forces .
Washington ultimately detailed more than 100 agents , analysts and prosecutors to the case , and American officials sought to take advantage of what they saw as new resolve in Mexico City .
`` We are signaling a new , international effort to target this very powerful drug cartel , '' the FBI director , Louis J. Freeh , said at the time .
In San Diego , American officials began meeting regularly with leaders of two new Mexican antidrug squads : a police organized crime unit trained by the enforcement agency and the FBI , and a Mexican army intelligence unit trained by central intelligence .
A third Mexican force -- a small police intelligence team that had also been selected and trained with American help -- was to work with a few American agents stationed in Tijuana .
Should the police teams ever locate the Arellanos , they could turn for support to new airborne units of the Mexican army that were trained for drug raids by the Pentagon .
Initially American officials were thrilled with their progress .
First , a Mexican army general who had taken over as the federal attorney general 's representative in Tijuana stunned the Americans by turning in another general who had come to him on the Arellanos ' behalf offering bribes of $ 1 million a month .
Then , tipped off by yet another Mexican general , Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , American agents arrested two of the gang 's young gunmen at a condominium on San Diego 's tony Coronado Island .
Next , in December 1997 , Mexican police officials arrested one of the Arellanos ' better-known lieutenants and agreed to try to extradite him for trial in the United States .
A new Mexican attorney general , Jorge Madrazo Cuellar , let American agents and prosecutors comb Mexican files on dozens of killings attributed to the Arellanos so that they might develop witnesses for their own cases in San Diego .
The chief of the new organized crime force , Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz , went further , quietly assigning three of his own agents to work directly with the Americans in San Diego .
Later , over the objections of other Mexican officials , Gonzalez even arranged the secret transfer of two Mexican convicts to American prisons so they could testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence against the Arellano gang .
`` Nothing like it had ever happened before , '' an American drug enforcement official recalled .
`` Of course we were encouraged . ''
For all the new policies and programs , however , the two governments made scant progress toward their goal of arresting the brothers and their main associates .
The army general who had famously refused the traffickers ' bribes later shocked American officials by announcing publicly -- and without any apparent proof -- that the Arellanos had abandoned Tijuana and might be out of business .
Gen. Gutierrez Rebollo , whose pressure on the brothers had helped him gain appointment as Mexico 's drug enforcement chief , was found to be working secretly with their main rival .
The promised extradition of the Arellano lieutenant quickly got bogged down in Mexican courts .
In San Diego , drug enforcement and FBI officials grew so suspicious of a Mexican federal police commander in Tijuana that they cut him out of sensitive meetings altogether , several officials said .
Eventually they began holding early-morning strategy sessions with Gonzalez Ruiz , the trusted anticrime chief , and then having him sneak out the back door of their offices so he could come back in the front for meetings to which the less trustworthy officials were also invited .
But even Gonzalez , a former academic with little police experience , was distressingly straightforward about his limitations .
At one meeting described by several American officials , he urged them not to press for the arrest of the Arellanos ' chief lieutenant , Ismael Higuera , arguing that the trafficker was simply too well protected .
A senior Mexican justice official would not comment on the meeting .
By mid-1998 , officials said , Gonzalez and other senior Mexican officials had effectively abandoned Tijuana for what appeared to be a more fruitful investigation of traffickers working out of the southern resort of Cancun .
The Arellanos , however , did not wait for the Mexican authorities to retreat .
