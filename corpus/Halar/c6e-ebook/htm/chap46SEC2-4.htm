In some cases, uncharacteristic sexual behavior is eliminated by natural selection in a direct manner; for example, female spiders will eat males if specific reproductive signals are not followed during mating. (We will discuss other examples of mating behavior in Chapter 51.) Internal fertilization also requires sophisticated reproductive systems, including copulatory organs that deliver sperm and receptacles for its storage and transport to ripe eggs.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Because external fertilization requires an environment where an egg can develop without desiccation or heat stress, it occurs almost exclusively in moist habitats. Many aquatic invertebrates simply shed their eggs and sperm into the surroundings, and fertilization occurs without the parents actually making physical contact. Timing is still crucial to ensure that mature sperm encounter ripe eggs.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Many fishes and amphibians that use external fertilization exhibit specific mating behaviors, in which one male fertilizes the eggs of one female. Courtship behavior is a mutual trigger for the release of gametes, with two effects: The probability of successful fertilization is increased, and the choice of mates may be somewhat selective. Environmental cues such as temperature or day length may cause all the individuals of a population to release gametes at once, or chemical signals from one individual releasing gametes may trigger gamete release in others.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Pheromones</span> are chemical signals released by one organism that influence the behavior of other individuals of the same species. Pheromones are small, volatile or water-soluble molecules that disperse easily into the environment and, like hormones, are active in minute amounts. Many pheromones function as mate attractants. The mate attractants of some female insects can be detected by males as much as a mile away. The pheromone of the female gypsy moth elicits behavioral responses in males at concentrations as low as 1 molecule of pheromone in 10<SUP>17</SUP> molecules of other gases in the air. (We will return to pheromones in Chapter 51.)</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
