WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Almost from the moment TWA Flight 800 plunged into the ocean off Long Island in July 1996 , conspiracy theorists argued that the FBI did not do enough to prove that a bomb or missile downed the Boeing 747 .
On Monday , the bureau came under fire for what some said was a single-minded pursuit of that terrorist theory , even as evidence mounted that mechanical failure was to blame .</ENAMEX>
`` FBI leadership , in the case of TWA Flight 800 , was a disaster , '' Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , said at the opening of his Senate subcommittee hearing on the crash investigation .
`` In fact , it 's fair to say that the FBI hindered the investigation and ... in my view , the FBI risked public safety . ''
The hearing relied heavily on a 24-page report from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms that concluded just six months after Flight 800 went down that mechanical failure was to blame .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The FBI was accused Monday of trying to suppress that report in what critics said was a heavy-handed and sometimes bumbling rush to prove that a bomb or a missile downed the plane .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Investigators eventually determined a mechanical malfunction caused the plane 's center fuel tanks to explode , killing all 230 people on board .</ENAMEX>
A former scientific investigator with the FBI who worked on the Flight 800 case described how James Kallstrom , then-director of the FBI 's New York bureau , became enraged when the investigator disputed the bomb theory .
`` He got about six inches from my face and proceeded to advise me in very graphic terms that it was a bomb , '' said William Tobin , who was later taken off the TWA 800 case by Kallstrom .
`` I ended up wearing several particles of his saliva from that presentation . ''
Kallstrom , who did not testify Monday and has since left the FBI , denied he had suppressed the report but said he did not want it released prematurely .
`` We did n't even have all the pieces off the ocean floor yet , we had n't even built the reconstruction -LRB- of the plane -RRB- , '' Kallstrom said .
`` It is not that we were holding out for a bomb or missile .
We were holding out for a thorough comprehensive investigation . ''
Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and the ATF maintained that the FBI took over the investigation and was sloppy in collecting evidence .
Only FBI agents were allowed to develop pictures of the plane and evidence was allowed to disappear from the hangar where the plane was being reconstructed , the officials said .
Some seat covers from the plane were found in a trash bin and one NTSB official said he walked in to find an FBI agent pounding one piece of evidence with a hammer .
They said the NTSB was , by statute , the lead agency on the crash but the probe became an adversarial turf war , something Grassley hopes to change by clarifying language to make the roles of the agencies clearer .
ATF officials also said once they had concluded that mechanical failure downed the plane , they pushed to circulate their report out of fear that other planes might meet a similar fate .
But the FBI stonewalled , they said .
ATF officials were brought in as experts in explosives .
Grassley presented various hand-scribbled notes from ATF and NTSB officials that he said showed frustration with the FBI .
`` Kallstrom upset with report .
Locks him into eliminating missile .
Refuses to see report , '' read one March 12 , 1997 , note from Anthony Vita , the ATF 's assistant director of field operations .
Lewis Schiliro , the FBI 's assistant director in the New York office , testified Monday that claims the FBI had sat on the ATF report were wrong .
He said the crash came at a politically volatile time -- Ramzi Yousef was on trial in New York City for conspiring to blow up 12 U.S. airliners .
That , combined with eyewitness descriptions seemingly consistent with a missile firing , made a terrorist attack more than a possibility , he said .
`` Can you imagine , Mr. Chairman , if we had not pushed to look at every possibility , no matter how remote ? ''
Schiliro asked Grassley .
`` I and all of the law enforcement people who worked on this would not have been doing our jobs and would have been rightly subject to harsh criticism . ''
