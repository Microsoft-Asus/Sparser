OMSK , Russia --
It is three hours by air from Moscow to Omsk , a sprawling collection of fraying low-rises set on a Kansas -flat plain by the oil fields of Siberia .
Every month or two , a well-dressed , bespectacled young man arrives by commercial jet here and is whisked away to a corporate apartment not far from the Omsk Oil Refinery , Russia 's largest and most modern petroleum complex .
After a day or two of unspecified business , he leaves as he came .
Virtually nobody in this city of 1.2 million people would notice , but for his name : Leonid Dyachenko , the husband of President Boris Yeltsin 's daughter and right-hand strategist , Tatyana Dyachenko .
Once so anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his first name , the 36-year -old Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful life .
He popped into the headlines two weeks ago when it turned out that he had a bank account in the Cayman Islands with more than $ 2 million .
His bank is the Bank of New York , which is at the center of a criminal investigation in the United States of possible money laundering .
Dyachenko is an oil trader .
But he is more than that .
He is a participant -- if not a key figure -- in a network of politically blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to Eastern Europe .
His work is all the more colorful because , for many oil traders , oil is almost an afterthought .
Virtually all of Russia 's oil giants use creative financial transactions to ship billions of dollars offshore , too -- beyond the reach of tax collectors and , for that matter , company shareholders .
Of most interest to investigators tracing the billions of dollars that have flowed out of Russia this decade are Dyachenko 's bank accounts , which apparently got most of their money from his dealings with oil companies , according to statements by bank officials .
The officials of those companies , and Dyachenko 's benefactors , include two Russian tycoons who are among Yeltsin 's strongest supporters , Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich , as well as the son of the autocratic pro- Yeltsin governor of the Omsk region .
Dyachenko 's operations stretch from Omsk to Moscow to Manhattan , where he is allied with a frenetic Russian capitalist named Viktor Khrolenko and , records indicate , seems to have occupied a luxury apartment overlooking New York 's financial district .
Khrolenko , who set up two oil trading firms that employed Dyachenko and befriended the Yeltsin family , said in an interview that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized his records and that he was recently summoned to appear next Thursday before a federal grand jury looking into Russian financial dealings in the United States .
Through a lawyer , he denied any wrongdoing .
The Kremlin has refused in the past to discuss Dyachenko .
And nothing so far links Dyachenko to any of the now-infamous companies , like the Benex International Co. , that have been indicted on charges of illegally moving nearly $ 7 billion from Russia through Bank of New York accounts over the last 3 1/2 years .
Still , Dyachenko 's business in Omsk and Manhattan raises questions throughout Moscow about his lucrative relationships with business tycoons who have profited from the personal intervention of Dyachenko 's father-in-law , Yeltsin .
Less clear is the true role of Khrolenko , an engaging but curious wheeler-dealer who seems to have played midwife on both sides of the ocean to Dyachenko 's oil career .
Tall , good-looking and energetic , Khrolenko was a Russian capitalist before Russian capitalism was cool , much less before it overheated .
`` Viktor was one of those guys who asked me to smuggle him a copy of Samuelson 's book on economics in ` 78 or ` 79 , '' said Jonathan Sanders , a Columbia University professor who is a godfather to one of Khrolenko 's grandchildren .
`` He 's a real Russian patriot who just wanted to bring some American things into his country . ''
By the time Communism collapsed , Khrolenko had hooked up with a onetime promoter for the Rolling Stones to secure a CBS recording contract for a Russian rock band and bring Soviet newscasts to the Discovery Channel .
He started , then sold , an American -style nightclub , Manhattan Express , in a staid hotel near Red Square , and published books on Russian art and literature .
His corporate umbrella , Belka International , had annual sales of more than than $ 100 million in 1992 , according to a Moscow business newspaper .
A more recent report , by Dun & Bradstreet , places recent sales at close to $ 30 million .
Sanders believes Khrolenko had met Yeltsin by the late 1980s , when Yeltsin was gaining the image of a Communist reformer .
And Khrolenko suggested that he met Yeltsin 's son-in-law through a timber deal in the early 1990s .
What is clear is that in 1993 , the Kremlin called Andrew Nurnberg , Yeltsin 's literary agent in London , and said Khrolenko would negotiate the American rights to Yeltsin 's autobiography .
`` I heard he was desperate to be seen with Yeltsin , '' Nurnberg said in a telephone interview .
`` That was in those days when you could benefit by being close to the president of Russia . ''
Peter Osnos , then the publisher of Times Books and now the publisher at Public Affairs , said Yeltsin 's book was excellent -- and that the American edition never made a penny .
In an interview , he recalled attending a spectacular Kremlin dinner to celebrate the unveiling of the book at which Khrolenko sat with the presidential family .
`` What happened to him after that , I do n't know , '' he said .
Part of what happened , is that Khrolenko went from publishing to petroleum -- and Russian politics .
By the spring of 1994 , when Yeltsin 's book appeared in the United States , Khrolenko 's Belka was peddling its services at a Washington conference on Russian technology , opened by Vice President Al Gore .
Among others there was the governor of Omsk region , Leonid Polezhayev .
A participant , who refused to be identified for fear of retribution , said Khrolenko was actively promoting oil and gas deals in the area -- and that Polezhayev was at his side .
`` They hugged each other like old friends , '' said that person .
`` I think they 'd known each other for a long time . ''
A huge deal was soon sealed , but it did not directly involve Khrolenko .
Under a government program known as loans for shares , the Kremlin elected to sell off effective control of the Omsk Oil Refinery , the city 's biggest employer , to the highest bidder .
That triggered a bitter battle that ended when the chief opponent of the plan , the refinery 's general director , was found dead in Omsk 's Irtysh River a week before the company 's auction .
The winner of the auction was a huge energy company , Siberian Oil Co. , known as Sibneft .
Its ownership is murky at best , but most analysts say control rests with the company 's general director , Abramovich -LRB- pronounced ah-bra- MO -vich -RRB- and his longtime business ally , Berezovsky , perhaps Russia 's richest and most public business titan .
The Sibneft acquisition appears to have been good news for both Khrolenko and Dyachenko .
Sibneft began selling its refined Siberian oil through a network of oil traders .
At the top of Sibneft 's list were two companies : a Khrolenko creation called Belka Energy of New York , and a second , better-known Russian company called Runikom .
By all accounts , Dyachenko has either overseen or played a leading role in Belka 's dealings with the Omsk refinery .
A vice president of Runikom , which itself holds a 10 percent share of Sibneft , is none other than the son of the governor of Omsk , Alexsei Polezhayev .
The incestuous nature of the ties is clear from the location of Belka 's Moscow office : in the refurbished building that houses representatives of the Omsk regional government .
As a practical matter , Sibneft seems to have awarded the relatives of Yeltsin and a key supporter lucrative contracts to distribute its petroleum products .
Just how lucrative is not clear ; Sibneft , one of the world 's biggest oil firms , still does not have to disclose its internal business dealings .
Khrolenko 's lawyer , Irwin Rochman , said in a lengthy interview that Khrolenko 's companies are legitimate and that Dyachenko , who has an undisclosed `` relationship '' with the companies , `` has been compensated handsomely '' for his work .
But it is unclear what Dyachenko does .
According to an account by one petroleum expert in Omsk , which is impossible to verify , Belka and a second Khrolenko company run by Dyachenko , East Coast Petroleum , move about 10,000 tons of diesel fuel from Omsk each month .
Most goes to former Soviet satellites like Hungary and Croatia ; increasingly , some goes to Ukraine .
`` It 's crumbs , mere crumbs , '' that expert said .
Like many experts , he characterized the allotment as a political favor , much as a powerful American company might suddenly choose to hire the unexceptional son of a congressman or governor .
But to most people , the sums involved -- and the profits -- can be immense .
The vast majority of Russian oil giants effectively launder their oil through a network of offshore companies -- some wholly owned subsidiaries , others controlled by favored friends -- to avoid taxes .
The Russian government slaps a 20 percent value-added tax on every ton of exported oil or gas .
In the simplest scheme , an oil company agrees to sell its crude to a foreign trader for slightly below the market price , thereby understating its profit and paying less tax .
The trader then resells the oil at market prices and agrees to split the profit with his supplier .
Most important , the unreported profit stays offshore .
`` If you have an offshore entity , you can declare less income and pay less taxes -- excise , profit , corporate or income tax , '' said an executive of one major Western company .
The rake-off goes largely to feed official corruption , lining the pockets of politicians and company officials .
In particular , both Russian and foreign oil executives say , the government 's energy and fuel ministry -- which controls oil exports -- is almost brazenly corrupt .
Even officially , the government does little to conceal the practice .
In 1997 , a banner year for oil exports , nearly half of the 97 million tons of crude oil exports were sent -- on paper , at least -- to tax havens like Gibraltar , Lichtenstein and the Bahamas , many without refineries .
A review of Russian customs records by a Russian petroleum newsletter turned up no evidence that either Belka or East Coast Petroleum had received oil exports in the last two years .
That could be literally true .
But experts say it is possible that the two companies could be placed further offshore in a chain of transactions beyond the reach of Russian tax collectors .
In Omsk , where at least some of the records exist , even those in the know do not want to talk about it .
Journalists who have challenged Polezhayev 's rule have found themselves under investigation .
In one interview this week , a subject removed the batteries from a mobile telephone , explaining calmly that this would prevent security police from monitoring the interview .
The governor 's office declined a reporter 's request to discuss these and other issues .
`` The less you know , '' said one man who declined to delve deeply into Belka 's history , `` the longer you live . ''
