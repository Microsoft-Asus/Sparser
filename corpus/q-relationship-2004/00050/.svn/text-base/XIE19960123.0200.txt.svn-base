BOGOTA , January 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- President Ernesto Samper knew that the Cali drug cartel contributed funds to his 1994 election campaign , his jailed campaign director said today .
Fernando Botero , Samper 's former campaign chief and defense minister , told a local television news program that Samper knew all about the illicit money alleged to have supported his campaign .
`` Samper is seriously involved in the Cali cartel money that entered his campaign , '' Botero was quoted as saying .
Samper has denied the charges repeatedly and said that if any drug money was used in his campaign , it was done `` behind my back . ''
In December , a congressional commission dropped an investigation of Samper and his campaign , citing lack of evidence .
Botero , a close friend of Samper , was jailed in August on suspicion that he accepted campaign contributions from Cali drug traffickers .
Reports say Botero broke his silence because he was angry with Samper for making him the scandal scapegoat .
Samper , a Liberal who was seriously wounded by drug cartel gunmen in 1989 , defeated Conservative rival Andres Pastrana in June 1994 in one of Colombia 's tightest presidential races .
