Heat is absorbed when hydrogen bonds break and is released when hydrogen bonds form, helping minimize temperature fluctuations to within limits that permit life. Evaporative cooling is based on water’s high heat of vaporization. Water molecules must have a relatively high kinetic energy to break hydrogen bonds. The evaporative loss of these energetic water molecules cools a surface.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Oceans and lakes don’t freeze solid because ice floats (pp. 44-45,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.6</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Ice is less dense than liquid water because its more organized hydrogen bonding causes expansion into a crystal formation. Floating ice allows life to exist under the frozen surfaces of lakes and polar seas.</p></LI><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Water is the solvent of life (pp. 45-47,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.7</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Water is an unusually versatile solvent because its polar molecules are attracted to charged and polar substances. When ions or polar substances are surrounded by water molecules, they dissolve and are called solutes. Hydrophilic substances have an affinity for water. Hydrophobic substances do not; they seem to repel water. Biologists usually use molarity, the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, as a measure of solute concentration in solutions. A mole is the number of grams of a substance equal to its molecular weight.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">The Dissociation of Water Molecules</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Organisms are sensitive to changes in pH (pp. 47-49,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.9</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Water can dissociate into H<SUP>+</SUP> and OH<SUP>-</SUP>. The concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP> is expressed as pH, where pH = -log [H<SUP>+</SUP>]. Acids donate additional H<SUP>+</SUP> in aqueous solutions; bases donate OH<SUP>-</SUP> or accept H<SUP>+</SUP>. In a neutral solution, [H<SUP>+</SUP>] = [OH<SUP>-</SUP>] = 10<SUP>-7</SUP>, and pH = 7. In an acidic solution, [H<SUP>+</SUP>] is greater than [OH<SUP>-</SUP>], and the pH is less than 7. In a basic solution, [H<SUP>+</SUP>] is less than [OH<SUP>-</SUP>], and the pH is greater than 7. Buffers in biological fluids resist changes in pH. A buffer consists of an acid-base pair that combines reversibly with hydrogen ions.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity3C:</span><span class="Emphasis1"><span class="Emphasis2">
