THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GENES AND PROTEINS

 

 The study of metabolic defects provided evidence that genes specify proteins



 

 Transcription and translation are the two main processes linking gene to protein: an overview



 

 In the genetic code, nucleotide triplets specify amino acids



 

 The genetic code must have evolved very early in the history of life



Researchers are now working out the structures and processes of protein synthesis in amazing detail. See, for example, the computer graphic on this page, which shows a ribosome at the molecular level. The exploded view at the right also shows three transfer RNA molecules, in red, orange, and yellow. As you will learn in this chapter, these molecules cooperate with the ribosome in polypeptide synthesis. But before going into the details of how genes direct protein synthesis, let's step back and examine how the fundamental relationship between genes and proteins was discovered.
