Three days a week , The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a question on the issues .
Today 's question and the responses : Cuba : What conditions would Cuba have to meet for you to favor dropping the embargo ?
Democrats : Bill Bradley : `` We should end the embargo when there is a government in Cuba that allows democratic participation in the political process , grants economic freedom , and ends its absolute control over civic institutions , religious practice and expression of opinion .
I look forward to the day that is possible . ''
Al Gore : `` My policy is clear : We will not normalize relations with Cuba until it is democratic .
I support the people of Cuba and their desire to be free of the oppressive Castro dictatorship .
As President , I will maintain pressure on the Cuban Government while supporting the Cuban people to forge a multinational effort to press for democratic change in Cuba . ''
Reform : Pat Buchanan : `` I would isolate and ostracize Fidel Castro as long as he is in power .
But I would try to aid the Cuban people who are our friends , whose freedom Castro denies , and whose lives could be improved by access to U.S. food , medicine , and civilian goods . ''
Republicans : Gary Bauer : `` Fidel Castro should resign and his successors should schedule free and internationally supervised elections .
When that process is complete , all sanctions can be removed . ''
George W. Bush : `` I believe there should be no changes in United States policy toward Cuba until three conditions are met : free elections , free speech , and freedom for political prisoners . ''
Steve Forbes : `` Until Castro falls and the people of Cuba hold free and fair elections , we should not lift the trade embargo .
We should do nothing that could prop up and strengthen Castro 's evil , oppressive regime .
The Castro regime is the only beneficiary of economic and political activities in the island .
If lifting the embargo would help promote economic development and popular dissatisfaction against the current regime , why has n't it happened with European and Canadian investments ?
Simply because the people of Cuba do not currently benefit from international economic activity .
Only the Castro regime does .
This helps strengthen their oppressive grip on the good people of Cuba . ''
Orrin Hatch : `` I would support the incremental easing of the embargo if there were demonstrable progress toward internal reforms in Cuba . ''
Alan Keyes : No response .
John McCain : `` Cuban foreign policy has been unremittingly hostile to United States interests since the revolution in 1959 .
Combined with continuing human rights problems there , the groundwork has not been established for the lifting of sanctions .
Cuban dictator Fidel Castro remains adamantly opposed to political liberalization , and his posture toward the U.S. remains as hostile today as it was 40 years ago .
In order for sanctions against Cuba to be lifted , the Cuban government would have to make demonstrable steps toward democratization and free market reforms ; vastly improve its human rights record ; and cease its policy of seeking to undermine U.S. interests abroad . ''
