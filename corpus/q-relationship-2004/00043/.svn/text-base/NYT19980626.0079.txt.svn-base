Jasper slaying suspect 's tattoos point to prison gang By Mike Ward Cox News Service AUSTIN , Texas -- One of the three ex-convicts suspected of dragging a black man to death behind a pickup earlier this month in Jasper wore a Klan tattoo that pictured a lynching victim , a Senate committee was told .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The disclosure , providing the first detail of what investigators earlier had characterized only as tattoos `` consistent with the practices of white supremacy , '' came during a recent hearing into the growing criminal influence of prison gangs across Texas</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">State Sen. Royce West , chairman of the legislative inquiry , quizzed Sammy Buentello , the prison system 's chief gang investigator , about ties between the three suspects in the Jasper slaying and white-supremacist prison gangs that promote racial hatred inside Texas ' corrections system</ENAMEX> .
`` Did one have a tattoo of an African - American man hanging from a tree ? ''
West asked .
`` Yes sir , '' Buentello answered , telling West that the suspect did not have the tattoo when he entered the prison system .
Prison officials are unsure if he got it while in prison or after he was paroled .
The tattooed suspect was not identified by name during the hearing .
And few other details were made public .
But according to others familiar with the case , the tattoo is a very small part of a mural that covers one suspect 's arm .
In the image are a duck dressed as a Ku Klux Klansman , with his hood in one hand , and a silhouetted figure hanging from a branch of a tree to one side of the duck .
The suspect also has an `` Aryan Pride '' tatoo , featuring an eagle and a Confederate flag , on one of his sides and a shield with the words `` Death before Dishonor '' and `` C.K.A . ''
on another spot .
Authorities believe those initials stand for Confederate Knights of America , a small white-supremacist group in Texas prisons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Two of the three suspects in the Jasper killing were suspected of associating with prison gang members but were not thought to be members , authorities said</ENAMEX> .
During the hearing , Buentello and a string of other law enforcement officials repeatedly sounded the same warning : <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Prison gangs are growing more violent and more criminal , both inside and outside of Texas prisons</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In addition to the approximately 5,000 confirmed members of 10 gangs , Buentello estimated there are up to 6,000 more convicts who are affiliated with street gang groups that are more loosely organized -- but no less violent</ENAMEX> .
Proof : a graphic videotape from the Eastham prison unit in 1984 , showing one gang member repeatedly stabbing another as gang comrades held a prison door shut to keep guards from intervening .
Showing photos of bloody , battered bodies of gang-killed convicts at other prisons , Buentello told senators : `` When prison gangs kill people , they want to send a message '' about what happens when someone disobeys the gang .
A former member of the Texas Syndicate prison gang , who asked that his name not be publicized , told the committee how gang members communicate in coded messages and letters -- mailed between prison units or sent verbally with female visitors known as `` thoroughbreds , '' because they run the information .
Steve Robinson , executive director of the Texas Youth Commission , warned that prison gang activity is spreading from adult units into the juvenile-corrections system .
Prison and Department of Public Safety officials recommended that a statewide database on gangs be established , to allow police and prison and parole officials to track members and activities .
`` It is a war , it truly is , '' Robinson said .
`` They are not playing by anybody 's rules except their own -- and none of ours . ''
