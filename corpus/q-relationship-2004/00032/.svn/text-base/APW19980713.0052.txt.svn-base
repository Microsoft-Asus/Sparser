BANGKOK , Thailand
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A Thai monk has threatened to put a curse on government officials who intend to destroy a controversial Buddha statue at his temple .
`` I really want to know who will dare to demolish this statue , '' Phra Khru Sopitsutakhun , the monk , was quoted as saying in Monday 's The Nation newspaper .
`` Anyone who dares to do that may meet an indescribable curse . ''
Thai government officials and high-ranking members of the Buddhist clergy have condemned the statue at the temple in Chachoengsao province , 30 kilometers -LRB- 19 miles -RRB- east of Bangkok , as sacrilegious and offensive , and have said they will pull it down .
The 10-meter -LRB- 33-foot -RRB- statue portrays the Buddha standing with his right foot on top of a globe of the world .
`` Posing with one foot on the globe is like sneering at the world , '' Education Minister Chumpol Silapa -archa was quoted as saying in local media on Sunday .
`` There is no such thing in either Buddha 's teachings or our tradition . ''
The Education Ministry oversees the Buddhist clergy , which only permits the Buddha to be depicted in certain poses that carry specific symbolic meanings .
The monk , however , said his statue conformed to Buddha 's teachings , showing how he rose from earth to a higher plane of enlightenment .
He said the pose showed Buddha protecting the world .
He offered to compromise with the government by covering the statue with a cloth and charging anyone who wants to see it unveiled 100 baht -LRB- dlrs 2.50 -RRB-
