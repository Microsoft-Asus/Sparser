JERUSALEM
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- With three weeks to go and not even a draft agreement in sight , Palestinian and Israeli negotiators announced plans Monday for marathon negotiations aimed at meeting a Feb. 13 deadline on the outline of a final status agreement .
Prime Minister Ehud Barak , limping on the Syrian track , is eager to show results with the Palestinians .
His office said in a release Monday that negotiations would be held on several levels `` with the intent of speeding up the talks . ''
The talks will likely start Feb. 1 , somewhere near Washington , according to Palestinian officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
They will address the sensitive issues of borders , Palestinian refugees , the status of Jerusalem and the future of Jewish settlements .
Despite the renewed effort , Barak 's office said he will most likely not travel to Davos this weekend for a proposed summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton , citing scheduling problems .
Israeli media said Barak is reluctant to hold talks with the two leaders now because he is concerned about being pressured into making concessions .
Even with the renewed efforts , Israeli negotiator Oded Eran said Monday the February deadline would be `` very difficult '' to meet .
Barak , elected in May on a platform of thawing peace talks frozen by his hard-line predecessor , ambitiously set the February deadline for the outline of an agreement .
He predicted permanent peace agreements with the Palestinians and the Syrians by the end of 2000 .
The renewed talks with the Syrians have proven more complex than he realized , however , and have sidetracked him from the Palestinian track .
According to Palestinian officials , Barak 's distractions have meant that there is not even a draft of an outline agreement , three weeks before the deadline .
Talks with the Syrians have all but collapsed over demilitarization and border issues and -- to the Palestinians ' delight -- Barak has returned to the Palestinian track .
His renewed involvement appeared to spur the resolution of disagreements over the implementation of an interim agreement -- a side issue that had nonetheless also dogged the final status talks .
Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after his 3 1/2-hour meeting with Eran on Monday that they had reached an agreement on a delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank .
The withdrawal , which had been scheduled for Jan. 20 , will now take place by Feb. 10 .
The Palestinians want the Israelis to hand over Arab suburbs of Jerusalem , currently under joint control , to full Palestinian control in the next withdrawal .
Israel has resisted , apparently hoping the Palestinians would settle for the suburbs as a substitute for Jerusalem in the final status agreement .
It is precisely because the Palestinians do not want the suburbs to cloud the Jerusalem issue that they want full control now .
`` We have reached an agreement satisfactory to both sides , '' Erekat said when asked about the suburbs as he was leaving the luxury hotel on Jerusalem 's east-west divide , where the meeting took place .
Talk of returning Abu Dis , Azzariya and A - Ram outrages Israeli hard-liners , including Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert , who conjure images of a redivision of Jerusalem , captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war .
`` Abu Dis lies only a few yards away from the Temple Mount , '' Olmert said , referring to a site holy to Muslims and Jews alike .
Handing it over would `` invite an endless political penetration from there into Jerusalem , the purpose of which is to cut off the eastern part of the city . ''
Israelis say they will never relinquish east Jerusalem , while Palestinians want it as a capital to their planned state .
Haim Ramon , the minister in Barak 's Cabinet who handles Jerusalem affairs , said Israel did not intend to hand the suburbs over to full Palestinian control just yet .
But he said Israel would not object to the Palestinians using Abu Dis as a seat of government .
`` They can have their center of control in Abu Dis , '' he told Israel radio .
`` There , they can do everything not against , or not harming the security interests of Israel . ''
