Hoping to curb a dangerous arms race in South Asia , the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to urge India and Pakistan to halt their nuclear weapons programs and to deny them status as nuclear states .
But members also warned the nuclear weapons states -- the United States , Russia , China , France and Britain -- that they have a responsibility to renew efforts to curb nuclear weapons , including those in their own arsenals .
`` The rest of us expect you to seriously take your responsibility of finally removing the threat of nuclear weapons , which , even with the end of the Second World War , continue to hang over our heads , '' Kenyan Ambassador Njunguna Moses Mahugu said .
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that Israel has also refused to sign the 1970 Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty or to accept safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
He said `` Israeli intransigence '' on accepting nuclear controls `` has endangered the entire '' Middle East .
Israel has never admitted having nuclear weapons but is widely assumed to have the necessary technology to build a bomb quickly .
In a letter to Council President Antonio Monteiro , India 's U.N. ambassador , Kamalesh Sharma , said the resolution involved `` sovereign decisions taken by member states , not matters in which the council has any role . ''
Sharma asked whether the Security Council can `` continue to ignore the overwhelming demand '' of the rest of the world `` for elimination of nuclear weapons '' when the most important council members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals .
The resolution , cosponsored by Japan , Costa Rica , Slovenia and Sweden , urged India and Pakistan to halt deployment of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and to sign nuclear arms control treaties .
It also asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and to find `` mutually acceptable solutions '' to the `` root causes of those tensions , including Kashmir . ''
The resolution also stated that although India and Pakistan have exploded nuclear devices , they would not be accorded status as nuclear states .
Under the non-proliferation treaty , the five nuclear powers are the only nations allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals .
India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty .
It also welcomed an offer by U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level dialogue that broke down last year because of differences over Kashmir .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 -- two of them over Kashmir , which is divided between them .
