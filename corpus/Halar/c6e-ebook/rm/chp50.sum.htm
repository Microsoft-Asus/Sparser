Eutrophic lakes are high in nutrients and productivity; oligotrophic lakes are nutrient-poor. Rivers and streams contain freshwater communities that change significantly from the source to the final destination in an ocean or lake. An estuary is the zone where a river or stream enters the ocean; it is marked by fluctuations in salinity.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Oceanic zones include the intertidal zone, the neritic zone, and the oceanic zone. In the tropics, coral reefs are found in the warm, nutrient-rich waters of the neritic zone. The oceanic pelagic biome includes most of the open ocean. Photosynthetic plankton in the photic region of the pelagic zone are the primary food source for the rest of the community. Benthic, or bottom, communities subsist largely on detritus that rains down from the pelagic zone.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity50C:<span class="Emphasis1">

Deserts are inhabited by plants and animals adapted to extremely dry conditions. Chaparral is a dry scrubland found where winters are mild and rainy and summers are hot and dry. Temperate grasslands occur on nutrient-rich, deep soils where periodic fires and drought and the grazing of large mammals inhibit the growth of woody plants. Temperate deciduous forests occur in midlatitudes where there is sufficient moisture to support the growth of large, broadleaf deciduous trees. Coniferous forests include coastal temperate rain forests and the northern coniferous forest, or taiga. The largest terrestrial biome, taiga, is characterized by long, cold, snowy winters and short summers. Arctic tundra occurs at the northernmost limits of plant growth, where cold temperatures, wind, and permafrost limit plants to low shrubby or matlike forms. Alpine tundra occurs at high altitudes.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity50D:<span class="Emphasis1">
