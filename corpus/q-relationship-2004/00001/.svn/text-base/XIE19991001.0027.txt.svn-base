UNITED NATIONS , September 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The best framework to face and address seriously and effectively the challenges and phenomena facing the international community is a United Nations truly respected by all its members , Syria said here on Thursday .
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General Assembly , Syria 's Minister of Foreign Affairs Farouk Al - Ahara said the marginalization of the role of the United Nations , or using it only on occasions , or as a cover for resolutions and initiatives taken outside the Security Council , will not be in the interest of anyone .
On the reform of the United Nations Security Council , the Minister said there has been nothing achieved except the marginalization for the status of the Security Council and bypassing its central role in keeping international peace and security whenever the need arises , and sometimes without any need arising .
`` It seems that the deliberate marginalization of the role of the Security Council and achieving no progress whatsoever in restructuring it has provided the pretext awaited by some to ignore the United Nations Charter and violate the sovereignty of countries through the use of regional military organizations as a substitute for the Security Council , '' he said .
The United Nations should be respected truly , based on joint work in which countries of the South and North participate , each according to their abilities and capacities , the Minister added .
