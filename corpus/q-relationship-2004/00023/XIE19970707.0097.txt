LAGOS , July 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The U. N. Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- has called on all sides in the Sierra Leonean conflict to stop using children as combatants and providing for their physical and emotional welfare in a future peace settlement .
In a recent report , UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said since the country 's May 25 coup , witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of armed children in the streets of Freetown , the capital .
Many are former child soldiers , who had returned to their communities during a country-wide demobilization program which began in 1993 , she said , quoted by local newspaper This Day today .
They have now been recruited and re-armed by the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and their allies .
According to the report , more than 60 percent of 1,000 fighters recently screened by the Disarmament , Remobilization and Resettlement Unit , set up by the ousted government in the coup , were women and children .
The report put Sierra Leone as a country with one of the world 's worst records for recruiting child soldiers .
Between 1992 and 1996 , in the previous period of civil unrest between the government and the rebel Revolutionary United Front , an estimated 4,500 children were forced to fight on both sides , it disclosed .
Children were abducted and forced to commit atrocities in order to turn them into ruthless fighters , Bellamy said , adding that `` child soldiers are a symptom of the wider problem , the complete neglect of a whole generation and every child has felt the impact of this war , whether or not he or she has been forced to carry a gun . ''
Young girls , the report went on , have been raped and sexually abused and many children have been stranded without parents or relatives .
Food distribution has been disrupted and immunization campaigns halted , leaving children susceptible to epidemics of typhoid and cholera , it said .
