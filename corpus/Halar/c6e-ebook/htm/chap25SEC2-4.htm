Indeed, it was biogeography, even more than fossils, that first nudged Darwin and Wallace toward an evolutionary view of life. The history of Earth helps explain the current geographic distribution of species. For example, the emergence of volcanic islands such as the Gal&aacute;pagos opens new environments for founders that reach the outposts, and adaptive radiation fills many of the available niches with new species. On a global scale, the drifting of continents is the major geographic factor correlated with the spatial distribution of life and with such evolutionary episodes as mass extinctions and explosive increases in biological diversity.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The continents are not fixed, but drift about Earth’s surface like passengers on great plates of crust floating on the hot, underlying mantle (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 25.3a</span>). Unless two landmasses are embedded in the same plate, their positions relative to each other change. For example, North America and Europe are presently drifting apart at a rate of about 2 cm per year. Many important geologic processes, including mountain building, volcanism, and earthquakes, occur at plate boundaries (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 25.3b</span>). California’s infamous San Andreas Fault is part of a border where two plates slide past each other.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig25-3','../fig/big/fig25-3.jpg','fig25-3');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig25-3.jpg" alt="fig25-3" name="myfig25-3"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 25-3.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Earth’s crustal plates and plate tectonics (geologic processes resulting from plate movements).</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Plate movements rearrange geography incessantly, but two chapters in the continuing saga of continental drift had an especially strong influence on life. About 250 million years ago, near the end of the Paleozoic era, plate movements brought all the landmasses together into a supercontinent that has been named <span class="Emphasis2">Pangaea,</span> meaning "all land" (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 25.4</span>, p. 490). Imagine some of the possible effects on life. Species that had been evolving in isolation came together and competed. When the landmasses coalesced, the total amount of shoreline was reduced, and there is evidence that the ocean basins increased in depth, which lowered sea level and drained the shallow coastal seas. Then, as now, most marine species inhabited shallow waters, and the formation of Pangaea destroyed a considerable amount of that habitat. It was probably a long, traumatic period for terrestrial life as well. The continental interior, which has a drier and more erratic climate than coastal regions, increased in area substantially when the land came together. Changing ocean currents also would have affected land life as well as sea life. The formation of Pangaea surely had a tremendous environmental impact that reshaped biological diversity by causing extinctions and providing new opportunities for taxonomic groups that survived the crisis.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig25-4','../fig/big/fig25-4.jpg','fig25-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig25-4.jpg" alt="fig25-4" name="myfig25-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 25-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The history of continental drift.</span> About 250 million years ago, all of Earth’s landmasses were locked together in a supercontinent named Pangaea. About 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to split into northern (Laurasia) and southern (Gondwana) landmasses, which later separated into the modern continents. India collided with Eurasia just 10 million years ago, forming the Himalayas, the tallest and youngest of Earth’s major mountain ranges. The continents continue to drift.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The second dramatic chapter in the history of continental drift was written about 180 million years ago, during the Mesozoic era. Pangaea began to break up, causing geographic isolation of colossal proportions. As the continents drifted apart, each became a separate evolutionary arena, and the faunas and floras of the different biogeographic realms diverged.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The pattern of continental mergings and separations is the solution to many biogeographic puzzles. For example, paleontologists have discovered matching fossils of Triassic reptiles in Ghana (West Africa) and Brazil. These two parts of the world, now separated by 3,000 km of ocean, were contiguous during the early Mesozoic era. Continental drift also explains much about the current distribution of organisms, such as why the Australian fauna and flora contrast so sharply with that of the rest of the world. The great diversity of marsupials (pouched mammals), which fill ecological roles in Australia analogous to those filled by eutherian (placental) mammals on other continents, is just one example of Australia’s unique collection of species. Marsupials probably evolved first in what is now North America and reached Australia via South America and Antarctica while the continents were still joined. The subsequent breakup of the southern continents set Australia "afloat" like a great ark of marsupials. On Australia, marsupials evolved and diversified, while eutherian mammals evolved and diversified on other continents. Australia has been isolated for 50 million years. Bats, rats, mice, and humans (and their domesticated animals) are the only eutherian mammals that have managed to populate the island continent.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
