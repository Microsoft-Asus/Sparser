NEW BEDFORD , Mass .
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- They spent the day tethered together by chains shackled around their left ankles , painting an iron fence under the watchful eyes of armed guards .
But the 10 inmates did n't mind the work .
They volunteered for it .
`` I have n't been out for 15 months , '' said a 37-year -old man who asked to be identified as Scott .
`` We just wanted the opportunity to be in the fresh air . ''
Chain gangs , once a symbol of pitiless Southern justice , have come to Massachusetts .
In what is believed to be the state 's first such work crew , the inmates Wednesday painted a fence at a New Bedford drug treatment center .
Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson , who prefers the term `` tandem work crews , '' scoffs at suggestions his crews are more about humiliation than rehabilitation .
`` Chain gangs were meant to break people down .
My program is the complete opposite -- it builds self-esteem and self confidence , and helps them know they 've accomplished something , '' he said .
The prisoners , dressed in red shirts and pants , agreed .
`` I do n't think it 's humiliating at all , '' said Kevin , 39 , serving 2 1/2 years on a probation violation related to drunken-driving convictions .
`` It 's more humiliating to sit behind the prison walls every day . ''
Chain gangs , largely black crews , broke rocks and built roads in the South in the late 19th century .
By 1970 , they had vanished in much of the country with the advent of civil rights and prison reform movements .
In the 1990s , chain gangs began to resurface , first in Alabama , followed by Arizona , Florida and Iowa .
Maricopa County , Ariz. , started one for women , too .
Officials insist today 's chain gangs are far from the shackled crews that gained infamy in song -LRB- Sam Cooke 's `` Chain Gang '' -RRB- and film -LRB- `` Cool Hand Luke '' -RRB- .
`` It seems to be working quite well , '' said Gary McClelland , a prison supervisor in Wisconsin , where chain gangs went to work in 1997 .
`` They work on community projects and it 's been very well-received . ''
The program in Bristol County involves prisoners convicted of nonviolent crimes .
Then why , critics ask , the chains and armed guards ?
`` These are n't hardened criminals , '' said Joshua Rubenstein , northeast regional director for Amnesty International USA .
`` The chain gang is a form of gratuitous humiliation . ''
A group of black state lawmakers said they will file legislation to ban the practice .
And officials from at least two Massachusetts towns -- Fairhaven and Westport -- have declined to participate .
`` I think it goes back to pre-civil rights days , '' said Winfred Eckenreiter , a Fairhaven selectman and former prosecutor .
`` Most of us are happy we 've gotten past that . ''
