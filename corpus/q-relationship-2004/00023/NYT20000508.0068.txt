WASHINGTON --
Political strategies come and go , but this one endures : never underestimate the political potency of motherhood .
The leaders of the Million Mom March for `` common sense gun control '' next Sunday , Mother 's Day , have a warm and fuzzy Web site -LRB- www.millionmommarch.com -RRB- , a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grassroots organizing campaign .
But above all , they are invoking a very old tradition in politics : trying to break through ideology and partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of women as mothers .
It worked for Mothers Against Drunk Driving , widely credited with helping to create a fundamental shift in society 's attitudes toward drinking and driving .
It worked for many of the women 's clubs in the early part of this century , which historians say played a key role in passing much of the early social welfare legislation , like mothers ' pensions and child and maternal health programs .
It has been used in peace movements , here and in such places as Northern Ireland , in and anti-abortion marches , in environmental struggles large and small .
But in the current climate , in an election year when the gun control issue is the subject of fierce and intensely partisan maneuvering -- and when mothers are considered swing voters -- such a campaign is not without risks .
Without more conventional political follow-up , some analysts say , the march could turn out to be a a day of powerful television images that will ultimately fade , and can thus be safely ignored by the legislators and candidates who are its target .
And it casts women in a political role that some may find dated and limiting : as selfless nonpartisan defenders of hearth and home .
Still , the mothers ' march , which is open to men and is to be held in the nation 's capital and some 60 other cities , could also have real power , several historians and analysts say .
`` It 's a really good way to bridge differences of ideology , '' said Annelise Orleck , an associate professor of history at Dartmouth and a scholar of mothers ' movements .
`` It makes possible at least a temporary coalition of a wider range of people than might have been drawn out by a march that was billed strictly as a gun control march . ''
And , she added : `` It becomes harder to attack .
It will be very hard for the National Rifle Association or others to attack mothers speaking on behalf of their children . ''
Kate O'Beirne , a conservative commentator and Washington editor of National Review , agreed , predicting that the march will be `` lovingly '' covered by the news media .
`` They 'll get no skeptical coverage -- moms ?
'' She added that the march , which supports an array of gun control measures like mandatory safety locks and the licensing of all handgun owners , was in fact deeply political .
But it will define the argument , she said , so that `` anybody who demurs is clearly perfectly comfortable with 8-year -olds ' risking gun violence in school cafeterias . ''
In fact , Bill Powers , spokesman for the National Rifle Association , offered a downright decorous response when asked about the mothers ' march .
`` We seem to be a lot of people 's favorite target to beat up , but the men and women who are part of the NRA want their children to be safe just as much as anyone else wants their children to be safe , '' he said .
Donna Dees - Thomases , a New Jersey mother who is the main organizer of the march , said she was galvanized by the image of children , hand in hand , being led from a Jewish community center in Granada Hills , Calif. , last August , after a gunman 's shooting rampage .
She said she took MADD as her inspiration , and found it easy to mobilize mothers in the wake of a succession of school shootings , several of them in middle-class suburbia .
`` The first five or 10 women I spoke to about this , we all had the same reaction to what was going on in the country around guns , '' she said .
`` Our maternal instincts were just kicking in . ''
In fact , some pollsters say that after the shooting last year at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo. , which left 15 dead , support for stronger gun laws initially soared , especially among women .
Moreover , there is what Linda DiVall , a Republican pollster , calls a `` huge gender gap '' on the issue .
A poll by CBS News in March found that 56 percent of the men responding said laws governing the sale of handguns should be made stricter ; 73 percent of the women did .
Some analysts say the Democratic Party 's support for stricter gun laws could help deliver the middle-of-the-road suburban mothers both parties are courting .
But polls indicate that any such advantage has yet to materialize .
Many Republican leaders have been arguing that the problem is not the strength of existing gun laws , but the lack of vigorous enforcement .
And that message has appeal , DiVall said .
Celinda Lake , a Democratic pollster , said , `` The issue 's been confused , '' but argued that the mothers ' march could sway voters .
The march 's organizers , of course , say they hope to transcend any struggle for partisan advantage .
`` Everyone truly believes that until we get the politics out of this , nothing much will get done , '' said Dees - Thomases , currently on leave from her job as a part-time publicist for CBS .
`` This is a public health issue . ''

The march 's Web site drives home the beyond-politics message again and again : `` This is personal , not political .
We are in this for one reason alone : to keep our kids safe . ''
In a `` Tapestry '' section , typical postings about the march run like this : `` I lose sleep at night thinking about the future of my 3-year -old child and my one expected in June . ''
`` After watching the Oprah show on Tuesday , I decided to turn in the only gun I have , a handgun . ''
March organizers say elected officials will not be prominently featured in the day 's program in Washington , although two will speak , both of them women with experience in gun violence in their own families : Rep. Carolyn McCarthy , D - N.Y. , whose husband was killed and son was severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in 1993 , and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy .
Theda Skocpol , a professor of government and sociology at Harvard , said the march organizers had clearly `` rediscovered a very traditional formula '' that still had power even though the status of women has been transformed .
Skocpol , the author of `` Protecting Soldiers and Mothers : The Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States '' -LRB- Harvard University Press , 1992 -RRB- , noted that mothers ' movements were very strong in the early years of the 20th century , before women had the vote , when many women defined the political process `` not as voting , but as shaping public opinion , creating some kind of moral consensus , appealing to the reason and the values of public officials . ''
In her book , she quotes Imogen B. Oakley , a leader in the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , who declared in 1912 : `` In this country , owing to partisan politics , the authorities are prone to spend so much time wrangling over the spoils of office that they have little left for civic improvement . ''
As a result , she said , `` the initiative in civic matters has devolved largely upon women . ''
Rheta Childe Dorr , the author of a book about clubwomen in politics , wrote in 1910 that a woman 's place was in the home .
But she added : `` Home is not contained within the four walls of an individual home .
Home is the community .
The city full of people is the family .
The public school is the real nursery .
And badly do the home and the family and the nursery need their mother . ''
The framing of an issue as a mothers ' movement still works `` not because they see women separately , as part of a separate sphere , but because women are still especially concerned about children , '' Skocpol said .
Still , she and many analysts say there are obvious limitations to these movements .
Efforts to recast poverty as a children 's issue -- including a Stand for Children rally in Washington in 1996 -- did not stop the passage of a welfare reform law that its organizers deplored .
Powerful images are no substitute for political muscle and continued organizing .
Dees - Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that , and will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march .
In the meantime , the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war : the Second Amendment Sisters , a group of women who plan a counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights , to underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home .
