Imagine, for example, a substance synthesized by one pathway and immediately broken down by another. The cell would be spinning its metabolic wheels. Actually, a cell tightly regulates its metabolic pathways by controlling when and where its various enzymes are active. It does this either by switching on and off the genes that encode specific enzymes (as we will discuss in Unit Three) or, as we discuss here, by regulating the activity of enzymes once they are made.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
