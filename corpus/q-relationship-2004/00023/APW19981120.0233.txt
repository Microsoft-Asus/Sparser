NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Nearly 1,000 children demonstrated in the Indian capital on Friday , calling on politicians running in upcoming local elections to support their campaign against child labor .
The children , aged four to 14 , formed a human chain at a busy intersection and distributed pamphlets to motorists and passersby urging them to pressure politicians to eliminate child labor from the state of New Delhi .
New Delhi has about half a million child laborers , said Kailash Satyarthi , whose South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude organized the demonstration .
Among those marching were children the coalition had rescued from jobs as maids and dishwashers in conditions near slavery .
The voting next week in the states of Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram and in New Delhi , which is governed as its own state , is being projected by the opposition as a referendum on the performance of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's eight-month -old government .
If his Bharatiya Janata Party makes a poor showing , other parties in his 19-member coalition may abandon him .
Satyarthi 's group and four other development organizations jumped into the fray , urging voters to elect only those candidates who sign a petition pledging to eliminate child labor and promising free and compulsory primary education .
In New Delhi , 95 contestants from various political parties have signed the petition and 18 declined , said Satyarthi .
A similar campaign has been launched in the three other states .
Last month , a position paper released jointly by 16 U.N. offices in New Delhi said India had the largest number of child workers in the world , with estimates by voluntary agencies ranging between 40 million and 100 million .
Many children work in agriculture , the carpet , and firework-making industries , stitching footballs , restaurants and child prostitution .
