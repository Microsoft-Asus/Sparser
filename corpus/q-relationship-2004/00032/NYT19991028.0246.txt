The killing of at least seven top Armenian officials , including the prime minister , in the Armenian parliament Wednesday may be connected with corruption and factionalism within the government , specialists on the region said Wednesday night .
The motives of the assailants were still a mystery , and whether the prime minister , Vazgan Sarkissian , was the specific target of the shooting is unclear .
But he was a leader of a younger generation of Armenian politicians , and had key responsibility in the economy , deciding state subsidies and the award of government contracts .
`` Sarkissian is -LRB- sic -RRB- a very powerful figure domestically .
Strong arm tactics get used , and this episode could have been arranged by interests who had lost out in the division of the spoils -- or by radicals protesting the corruption in the way business is done , '' said Anna Matveeva , a specialist on TransCaucasia at the Royal Institute for International Affairs -LRB- RIIA -RRB- in London .
The reported words of one of the gunmen , that they opposed `` those who have drunk the blood of the nation , '' could be interpreted in that sense , she added .
Another , connected , possibility is that the attack stems from a feud within the governing coalition .
`` Armenian politics is volatile , and political assassinations happen there .
Basically , this sort of thing is do-able in Armenia , '' Matveeva said .
Either way , it appears less plausible that the episode reflects disagreement over the fate of Nagorno - Karabakh , an overwhelmingly Armenian -populated enclave within the legal frontiers of Azerbaijan -- the issue that brought down the previous president , Levon Ter - Petrosian .
Like President Robert Kocharian , who appointed him prime minister in June , Sarkissian has long been a hardliner on Nagorno - Karabakh , and helped force the resignation of Ter - Petrosian last year .
Fighting first broke out over the enclave in 1988 , as separatists sought to reunite it with Armenia , from which Nagorno - Karabakh was severed by Stalin in the 1920s .
After six years of hostilities , a cease-fire in 1994 left control in Armenian hands , but did not resolve the final juridical status of the region .
Today a settlement , on which Strobe Talbott , the U.S. deputy secretary of state , has also been working during his current visit to the region , looks closer than ever before .
The rumored deal would offer some face-saving device for the ailing 76-year -old Azeri president , Gaidar Aliyev , but in practical purposes the enclave would stay with Armenia .
`` Everyone in Armenia is a nationalist over Nagorno - Karabakh , '' Matveeva said .
`` It 's possible these people were ultra-hardliners trying to prevent what they claim would be a sellout to Azerbaijan , but it 's not very likely . ''
