BEIRUT , July 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Lebanese security forces have arrested five members of the mainstream Palestinian faction Fatah on charges of spying for Israel , the National Broadcast Network radio reported Tuesday .
They were suspected of being connected with a recently cracked espionage ring of 77 Lebanese who gathered data for Israel about Syrian troops in Lebanon , the Lebanese army and the Iranian -backed Hezbollah -LRB- Party of God -RRB- guerrillas in south Lebanon , the radio added .
Three of the Palestinians were arrested on Monday by Lebanese police in the country 's southern coastal city of Sidon , and the two others , including a Fatah lieutenant , were picked up by Palestinian military police in the Ein El - Hilweh Palestinian camp in Sidon .
This was the third secret ring smashed by Lebanese security apparatus in less than a month .

Some 360,000 Palestinian refugees are living in 12 camps across Lebanon .
