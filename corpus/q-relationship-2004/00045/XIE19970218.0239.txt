ROME , February 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- An Italian mayor proposed today that the children of known mafia criminals should be forcibly removed from their parents and educated elsewhere to prevent them from becoming criminals too .
The proposal was made by Pippo Cipriani , the left-wing mayor of Corleone , a Sicilian hill town forever linked with the mafia thanks to the Marlon Brando film , the Godfather .
This came one day after a 21-year -old son of a jailed mafia boss Toto Riina was sentenced to four years in prison for mafia activities .
He said that mafia children should be `` bombarded with messages and values which offer an alternative and counter their traditional values . ''
`` We must break this system of transmission of values , '' he said , `` The adults must pay for their crimes they commit , but we can save the innocent in time . ''
He suggested that special institutes be set up , funded out of the money confiscated from mafia criminals , to look after the mafia children .
However , Cipriani 's proposal immediately drew criticism from several mafia experts .
Caltanisetta deputy public prosecutor Paolo Giordano labelled it as an ideal , saying `` an imposed education , even from the best motives , could bring in negative reactions '' .
Piergiorgio Ferreri , secretary of the Association of Children 's Court Judges , held it would make the problem worse rather than solve it , asking , `` Where are we going to put thousands of children -- in a ghetto ? ''
