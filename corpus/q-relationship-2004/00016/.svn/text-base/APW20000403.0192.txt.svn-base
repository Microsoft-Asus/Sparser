JERUSALEM
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak resisted pressure from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen on Monday to cancel a deal that would supply China with a sophisticated airborne surveillance system .
However , Barak implied that Israel would be more sensitive to U.S. concerns about supplying China with arms in light of recent escalating tensions between China and U.S. -backed Taiwan .
Barak , who also serves as defense minister , said Israel was aware of the need to coordinate such arms deals with the United States but that it had already signed a contract with China for one such plane .
`` We are aware of the need to coordinate ... with the United States on every issue that might risk American interests , '' Barak said during a joint news conference with Cohen .
The United States has on several occasions expressed its displeasure over Israel 's $ 250 million plan , announced in November , to sell China the AWACS system , which allows aircraft to conduct long-range radar surveillance and coordinate forces during battle .
A plane outfitted with the system is to be delivered to China soon , and the sale of two more planes is being negotiated .
Cohen said he expressed his opposition to the sale in a meeting with Barak on Monday morning .
`` The United States does not support the sale of this kind of technology to ...
China because of the potential of changing the strategic balance in that region , '' he said .
`` With tensions running as high as they are in China and Taiwan , we see this as being counterproductive . ''
`` I have expressed that to the prime minister , '' Cohen added .
Israeli media reports said the United States has linked some of its annual $ 3 billion in foreign aid to Israel to cancellation of the deal .
However , in Washington , State Department spokesman James Rubin said that as far as he knew there were no contingencies to cut Israel 's foreign aid .
`` On the other hand , it 's fair to say that if Israel were not to respond to our concerns ... it would have some effect ; precisely what , I 'm not prepared to speculate , '' Rubin told reporters at a briefing .
Barak left open the possibility , however , of taking U.S. interests into consideration in future deals , like the proposal to provide two additional planes to China .
Meanwhile , Cohen said proposals for a U.S. - Israeli defense pact had been put on the back burner since an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as part of a peace deal with Syria did not appear likely .
`` Any discussion about this enhanced relationship was in fact in the context of the requirements that might be necessary in order to ensure Israel 's security should there be a pact , an agreement with Syria , '' Cohen said .
One version of a defense pact would declare that an attack against Israel be considered an attack against the United States .
Barak said any upgrade of the relationship would have to be done gradually , to avoid straining the United States ' relationship with moderate Arab governments .
Cohen left Israel later Monday for a trip to Cairo , Jordan and Persian Gulf states .
