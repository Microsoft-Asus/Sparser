In the spring of 1998 , Prudence Bushnell , the U.S. ambassador to Kenya , sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright begging for the secretary 's personal help .
Ms. Bushnell , a career diplomat , had been fighting for months for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot .
The department had repeatedly refused to grant her request , citing a lack of money .
But that kind of response , she wrote Albright , was `` endangering the lives of embassy personnel . ''
The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya , officials said .
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell .
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who was overly obsessed with security , according to one official .
Albright took no action .
And three months later , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">on Aug. 7 , the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously attacked with car bombs</ENAMEX> .
Twelve American diplomats and more than 200 Africans were killed in Kenya .
The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised questions about security before the bombing .
But a close examination of events in the year before the assaults , based on interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government , shows her concerns were more intense , more well-founded , more specific , and more forcefully expressed than has previously been known .
The review shows that : -- The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in Washington and <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden , the Saudi exile who is accused of masterminding the attack</ENAMEX> .
-- The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters .
The agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded , but some officials believe the inquiry was botched , and the agency 's inspector general is investigating how it was handled .
-- State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni , commander of the U.S. Central Command , who had visited Nairobi on his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and tempting target for terrorists .
Zinni 's offer to send his own specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the State Department .
-- The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve embassy security .
Department officials had long since stopped asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards , and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it believed were at greatest risk .
Nairobi was not one of them .
Ms. Bushnell , in her first interview about the bombing , said by telephone from Nairobi on Friday : `` This is a tragedy in the real sense of the word , and it 's a tragedy that has caused us to think differently .
We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did in the past . ''
A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard American missions against terrorist attacks , particularly for the practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for terrorists .
But the report , signed by Adm. William Crowe , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , concluded that `` intelligence provided no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks . ''
Still , classified cable traffic and intelligence reports , which were not included in the public version of Crowe 's report , show that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of terrorism on a particular day , the United States had growing evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots , and that terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya .
State Department officials insist that they were sympathetic to Ms. Bushnell 's concerns .
They added that it was impossible to respond to each terrorist threat it received .
Department officials also assert that even if Ms. Bushnell 's requests had been granted , a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the attack in August .
They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt with by Kenyan authorities .
Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising concerns about the embassy 's security soon after her arrival in Nairobi in 1996 .
She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997 , outlining the dangers and asking for a new embassy .
Her request was not seriously considered , officials said , when senior State Department officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a budget for embassy construction in the coming year .
`` It did n't come up on the radar screen , '' said one senior administration official .
This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright .
In memos sent in April and May , she asked Albright to cite Nairobi 's vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security .
In addition , Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official and member of Congress who came to Nairobi .
The ambassador would say , `` How do you like our building ?
I think it 's terrible , '' according to an American official .
Ms. Bushnell `` did not want to be in that building , '' the official said .
While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA panned out , they focused Ms. Bushnell 's attention on just how vulnerable her embassy was .
`` If you know there is a viper 's nest around , then that gives you pause , '' one State Department official said .
By the mid-1990s , the global investigation touched off by the 1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his associates .
FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a criminal case against the Saudi exile .
At the same time , the CIA was tracking the group 's movements and finances in hopes of preventing attacks .
One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin Laden 's operatives were living in the country .
Intelligence officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya .
In the summer of 1997 , American intelligence officials began to look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The CIA identified an intriguing suspect : Wadih el Hage , a Lebanese -born American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to the leadership of bin Laden 's group</ENAMEX> .
American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el Hage 's home in Nairobi , an overture that was shared with Ms. Bushnell and others in the embassy .
Kenyan police , accompanied by the CIA and FBI , searched the house in August 1997 .
They found his computer , downloaded its files , and read a letter describing the existence of an `` East African cell '' of bin Laden 's group .
The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American intelligence to investigate the group 's Kenyan operations and alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few years earlier .
According to the document , the group had moved a cache of incriminating files from el Hage 's house and hidden them elsewhere .
That reference set off alarm bells .
American officials suspected that the missing files might contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden 's Kenyan operatives .
The working theory , officials said , was that such a plot would be aimed at another country , with Nairobi used as a `` jumping off point . ''
A law enforcement official said American investigators began a `` somewhat frantic , concerted effort '' to locate the missing files .
`` The concern was high enough about something being out there to go right away , '' the official said .
As part of that effort , a second search was conducted in Kenya at another location in September 1997 .
This time , a State Department official from the embassy joined the CIA , FBI and Kenyans .
No files were found .
The FBI interviewed el Hage , who had moved to the United States , three times , but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his activities in Kenya .
Today , el Hage is in jail in New York , awaiting trial on charges of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill Americans abroad .
He has not been directly linked to the bombings in Kenya , but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile 's chief lieutenants , responsible for setting up front companies in Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Still , the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin Laden .
State Department officials insist that they were not told of this and stress that they were given only a `` fragmentary '' understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage 's house .
The officials said they were told only that the CIA was assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI .
`` At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya , '' a senior State Department official said .
Another State Department official said : `` If we had known there was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten our people the hell out of that building . ''
Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the State Department 's assertions .
The State Department , said one intelligence official , was briefed about the presence of bin Laden 's operatives in Kenya `` before , during and after '' the August 1997 raid on el Hage 's house .
Over the next year , intelligence officials said the CIA sent the State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya .
`` Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first paragraph , '' recalled one U.S. intelligence official .
In the summer of 1997 , the CIA 's Nairobi -based officers learned of another possible terrorist threat to the embassy .
The intelligence service of another country , which American officials declined to identify , turned over an informant to the CIA .
In a series of conversations , the informant said that the Nairobi branch of an Islamic charity , the Al - Haramain Foundation , was plotting terrorist attacks against Americans , according to government officials .
The informant eventually warned that the group was plotting to blow up the American embassy in Nairobi .
Officials said the CIA 's station chief in Nairobi relayed the threats to the ambassador and other embassy officials , touching off a dispute between the agencies over what to do next .
Senior diplomats at the embassy wanted the CIA to ask the Kenyan authorities to arrest the group 's members immediately .
But the CIA 's station chief , uncertain about the credibility of the informant , initially favored keeping an eye on the group , according to American officials .
The diplomats prevailed , and on Oct. 31 , the Kenyans arrested nine Arabs connected to Al - Haramain , and seized the group 's files .
While the United States receives thousands of terrorist threats a year , this one was taken so seriously that the CIA took the unusual step of sending a team of counter-terrorism specialists from its Langley , Va. , headquarters to Nairobi to investigate .
The CIA team , which included an Arab linguist , scoured Al - Haramain 's seized files , but could find no evidence of a bomb plot .
Members of the counter-terrorism team then wanted to question the Al - Haramain members in jail , to make sure they were not missing any clues .
But that request set off another dispute , officials said .
The agency 's station chief , the highest ranking CIA officer in Nairobi , refused to ask the Kenyans for access to the Al - Haramain suspects , insisting that he had pushed his local counterparts far enough .
The station chief said he did not want to strain his relations with the Kenyans .
Senior officials at CIA headquarters urged the station chief to reconsider , but they said the decision was ultimately his , and he held his ground .
There were no interviews .
Because the documents seized from the group 's offices showed no evidence of a bombing plot , the CIA soon dropped its investigation .
Without any evidence against Al - Haramain , the agency concluded that its informant was not credible , officials said .
Kenya washed its hands of the group , ordering the nine deported .
But some members of the counter-terrorism team were furious , officials said , and complained that their investigation had been dangerously short-circuited .
They felt they were unable to conduct a thorough investigation without talking to the suspects themselves .
Some team members blamed the decision on the station chief 's lack of field experience ; he was a career analyst from the CIA 's directorate of intelligence on his first overseas espionage assignment .
Embassy officials say they were not aware of the internal CIA dispute , and add that they assumed at the time that it was the Kenyans who had denied access to the suspects .
`` Why would you not want to interview them ? '' asked one State Department official .
Ms. Bushnell was told of the findings of the inquiry , and assured that the threat had been eliminated by the arrests .
In fact , there were some lingering questions .
Some intelligence officials believed at the time that members of the charity were tied to bin Laden .
It was , perhaps , another clue about possible terrorist activity in Kenya .
However , the CIA did not circulate any intelligence reports throughout the rest of the government about the case .
Today , intelligence officials insist there is no evidence linking the group to the embassy bombings .
But they say they now have evidence that connects them to bin Laden .
The agency 's inspector general is examining the case .
A third warning surfaced in November , 1997 .
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed , an Egyptian , walked into the embassy and told CIA officers he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck inside the diplomats ' underground parking garage .
In a separate interrogation by Kenyan security officials , which was relayed to the Americans , Ahmed made his own involvement in the plot clear , saying he had already taken surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack , which he said was to involve several vehicles and stun grenades .
The CIA issued two intelligence reports on Ahmed 's statements , but cautioned in its reports that Ahmed may have fabricated his story , thus downplaying the significance of the warning .
But Ahmed is now being held in jail in Tanzania in connection with the Dar es Salaam embassy bombing , and U.S. officials still are n't sure what to make of his 1997 warning .
The warnings in August and November prompted Ms. Bushnell to renew her case for a new embassy .
On December 15 , 1997 , she sent a report back to State Department headquarters warning that the embassy 's location made it `` extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack , '' and that it had to be replaced with a more secure building .
Less than two weeks later , on December 24th , she sent another cable noting again that `` the embassy 's security profile , in a congested , downtown location , is cause for serious concern , '' and asked for a comprehensive review of the embassy 's security status .
She also asked that State Department officials go back to Congress to ask for more money in order to fund a new Nairobi embassy .
Senior officials were not swayed , arguing that the dangers were nonexistent or already dissipated .
Ahmed 's warning , one senior official said , had been largely discounted as not credible .
The Kenyans had taken care of the more serious threat , he said , by arresting members of al- Haramain .
In a January 1998 budget review concerning embassy construction funding , which included Undersecretary of State for Management Bonnie Cohen and other senior officials , Ms. Bushnell 's request was not seriously considered , officials acknowledged .
In a response to her warnings of a worsening terrorist threat , in a January 1998 cable , Ms. Bushnell was told by headquarters that other embassy projects had priority , and that a new Nairobi embassy was not in the State Department 's future plans .
The cable said that headquarters agreed that a `` new chancery would be ideal , '' but that State `` had reviewed the case and understood her concerns '' and had turned her down .
In fact , the State Department had a long wish list of embassies it eventually wanted to replace , and Nairobi was not on it .
Congressional and State Department officials say that , prior to the August embassy bombings , State asked Congress to include funds in its fiscal 1999 budget for only two new embassies -- in Beijing and Berlin .
Those were the only new embassies the State Department had sought congressional funding for since at least fiscal 1996 .
Ms. Bushnell 's increasingly insistent demands for a new embassy were so far out of step with the State Department 's plans that officials at headquarters were beginning to see her as a nuisance who was obsessed by security , according to one official familiar with the matter .
But in addition to the terrorist threats , Ms. Bushnell had other reasons for concern about security , including street crime and local political violence .
In early 1998 , the CIA 's deputy station chief in Nairobi was mugged near the building .
Ms. Bushnell , officials disclosed , had been told about a plot to kill her in early 1998 as well .
And local police refused to guard the embassy , and sometimes beat up political dissidents right in front of the building , according to an American official .
Still , even similar warnings from other senior government officials failed to persuade the State Department to change its mind .
Zinni sent a cable to the State Department warning that the embassy was vulnerable to a terrorist attack after having seen security conditions at the embassy for himself .
In the cable , Zinni offered to send a security team from CentCom to review security at the embassy , but his offer was turned down by the State Department because it already was planning to send its own team to placate Ms. Bushnell .
In March 1998 , a team from diplomatic security and the foreign building office , which handles embassy leases and construction projects , arrived in Nairobi to conduct a security review .
In March , officials updated the security assessment last conducted at the embassy in 1994 , and found that the embassy was in compliance with the security standards the State Department had established for a post facing a medium terrorist threat .
Security recommendations made in 1994 had been carried out , the review found .
A week later , the team sent out from Washington conducted its review , and proposed about $ 500,000 worth of new security measures , including the installation of a new fence around the front parking lot , upgrading perimeter surveillance , and construction of a fence in front of the embassy 's front entrance .
In March , funding for a special roll-down door for the underground parking garage was approved .
Two months later , funding for a similar door for the front entrance of the building and a new perimeter fence was approved .
But by the time of the attack , only the garage door had been installed .
Immediately after the attack , the State Department said it had been planning to spend about $ 3 million in 1999 to upgrade security at the embassy .
But officials now acknowledge that most of the money was earmarked for interior remodeling , and only a small portion was to go for security .
`` We felt they should n't bother to renovate , '' one official said .
`` We said they should use that money for a new building . ''
In the wake of the bombings , the Clinton administration has also asked Congress for $ 1.8 billion to improve security at diplomatic posts around the world , and to build new embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam .
On Friday , the Crowe panel included among its recommendations that State spend an additional $ 1.4 a year over the next decade .
And just before Christmas , the State Department briefly closed the embassy in Nairobi after the U.S. was warned that bin Laden and his group might be ready to strike again .
