BEIJING , April 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The `` One China '' principle is an issue of right and wrong , and China will by no means compromise and give in on this matter of principle , a senior Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs said here today .
Some people in Taiwan 's industrial and commercial fields openly clamor for `` Taiwan independence '' and advocate the `` Lee Teng -hui Line '' , which preaches the breakup of the motherland .
It has exerted a bad influence , said Li Bingcai , deputy director of China ` s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party .
Meanwhile , they scrabble for profits by engaging in business and economic operations on the mainland of China .
Such a situation will not be allowed to continue , Li said .
The majority of the people in the industrial and commercial circles of Taiwan stand for developing cross-straits relations , and oppose `` Taiwan independence '' , indicating their strong desire for peace and stability , he pointed out .
`` We encourage them to make investments and conduct other economic activities on the mainland .
We will continue to implement the policy of giving preferential treatment to Taiwan investors and adopting an appropriately relaxed policy , and protect their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law , '' Li said .
The mainland of China enjoys political and social stability , and steady economic growth .
The recently-launched strategy of speeding up economic development in the western part of China holds out great opportunities for Taiwan compatriots who wish to invest in and conduct business activities on the Chinese mainland , he said .
