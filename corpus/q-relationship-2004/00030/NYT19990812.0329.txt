WASHINGTON --
Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday the federal government should consider requiring all firearm owners to be licensed , going further than the gun-control measures President Clinton has proposed .
Clinton , reacting to Reno 's comments , said he `` strongly '' supports and associates himself with the suggestion .
But the president declined to add licensing to a wide-ranging gun-control proposal he has presented to Congress and which lawmakers have largely rejected .
Reno 's and Clinton 's comments followed the Wednesday surrender of Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. , a white supremacist and neo- Nazi charged with attempting to kill two youngsters , a teen-ager and an adult Tuesday at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles .
Furrow , who surrendered to FBI agents in Las Vegas and was returned to Los Angeles , also is charged with killing U.S. postal worker Joseph Ileto after the center attack .
Reno , speaking at her weekly news briefing , said licensing of gun owners should be part of broader legislation aimed at preventing felons and children from gaining access to firearms .
`` We are never going to get a serious grip on gun violence in this country until we adopt comprehensive measures to keep guns away from those who should not have them , '' Reno said .
`` I believe we must seriously explore the possibility of requiring the licensing of all handguns , '' she said .
`` It is common sense , pure common sense , to ensure that guns are only in the hands of those who know how to safely and lawfully use them and have the capacity and willingness to do so . ''
Clinton , though endorsing Reno 's comments , urged Congress to go no further than supporting his existing gun-control proposal , which includes raising the legal age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21 , placing trigger locks on weapons and holding parents responsible if children gain illicit access to guns .
The president called the shootings in Los Angeles `` another compelling argument for the passage of the ... common-sense gun legislation we have recommended . ''
White House spokesman Barry Toiv , explaining the president 's position , said Clinton , `` has had some positive things to say '' about the potential licensing of gun owners .
But the president `` right now -LRB- is -RRB- focused ... on trying to get through the Congress sensible ideas for limiting access to guns to criminals and to children in order to protect children , '' Toiv said .
Reno 's suggestion that gun owners be licensed echoed similar recommendations from Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley , who are running for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Texas Gov. George W. Bush , the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination , has assailed licensing proposals , saying they will not discourage hardened criminals from using guns .
The Justice Department is investigating Furrow 's attacks to determine if anti-semitism or prejudice against Asians motivated the violence , in which case U.S. prosecutors could charge him under the federal hate-crime statute .
Reno , citing the possibility of prejudice as a motive for the shootings , reiterated the Clinton administration 's largely unsuccessful call for Congress to pass stronger laws prohibiting hate crimes and tightening gun control .
The attorney general also urged adults to teach children to be tolerant of ethnic differences in order to stop the the cycle of violence driven by prejudice .
`` Eliminating hate crimes and eliminating bigotry and bitterness are among this nation 's most important and most enduring challenges , '' Reno said .
`` We must do more to teach our children tolerance and make sure that they learn to accept all people , regardless of their race , religion , nationality or sexual orientation . ''
In Congress , the Republican -led House and Senate have been unwilling to broaden federal hate-crime and gun-control laws .
For example , Clinton has proposed extending to women , homosexuals and disabled people the same protection from hate crimes that racial , religious and national-origin minorities now have .
But many House and Senate Republicans oppose expanding the law , saying instead that states should receive greater federal assistance in combating and prosecuting crimes under the existing statute .
Lawmakers also have largely rejected the president 's gun-control proposal .
The Senate , after rancorous debate , has approved legislation that would require background checks be performed before a person can buy firearms at gun shows .
But the House has refused to close what the White House calls the gun-show loophole , prompting the administration to urge lawmakers to adopt the Senate version when Congress returns to work after Labor Day .
`` This is a critical time in our nation 's history , '' Reno said .
`` We can go into the next century with a realistic prospect of ending the culture of violence in this country .
It is critical that we do so now . ''
