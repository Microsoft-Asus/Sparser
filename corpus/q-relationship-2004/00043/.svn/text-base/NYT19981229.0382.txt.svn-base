They smuggle drugs .
They extort money .
They kill people who get in their way .
And they do it all from behind bars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">They are prison gangs , locked in a struggle for control of their cellblock homes , with criminal tentacles reaching outside jail walls .
No one knows this better than Arizona prisons director Terry Stewart , who was allegedly targeted for assassination last month by the New Mexican Mafia , a violent gang with growing influence in Arizona prisons </ENAMEX>.
Stewart survived when gunmen were scared off by the chance appearance of Phoenix police officers at a Valley restaurant .
But experts in Arizona and across the nation say the core issue remains : Who 's in charge , the gangs or the guards ?
Bill Haro , who spent 16 years as an Arizona correctional officer and managed gang inmates at Arizona State Prison - Florence , said the public cannot fathom what it 's like for 18 guards to oversee a yard with 600 inmates .
`` We run the prisons only because they let us run the prisons , '' said Haro .
`` We 're talking about organized crime , and they 're good at it ...
These guys play for keeps .
They 'll cut your heart out . ''
Mark Fleisher , a former prison administrator and author of books on prison violence and gangs , emphasizes that whoever holds the gun has the power .
`` Ultimately , the staff has the M -16s , '' he says .
`` They control the fence line .
As long as the staff controls the fence line , the staff controls the prison . ''
But Fleisher does not underestimate the influence -- or ruthlessness -- of inmate gangs such as the Aryan Brotherhood , the Mexican Mafia and the Mau Mau .
`` If you get in their way , they 'll kill you , '' he said .
`` They 're like carpenter ants .
They 'll eat right through you .
They 'll just keep coming and coming and coming , and they 'll get you . ''
The magnitude of the problem is reflected in the numbers of inmates affected by prison gangs : An estimated 5.7 million adults are behind bars or on parole nationwide , including 24,000 Arizona state prison inmates , and thousands more in county or federal institutions here .
About one of every 10 federal prisoners is in a gang , experts say , while many more are associated with gangs , while not full-time members .
State corrections officials do n't know how many Arizona inmates belong to gangs , but estimate affiliation at about 1,000 inmates .
Gangs thrive wherever inmates live , said James Purpin of the American Correctional Association .
But Arizona is particularly fertile ground , he said , because of its dense metropolitan areas , as well as being close to to California gangs and Mexico .
Like other experts , Purpin said America 's prison gangs have swelled in membership and influence , complicating the job of correctional officers -- and police on the outside .
Haro , the former prison guard , said gang leaders rule by fear and attain status `` by being the most vicious -LRB- expletives -RRB- you can be .
They talk the talk , but they walk the walk . ''
Gangs control the prison econ omy , he added , and illicit drugs empower them even more , because money is as much a commodity inside the walls as outside .
`` Some of these guys have hun dreds of thousands of dollars on the books -LRB- within the prison -RRB- , '' Haro said .
`` And some of them have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the street in banks . ''
But brutal discipline , based on violence and organization , is the key to control .
`` The prison gang is always much more structured than a street gang because they 're adult criminals , '' said Fleisher .
`` They have a lot of experience inside institutions , a lot of experience in crime .
They share a purpose .
`` In this case the purpose is to engage in profitable criminal activi ties , and to control the inside of the prison . ''
Under guard and lockdown , gang leaders rely on elaborate communi cation networks that reach beyond prison walls .
Inmates whisper in the yards .
Trustees pass information while at various jobs .
Prisoners use an assortment of codes for tapping messages in the cellblocks and exchanging mail with confederates outside .
`` They have a network estab lished that 's better than our radios , '' Haro said .
To an outsider , it may seem incredible that criminals are able to get drugs and weapons past metal detectors or armed guards .
But Haro said it happens every day .
Corrupt employees who earn meager salaries are paid to smuggle narcotics or look the other way .
A broken television is sent out for repairs and comes back with syrin ges concealed inside .
Female visi tors hide drugs and pass them to prisoners when they give a greeting kiss .
The result : About one-fourth of the inmates at SMU II in Florence register dirty on routine drug tests , Haro said , and that 's the maximum security facility .
`` We 've never had enough staff or resources to be able to prevent it , '' he added .
`` And the bottom line is , that 's prison life . ''
Subhead : New inmates , known as `` fish , '' are screened by gang leaders , as well as prison authorities .
If the newcomer is a child molester , he becomes prey for beatings .
If he has wealthy family , he is an extortion target .
Phoenix police Det. Jack Ballen tine , who has investigated prison gangs for about 10 years , said inmates are approached first based on ethnic background .
`` If you are Hispanic , for in stance , you want to be protected from the white and Black gangs , '' he said .
`` You do n't want to be punked when you get in there : jumped in the shower and made some guy 's girlfriend .
You want them to know you have friends , so the message is , ` Do n't mess with me or my guys will take care of you . ' ''
Ballentine said some try to re main neutral , `` But it 's very tough , because they always , always pay you a visit when you get in .
They always learn about you , it 's a given ...
You either ` clique-up ' with a gang and get yourself taken care of or you fight the system and you have no protection .
But earning a gang `` patch , '' or full membership , is no easy matter .
Experts all emphasize the `` blood-in , blood-out '' code of prison gangs : An inmate must kill or do serious violence to join , and faces a death sentence for renounc ing membership .
Steve Benitez , an ex-member of the New Mexican Mafia , learned that the hard way .
In January , five years after renouncing his gang membership , a death contract caught up with the 30-year -old criminal .
He was found slumped over a toilet in his Tucson prison cell , dead from a blade imbedded in his back .
Benitez had been in protective custody for five years , was sent to the Tucson facility despite com plaints that his life would be in danger .
A deputy director of the state Department of Corrections was dis ciplined , along with three other employees .
And U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby ripped prison admin istrators , saying their indifference to inmate safety was `` as close to voluntary manslaughter as anything I have ever seen in my life . ''
Only about 290 state inmates have been classified as bonafide gang members and housed in isola tion cells .
But thousands more form the web of associates that extends to the outside .
Meanwhile , an estimated 700 state prisoners have requested `` pro tective custody '' status -- apart from the main population -- be cause they fear for their lives .
The list includes not only former gang members , but homosexuals , child molesters and snitches .
But as of June , only 418 beds were available .
Meanwhile , Stewart 's system for dealing with gangs made him a target .
Under the policy , inmates identi fied as gang members must re nounce their membership .
Those who refuse are placed in solitary confinement for the duration of their sentences .
Those who acqui esce must provide detailed informa tion , or `` snitch , '' on gang structure and activities .
Despite the get-tough strategy , some say the gangs remain in charge .
`` Who runs the prison yards in this state ?
Any inmate -- and any correctional officer who could tes tify truthfully -- would tell you that the gangs run the yards , '' wrote attorneys Larry A. Hammond and Debbie Hill , who represent Arizona prisoners .
`` They decide where a prisoner sits in the chow hall , how much of his ` store , ' or commissary , he turns over to the open extortioners , whether he provides other ` favors ' ...
The ` fish , '' as every new inmate coming onto a yard is called , quickly discovers who , from his racial or ethnic group , runs the house . ''
Prison gangs are a particularly difficult problem for law enforcement because leaders are behind bars already -- often for life -- so arrests and convictions have a negligible effect .
And moving them to new penitentiaries may only spread their influence .
In California , 12 members of the Mexican Mafia were sentenced this year for racketeering , murder , extor tion and drug conspiracy that reached deep into Hispanic barrios .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Despite the conviction of gang leaders who already were in the state 's toughest penal institution -- Eme , as the gang is called , contin ued organizing local street gangs and levying `` taxes '' on drug deal ers</ENAMEX> .
The problem is complicated by the difficulty in identifying gang members .
Haro said those with tattoos are relatively easy to classify .
Aryan Brotherhood members , for example , may wear their `` patch '' on an arm , a knuckle -- even the penis .
But that alone is not enough .
Sgt. P.J. Ferrero of the Phoenix police gang squad said members are `` get ting clever and not wearing tattoos anymore .
They have their gang tattoo , or patch , as they call it , on a piece of paper they carry around with them . ''
In the wake of the threats on his life , Stewart refused to back down .
`` We have long had a problem with gang members victimizing other inmates , '' he said .
`` If you have a threat from an individual then you can separate that individual and the threat is over .
`` But if it 's a gang then it 's difficult to place a person anywhere in a system where you can ensure the gang ca n't get to them .
When you are on a gang 's hit list , you are in trouble . ''
