ISTANBUL , Turkey --
President Clinton and European leaders rebuked Russia on Thursday for its military action in Chechnya , but Boris Yelstin refused to yield on Moscow 's campaign to stamp out an internal rebellion .
Later , Russia agreed to allow Knut Vollebaek , chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , to travel to Chechnya and work on the possibility of a political settlement .
But Russian officials gave no indication that the eight-week bombing attack on civilians and rebels would end .
Clinton and Yeltsin provided the dramatic moments of the first OSCE meeting in four years as Europe 's 54-member crisis management group seeks to redefine its role in a post- Cold War era .
Many of the representatives used their opening statements to criticize Russia .
`` You have no right to criticize Russia for Chechnya , '' Yeltsin said when it was his turn to speak .
He referred to the Chechen Islamic rebels as bandits and terrorists who now threaten Russia but who could grow to threaten other nations as well .
He said insurgents had claimed more than 1,500 Russian lives in terrorist bombings in Moscow and other major cities .
Chechens also had kidnapped nearly 1,000 people of many nationalities .
He suggested Islamic fundamentalists were helping finance the campaign .
`` For terrorists , considerations of proportionality or humanitarian concerns simply do not arise , because their purpose is to sow death and destruction , '' Yeltsin complained .
Yeltsin urged OSCE to stay out of the internal affairs of other nations , even on the pretext of humanitarian reasons , and he pointedly criticized `` the aggression of NATO headed by the United States '' against Yugoslavia this spring as the European alliance protected the Kosovo province from Belgrade .
Clinton , who scribbled additions into the margins of his prepared speech , turned to Yeltsin and urged him to recall the day he climbed atop the tank in Moscow and stopped a coup against the nascent democracy .
The moment , Clinton recalled , was a `` thrilling experience '' to watch .
`` If they had put you in jail instead of electing you president , I would hope that every leader of every country around this table would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said , ` well , that is an internal Russia affair that we cannot be a part of . '
I do n't think we have any choice but to try to work for common objectives across lines , '' Clinton said , speaking directly to Yeltsin seated 30 feet away .
Clinton said Russia 's critics do not object to Russia 's right to combat terrorism and to control its borders .
`` What they fear is that the means Russia has chosen will undermine its ends -- that if attacks on civilians continue , the extremism Russia is trying to combat will only intensify , '' Clinton said .
`` The strength Russia rightly is striving to build , therefore , could be eroded by an endless cycle of violence . ''
Later , Russia agreed to a change in the OSCE charter that would give the organization greater influence by stating that internal conflicts threatening regional stability were of interest to all nations .
Russia also agreed to the wording of a declaration that will recognize Moscow 's territorial integrity , condemn terrorism , offer OSCE assistance in seeking a political settlement and invite the OSCE chairman to Chechnya .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the charter change and declaration allowed OSCE to accomplish what it could in terms of Chechnya .
`` I 'm not going to oversell this .
I think that we accomplished a lot .
But this is a longer-term problem , and I think that we need to keep pushing it along and we have been given more tools to deal with it , '' Albright said .
Albright said she believed Russians `` heard a general sense of disquiet '' from OSCE members over Chechnya .
She said other foreign ministers applauded Clinton 's hand-crafted remarks for being an astute way to point out to Yeltsin why it was important for other nations to care about events within a country .
After the main OSCE meeting , Yeltsin greeted Clinton with a `` big bear hug '' as the two met for a private session , an aide said .
Samuel `` Sandy '' Berger , the national security adviser , said Clinton and Yeltsin had a `` vigorous meeting '' in which they both restated their views on Chechnya .
`` The hallmark of this relationship , however , has been the willingness of President Yeltsin and President Clinton to work through difficult issues , '' Berger said .
`` And , I do n't know that we convinced President Yeltsin on Chechnya , and he certainly did n't convince us that the course they 're on is likely to succeed . ''
Berger said Clinton urged Yeltsin to seek a political negotiation with Chechens .
He said Yeltsin invited Clinton to visit Moscow next year and they would continue their talks .
Yeltsin , who arrived Wednesday in Istanbul , left for Moscow , cutting short a session with German and French leaders .
Aides denied that Yeltsin left in a huff , contending the Russian president always had intended to leave the two-day conference early .
Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov remained in Istanbul on Russia 's behalf .
In addition to amending OSCE 's charter , member nations also are crafting a revision to the Convention Forces in Europe treaty that outlines troop levels .
The CFE is supposed to be signed Friday along with the charter , but negotiations are still underway with Russia over its troop levels in Georgia and Moldova .
