WASHINGTON --
House Republicans expressed a mixture of confusion and bitter betrayal Friday after Texas Gov. George W. Bush criticized their proposal to finance the party 's spending plans by delaying federal tax breaks for working-class families .
Opening the first serious public rift between Bush , the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination , and the party 's leadership in in Congress , Republicans said that Bush 's aides were informed several weeks ago about the proposal and never gave any indication that they found fault with it .
Bush 's strongly worded opposition to it in a statement on Thursday clearly surprised House Republican leaders , particularly House Majority Whip Tom DeLay , a fellow Texan and the plan 's author , who said on Thursday that Bush did not understand how Congress works .
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said at a news conference Friday that he had not seen it coming .
`` The proposal was floated to his people as well as others , is my understanding , and there was no response , '' he said .
But Rep. Ray LaHood , R - Ill. , accused Bush of `` a fairly significant political misstep . ''
`` We 're right on the brink of trying to conclude our session , and we 're trying to resolve some controversial issues , and he 's poking his nose in , '' LaHood said in an interview Friday night .
`` There 's a lot of resentment and anger that he 's poking his nose in at the 11th hour , '' LaHood added .
`` He needs to get on the phone and do a little explaining . ''
Bush said Friday that he stood by his statement of Thursday that House Republicans were trying to `` balance their budget on the backs of the poor . ''
He was referring to a plan to delay payments of the earned-income tax credit , a tax break for 20 million working-class Americans , in order to help finance the party 's spending plans .
`` It was a statement of principle , '' Bush said Friday , in a serene , confident manner that suggested he was not ruffled by the reaction of some House Republicans .
`` And I still believe today what I said yesterday . ''
Mindy Tucker , a spokeswoman for Bush , later added that Bush , who is one of many contenders for the Republican presidential nomination , does not coordinate his plans or statements with congressional Republicans .
`` That 's not our role , '' Ms. Tucker said .
The chain of events suggested that although Bush has enjoyed a good relationship with House Republicans to this point , and although he has received endorsements from about two-thirds of them , he will not be marching in lock step with them toward the 2000 elections .
Several political analysts said that Bush was trying to establish some distance from House Republicans , who have often come across as ideologues embroiled in unending partisan feuds .
Bush , by contrast , has campaigned on the dual assertions that he is not a Washington insider and that he is an inclusive , peacemaking , compassionate conservative .
`` Much to their chagrin , the House Republicans became the foil for Bush 's attempts to establish himself as a compassionate conservative , '' said Marshall Wittmann , an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
Referring to President Clinton 's famed habit of finding the broad center of issues , Wittmann added , `` It was a triangulation moment and a declaration of independence by Bush .
The irony here is that congressional Republicans have linked their fate in 2000 to his success . ''
Bush and several advisers said his intention was not to separate himself from House Republicans .
Bush noted that he did not issue an announcement about his opposition to the Republican plan , but rather responded to a specific question he was asked by a reporter .
But one senior House Republican aide said that Bush 's remark seemed more calculated than that , and that it indicated that he had already figured out his position and therefore could have flagged House Republican leaders .
`` Do n't tell me it was an off-the-cuff remark to say ` balancing the budget on the backs of the poor , ' '' said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
`` The wording 's too good . ''
The aide said that several of Hastert 's staff members had traveled to Austin , Texas , several weeks ago to talk to Bush 's policy director , Josh Bolton , about several upcoming issues in Congress , including the Republican plan to propose spreading out payments of the earned-income tax credit , currently paid in one lump sum .
Bolton indicated no opposition to it , the aide said .
`` We were double-crossed , '' the aide said .
Ms. Tucker said that Bolton did not remember the plan ever being mentioned during the meeting .
In one sense , Bush 's dissent merely reflected the sharp disagreements among Republicans in Congress about the plan , which now appears doomed .
`` We do n't agree with each other all the time , so why should he agree with us all the time ? '' said Rep. Roy Blunt , R - Mo. , who is Bush 's point man in the House .
Blunt said that any pique at Bush was not widespread among House Republicans , who he said appreciated Bush 's intention , stated several months ago , not to campaign against Congress .
LaHood said that he did not believe that Bush was deliberately reversing that course with Thursday 's statement , which LaHood chalked up to `` political naivete . ''
He added , `` These kinds of things ca n't happen if he wants to continue to work as a team with those of us who want to support him . ''
John Feehery , a spokesman for Hastert , suggested that Bush has an interest in making House Republicans look good .
`` It would be much better for Gov. Bush if he had a Republican Congress to work with as president , '' Feehery said .
`` We hope he keeps that in mind . ''
