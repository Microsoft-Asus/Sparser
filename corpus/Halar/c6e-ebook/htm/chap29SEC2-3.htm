Light and carbon dioxide are mainly available aboveground; water and mineral nutrients are found mainly in the soil. Thus, the complex bodies of plants show varying degrees of structural specialization for subterranean and aerial organs--roots and leaf-bearing shoots, respectively, in most plants.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Though plants cannot move from place to place, the elongation and branching of their shoots and roots maximize their exposure to environmental resources. This growth in length is sustained throughout the life of a plant by the activity of <span class="Emphasis2">apical meristems,</span> localized regions of cell division at the tips of shoots and roots (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.3</span>). Cells produced by these meristems differentiate into the plant’s various tissues, including a surface epidermis that protects the body and several types of internal tissues.

This type of reproductive cycle, called <span class="Emphasis2">alternation of generations,</span> also evolved in various groups of algae (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.24</span>). However, alternation of generations does <span class="Emphasis1">not</span> occur in the charophyceans, the algae most closely related to land plants. We can infer from this observation that alternation of generations evolved independently as a derived characteristic of land plants that was not present in the ancestor common to land plants and charophyceans.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">The two multicellular body forms that alternate in the life cycles of land plants are the gametophyte and sporophyte generations. The cells of the <span class="Emphasis2">gametophyte</span> are haploid, meaning that they have a single set of chromosomes (see Chapter 13). The gametophyte is named for its production of gametes--eggs and sperm. Fusion of eggs and sperm during the process of fertilization forms diploid zygotes. Mitotic division of the zygote produces the multicellular sporophyte. Thus, the cells of a <span class="Emphasis2">sporophyte</span> are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, one set contributed by each gamete. Meiosis in a mature sporophyte produces haploid reproductive cells called spores (hence the name sporophyte). A <span class="Emphasis2">spore</span> is a reproductive cell that can develop into a new organism without fusing with another cell (in contrast to gametes, which cannot develop directly into a multicellular organism; they must first fuse to form zygotes). Mitotic division of a plant spore produces a new multicellular gametophyte. And so the alternation of generations continues, sporophytes producing spores that develop into gametophytes, and gametophytes producing gametes that unite to form the zygotes that develop into sporophytes (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.6</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-6','../fig/big/fig29-6.jpg','fig29-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-6.jpg" alt="fig29-6" name="myfig29-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Alternation of generations: a generalized scheme.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Don’t confuse alternation of generations with the more general occurrence of haploid and diploid stages in the life cycles of <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> sexually reproducing organisms, including animals (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.4</span>). In humans, for example, meiosis in the gonads (ovaries and testes) produces haploid gametes, which unite to form diploid zygotes. In this case, the only haploid stage in the life cycle is the gamete, which is single-celled. What distinguishes alternation of generations as a special type of haploid <img align="middle" src="../img/sym/harrow.gif"> diploid sexual cycle is that <span class="Emphasis1">both</span> stages are represented by multicellular bodies.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">In some algae with alternation of generations, the multicellular sporophyte and gametophyte look alike to the unaided eye, though microscopic examination would reveal the difference in chromosome count. However, in other algal groups and <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> land plants, the sporophyte and gametophyte generations are very different in their morphology.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">The relative size and complexity of the sporophyte and gametophyte depend on the plant group. In bryophytes, the gametophyte is the "dominant" generation--that is, the organism that is larger and more conspicuous. In contrast, the sporophyte form is the dominant generation in the life cycles of pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. For example, the fern plant most of us are familiar with--the plant with the fronds as leaves--is the diploid sporophyte. The gametophyte is a tiny plant on the forest floor.</p><p class="Header3">Walled Spores Produced in Sporangia</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Plant spores are haploid reproductive cells that have the potential to grow into multicellular, haploid gametophytes by mitosis (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.6</span>).
