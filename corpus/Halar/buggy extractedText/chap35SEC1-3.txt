MECHANISMS OF PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

 

 Molecular biology is revolutionizing the study of plants



 

 Growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation produce the plant body



 

 Growth involves both cell division and cell expansion



 

 Morphogenesis depends on pattern formation



 

 Cellular differentiation depends on the control of gene expression



 

 Clonal analysis of the shoot apex emphasizes the importance of a cell's location in its developmental fate



 

 Phase changes mark major shifts in development



 

 Genes controlling transcription play key roles in a meristem's change from a vegetative to a floral phase



A plant begins life as a single cell, the zygote formed by the union of egg and sperm. (Fertilization and embryonic development in plants are described in Chapter 38.) The main objective of plant developmental biology is to understand how this single cell gives rise to a multicellular plant of particular form with functionally integrated cells, tissues, and organs. With each meristematic cell possessing the same genetic information, why should one cell become a sieve-tube member in the phloem while another becomes a vessel element in the xylem? Or why should a particular region of the shoot apex give rise to leaves at one time and later to flowers? In considering these questions, we must bear in mind that plants have tremendous developmental plasticity. A plant's form, including height, branching patterns, and reproductive output, is greatly influenced by environmental factors, and a broad range of morphologies can result from the same genotype. (Chapter 39 considers how plants respond to environmental factors.)

Three developmental processes acting in concert are responsible for transforming the fertilized egg into a plant: growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation. The modern techniques of molecular biology are helping plant biologists explore how these processes give rise to plant form.
