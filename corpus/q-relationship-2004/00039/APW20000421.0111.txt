-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russia 's coast guard fired on a Japanese fishing boat and seized it Friday near a long-disputed chain of islands , but both sides played down the possibility the shooting would strain relations .
None of the 20 crew members aboard the boat were injured , Japanese officials said .
The incident is the latest in a series of disputes over fishing waters between the two nations .
Russia and Japan have yet to sign a peace treaty formally ending World War II because of a dispute over the Kuril islands , about 150 miles north of where Friday 's incident occurred .
In Moscow , the ITAR - Tass news agency said the Russian coast guard came across the fishing boat in Russian waters with its name and number concealed .
Tokyo officials said they did not know where the pursuit began , but that it ended in Japanese northern waters when the Russian patrol fired on the fishing boat , then brought it back into Russian waters and detained it .
Japan 's Coast Guard said it sent three aircraft and four patrol boats to the scene but they were forced to turn back when the boats entered Russian waters .
Interfax news agency reported that the boat was being taken to Yuzhno - Kurilsk island , the southernmost tip of the Kurils .
Tokyo demanded the return of the crew , as well as an explanation of the shooting , the Foreign Ministry said .
Both sides , however , said the shooting would not affect relations .
`` Similar incidents have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future .
But together with the Japanese side , we are trying to keep them to a minimum , '' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov told Interfax news agency .
He said he did not believe the latest trouble will become `` a significant or dangerous trend in our relations . ''
The Japanese Foreign Ministry also said Japan - Russian relations were not likely to be harmed .
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori , who took office earlier this month , has made clear that he is eager to improve relations with Russia .
Mori , who is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week , is anxious to make progress on talks over the Kuril Islands , which were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II .
Japan and Russia agreed in 1997 to try to resolve the dispute over the islands by the end of this year , but negotiations have stalled .
Russia has fired on South Korean , Chinese and Taiwanese boats , as well as Japanese fishing boats that it suspects of poaching in their waters for rich crab , salmon and herring catches .
The last time a Russian patrol fired on a Japanese boat was in 1997 , when two Japanese fishermen were injured , one of them seriously .
Last year , Japanese boats were detained several times by Russia .
