THE VERTEBRATE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

 

 The hypothalamus and pituitary integrate many functions of the vertebrate endocrine system



 

 The pineal gland is involved in biorhythms



 

 Thyroid hormones function in development, bioenergetics, and homeostasis



 

 Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin balance blood calcium



 

 Endocrine tissues of the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon, antagonistic hormones that regulate blood glucose



 

 The adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex help the body manage stress



 

 Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior



Of the numerous hormones regulating body functions of vertebrates, some affect only one or a few tissues. Others, such as the sex hormones, which promote male and female characteristics, affect most of the tissues of the body. Some hormones, called tropic hormones, have other endocrine glands as their targets and are particularly important to our understanding of chemical coordination. In studying hormonal regulation of the vertebrate body, you may find FIGURE 45.5, showing the locations of the major endocrine glands in the human body, and TABLE 45.1, summarizing the functions of the major vertebrate hormones, especially helpful. In the text, small sketches accompanying each section will help you keep track of each gland's location. We begin our discussion of the vertebrate endocrine system by looking at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which control much of the endocrine system.

Fig 45-5. Human endocrine glands surveyed in this chapter. In addition to the glands shown here, many organs with primarily nonendocrine functions also have cells that secrete hormones. These organs, which are discussed in other chapters, include the heart, the stomach, the small intestines, the kidney, and the placenta of a pregnant woman. Also discussed elsewhere is the thymus gland, an important component of the immune system (Chapter 43). Quite large during childhood, the thymus begins to decline at puberty, when the immune system is well established. By adulthood it is largely replaced by adipose and fibrous tissue, but it continues to function throughout life. It secretes several chemical signals, including thymosin, that stimulate the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes after they leave the thymus. The other endocrine organs in this drawing are discussed in this chapter.
