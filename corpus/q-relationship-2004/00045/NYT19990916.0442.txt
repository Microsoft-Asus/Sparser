BOSTON -- Nearly $ 2 million flowed through BankBoston Corp. to a company that is under investigation for allegedly illegal activities involving billions of dollars of suspicious Russian money , sources familiar with the matter said Thursday .
The activity prompted BankBoston officials to investigate whether any links existed between the flows and a Federal Bureau of Investigation undercover operation involving a former BankBoston employee in West Newton , the sources said .
The bank 's internal probe had not turned up any evidence of a connection , according to sources .
The disclosures come in the wake of a Boston Globe report that quoted sources as saying both BankBoston and Fleet Financial Group had transferred several millions of dollars to accounts held by Benex International Co. at the Bank of New York .
Investigators in the midst of what amounts to the largest money-laundering inquiry in US history believe that nearly $ 10 billion in questionable Russia -related money passed through Benex accounts at the Bank of New York .
Officials suspect Benex , a shadowy trading company , of having ties to the Russia mafia and money laundering .
BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer confirmed Thursday that a `` handful '' of unnamed businesses and individuals had shifted money from their BankBoston accounts to the Bank of New York accounts .
Fleet also confirmed that it held accounts for Benex and individuals associated with the firm .
Fleet , New England 's largest bank and the buyer of BankBoston , is not under any type of investigation for activities related to Benex , spokesman James Mahoney said .
BankBoston officials declined to comment on whether investigators or regulators had contacted the bank , but a source familiar with the matter said he did not believe any inquiries were taking place .
Four Fleet accounts -- one in the name of Benex , and three belonging to two individuals associated with Benex and the Bank of New York -- were not used in any Benex -related wire transfers and were not suspected of any illegal activities , Mahoney said .
But sources confirmed Thursday that other accounts at Fleet had been used to shift several millions to Benex 's Bank of New York accounts .
Mahoney , who declined to comment on the other accounts , said the average balance in the Fleet Benex account over the past year was $ 111 , while the personal accounts each had average balances of less than $ 1,000 .
The latter accounts , opened through Fleet 's New York offices , belonged to Peter Berlin , a Russia -born US citizen and the head of Benex .
Berlin 's wife , Lucy Edwards , also a Russian native , was a vice president in the Bank of New York 's East European division .
Both are under investigation .
Last December , the FBI arrested an employee of BankBoston 's West Newton branch and two bank customers in a sting involving Russian immigrants who allegedly sought to launder $ 2.7 million reportedly tied to drug profits .
