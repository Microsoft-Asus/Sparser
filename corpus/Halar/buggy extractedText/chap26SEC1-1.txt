INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF LIFE

 

 Life on Earth originated between 3.5 and 4.0 billion years ago



 

 Prokaryotes dominated evolutionary history from 3.5 to 2.0 billion years ago



 

 Oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere about 2.7 billion years ago



 

 Eukaryotic life began by 2.1 billion years ago



 

 Multicellular eukaryotes evolved by 1.2 billion years ago



 

 Animal diversity exploded during the early Cambrian period



 

 Plants, fungi, and animals colonized the land about 500 million years ago



This unit of chapters compresses the history of life into a few weeks' worth of reading--like playing the "tape" of life in veryfast forward! This overview is an even briefer look at life's major episodes. FIGURE 26.1 diagrams the chronology of these episodes in the form of a phylogenetic tree, and FIGURE 26.2, on page 512, presents the same chronology with a clock analogy.

Fig 26-1. Some major episodes in the history of life. The timing of some events is based on fossil evidence. Other "dates" are based on chemical evidence or molecular clocks (see Chapter 25). Systematists continue to evaluate the evolutionary history of life's major branches, including the phylogeny of the diverse eukaryotes informally called "protists."
