The inherent differences between human siblings reflect variations in polymers, particularly DNA and proteins. Molecular differences between unrelated individuals are more extensive--and between species greater still. The diversity of macromolecules in the living world is vast, and the potential variety is effectively limitless.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">What is the basis for such diversity in life’s polymers? These molecules are constructed from only 40 to 50 common monomers and some others that occur rarely. Building an enormous variety of polymers from such a limited list of monomers is analogous to constructing hundreds of thousands of words from only 26 letters of the alphabet. The key is arrangement--variation in the linear sequence the units follow. However, this analogy falls far short of describing the great diversity of macromolecules, because most biological polymers are much longer than the longest word. Proteins, for example, are built from 20 kinds of amino acids arranged in chains that are typically hundreds of amino acids long. The molecular logic of life is simple but elegant: Small molecules common to all organisms are ordered into unique macromolecules.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">We are now ready to investigate the specific structures and functions of the four major classes of organic compounds found in cells. For each class, we will see that the large molecules have emergent properties not found in their individual building blocks.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
