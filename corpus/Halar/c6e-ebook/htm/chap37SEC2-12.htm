These carnivorous plants make their own carbohydrates by photosynthesis, but they obtain some of their nitrogen and minerals by killing and digesting insects and other small animals. Various kinds of insect traps have evolved by the modification of leaves (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 37.16</span>). The traps are usually equipped with glands that secrete digestive juices. Fortunately for the animal kingdom, this ironic turnabout is a relatively rare exception to the standard ecosystem dynamics of animals eating plants!</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig37-16','../fig/big/fig37-16.jpg','fig37-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig37-16.jpg" alt="fig37-16" name="myfig37-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 37-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Carnivorous plants. (a)</span> The Venus flytrap is a mod ified leaf with two lobes that close together rapidly enough to capture an insect. Prey that enters the trap touches sensory hairs, initiating an electrical impulse that triggers closure of the trap. Glands in the trap then secrete digestive enzymes, and nutrients are later absorbed by the modified leaf. In spite of its name, the flytrap catches more ants and grasshoppers than it does flies. <span class="Emphasis2">(b)</span> Pitcher plants use a pitfall to capture insects. Insects slip into a long water-filled funnel. After the insect drowns, it is digested by enzymes secreted into the water.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
