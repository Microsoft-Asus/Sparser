<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Russia and Japan will hold naval exercises for the first time in the Pacific Ocean next month as part of efforts to improve relations between the two forces , the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday .</ENAMEX>
Two Russian warships and two helicopters will take part in exercises with two Japanese destroyers , a training ship and five aircraft , the report said .
The exercise , to be held 400 kms -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- east of the Russian port of Vladivostok , will simulate searching for a ship in distress .
Five decades after World War II , the two nations have yet to sign a treaty , mainly because of a territorial dispute over four tiny islands in the southern Kuril chain that Soviet troops seized from Japan in the closing days of the war .
