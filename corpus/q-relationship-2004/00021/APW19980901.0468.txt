CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A delegation of Sudanese officials arrived Tuesday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli in an apparent violation of U.N. sanctions that ban flights to and from the North African country .
Libyan television , monitored in Cairo , interrupted its normal programs to show the arrival of a plane from the national carrier Sudan Airways .
It carried a delegation coming for celebrations of the 29th anniversary of the coup that brought Col. Moammar Gadhafi to power .
The television showed members of the Sudanese delegation leaving the plane chanting anti- American slogans .
`` We will not obey the Americans , '' they chanted as welcoming Libyans responded with the same words .
It was not immediately clear if the Sudanese had sought an exemption to the six-year U.N. embargo against international flights to Libya .
On Friday a Libyan plane loaded with medicines and humanitarian goods , violated the embargo by flying to Sudan .
Gadhafi said then the medicine was to make up for stocks destroyed in last month 's U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In June , the Organization of African Unity urged member states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and religious implications or those relating to official OAU work</ENAMEX> .
Several African leaders have flown to and from Libya since then in defiance of the sanctions .
The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
The United States and Britain recently reversed long-standing demands that the two men be tried only in their countries and urged a trial before Scottish judges in the Netherlands .
Libya has said it accepts the offer but wants negotiations to ensure the safety of the two men .
In the past , it urged a trial in a third country , arguing the two suspects could not get a fair trial in the United States or Britain .
