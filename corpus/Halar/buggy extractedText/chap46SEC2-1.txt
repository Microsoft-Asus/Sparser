 Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur in the animal kingdom

There are two principal modes of animal reproduction. Asexual (from the Greek, "without sex") reproduction is the creation of new individuals whose genes all come from one parent without the fusion of egg and sperm. In most cases, asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is the creation of offspring by the fusion of haploid gametes to form a zygote (fertilized egg), which is diploid. Gametes are formed by meiosis (see FIGURE 13.7). The female gamete, the ovum (unfertilized egg), is usually a relatively large and nonmotile cell. The male gamete, the spermatozoon, is generally a small, motile cell. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variability among offspring by generating unique combinations of genes inherited from two parents. By producing offspring having various phenotypes, sexual reproduction may enhance the reproductive success of parents when pathogens or other environmental factors change relatively rapidly.
