NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- India 's top security adviser on Sunday accused neighbor -- and nuclear rival -- Pakistan of having links with the five men who hijacked an Indian Airlines plane last week , holding 155 people hostage .
Speaking to Star TV , Brajesh Mishra said Indian intelligence intercepted several radio conversations between militant groups in Kashmir , confirming that Pakistan was involved .
`` It is clear it is a terrorist state , '' said Mishra , India 's National Security Adviser of longtime rival Pakistan .
`` The establishment backs terrorism . ''
The hostages were freed on Friday after being held for eight days , but the crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan , two nuclear-armed countries that have fought three wars over the past half century .
Two of those wars were over Kashmir .
India accuses Pakistan of backing a decade-long insurgency in Kashmir , the Himalayan territory that is divided between the two countries .
Pakistan denies the charge and says it provides only moral support to the movement .
The five hijackers acted in support of militant Kashmiris fighting against Indian control of the Himalayan territory .
They fled the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday , leaving the airport with three Kashmiri militants who had been released from Indian jails in a deal to free the hostages .
Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban militia gave the hijackers 10 hours to get out of the country .
They remained out of sight Sunday , while India and Pakistan feuded over their identities and their whereabouts .
India claims the five are Pakistani citizens who crossed back into their homeland from Afghanistan , and were near the southwestern city of Quetta .
`` We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani and the list of militants they wanted to be released contained majority of Pakistani nationals , '' said Mishra .
But Pakistan said the men were not Pakistani nationals , had not set foot on its territory , and would be apprehended if they did turn up .
`` Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan , '' said the country 's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider .
He said Pakistan was on `` high alert '' to prevent the hijackers from slipping across the border .
Mishra claimed that in one of the messages intercepted by New Delhi -- a discussion between members of two different separatist organizations -- one man asked why the other had condemned the hijacking , saying that the hijackers were acting on the instructions of Pakistan .
Mishra also said that an alleged refusal by Pakistan to accept some of the sick and injured passengers when the plane temporarily landed at Lahore , indicated Islamabad complicity in the crisis .
`` It is clear that Pakistan is showing enmity , '' said Mishra , who is also Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's principal secretary .
`` As long as this enmity continues there can be no talks between us . ''
Armed with grenades , pistols and knives , hijackers seized Flight 814 some 40 minutes after it took off from Katmandu , Nepal , on a scheduled flight to New Delhi , India , on Christmas Eve .
The plane made stops in India , Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates before landing in Afghanistan the next day .
The plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members when it took off from Nepal .
Twenty -seven hostages and the body of the slain man were unloaded in the Emirates .
