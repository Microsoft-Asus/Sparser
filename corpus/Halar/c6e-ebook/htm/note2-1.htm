Mass is the amount of matter in an object, whereas the weight of an object is how strongly that mass is pulled by gravity. An astronaut in orbit in a space shuttle is weightless, but the astronaut’s mass is the same as it would be on Earth. However, as long as we are earthbound, the weight of an object is a measure of its mass; so we can use the terms interchangeably.</body></html>
