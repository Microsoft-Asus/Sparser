BEIJING --
A new Chinese policy paper on Taiwan , which has prompted a furious reaction in the United States , merely `` reiterates the government 's consistent stance '' and does not represent a change in policy , a senior Chinese official said Tuesday .
`` Some foreign media have regarded China as making a major change to its policy on solving the Taiwan issue , '' state television quoted Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen as saying on Tuesday evening .
`` This view is incorrect . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A `` white paper '' issued last week by the State Council , China 's cabinet , declared that China would be forced to take `` all drastic measures , '' including military force , under three conditions : if Taiwan declared independence , if it was invaded by foreign troops , or if Taiwan 's government refused `` indefinitely '' to make progress on the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland .</ENAMEX>
Although the third condition had long been implicit in China 's policy toward Taiwan , which Beijing views as a breakaway province , it had never been so explicitly stated .
With Taiwan 's presidential election just a few weeks away , the stark inclusion of this third condition in the document was interpreted in Taiwan and by many Western politicians as a new direct military threat .
In Washington , members of both the administration and Congress were caught off-guard by the policy paper , and many reacted swiftly and harshly to the new clause .
Some U.S. foreign policy analysts said that the potential for a crisis in the Taiwan Straits was now `` very high . ''
Lawmakers said they would now consider arms sales to Taiwan with a new urgency , and a congressional vote that is needed to help usher China into the World Trade Organization suddenly seemed in jeopardy .
But China 's leaders seemed equally taken by surprised at the passion of the U.S. response .
In the past week , Chinese officials have said in private that the ultimatums in the paper were not new and were , in fact , intended to encourage a peaceful settlement to the Taiwan issue .
And ordinary Chinese paid the policy paper little heed .
A number noted that it set no deadline for talks on reunification .
`` Of course they said they might use force -- they have to say this -- but it does n't mean they will , '' said a industrial relations major at People 's University in Beijing , who gave only his surname , Zhang .
`` They 're just trying to influence Taiwan 's elections . ''
The paper 's warning against delaying reunification talks is , at least , a sign of China 's growing impatience with Taiwan , which has so far been far more interested in negotiating business ties than reunification .
In recent speeches , President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders have repeatedly said that reunification with Taiwan is a top priority , now that Hong Kong and Macau have both been absorbed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Still , despite such statements , the mood in China is more relaxed than in 1996 , in the weeks before Taiwan 's last presidential election , when China lobbed missiles near Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
U.S. warships steamed into the region in a show of support .
Instead , this week , the head of the U.S. Pacific Command , Adm. Dennis Blair , was in Beijing for a previously scheduled visit with Defense Minister Chi Haotian and top Chinese military officials .
While Chi told Blair that China would `` never commit not to use force , '' the New China News Agency reported , he also stressed that Beijing was `` committed to peaceful reunification with Taiwan . ''
