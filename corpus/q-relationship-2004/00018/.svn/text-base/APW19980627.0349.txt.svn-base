SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
North Korea on Saturday blamed South Korea for the death of nine crewmen of a submarine captured in the South 's waters , and demanded the return the vessel and the bodies of the crew .
The North Korean submarine , suspected of espionage , was found tangled in a South Korean fishing net Monday .
When it was towed ashore and searched Friday , South Korean navy commandoes found nine bodies inside , all shot apparently to avoid capture .
On Saturday , North Korea said South Korea should have rescued its submarine , which it said went adrift after developing mechanical troubles during a training mission .
`` The South Korean authorities should be held responsible for the death of the crewmen because they did not save them in time , '' said the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland , a North Korean government agency in charge of relations with the rival South .
`` We also wonder how the crewmen died , '' said the committee 's statement carried by the North 's official Korean Central News Agency .

The 70-ton , Yugo -clas submarine was first found by South Korean sardine fishermen Monday , with its periscope and propeller caught in a fishing net .
Three crewmen were on the deck struggling to free their craft but disappeared inside when they saw the fishermen .
South Korean navy sailors said they tried to communicate but the North Korean crew did not respond .
It took the navy three days to tow the badly listing submarine to a port .
At one point it dropped the craft to the sea bottom .
Officials had earlier indicated that they would return the dead North Koreans , but not the submarine , which could contain precious military data .
The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 .
They are still technically at war , since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty .
President Kim Dae -jung denounced the intrusion but said the incident would not sway his policy of expanding exchanges and cooperation in an effort to open up the communist North 's closed society .
Also Saturday , South Korea said it found more evidence that the submarine was on a spying mission .
The submarine left its North Korean base in Wonsan , a major east coast port 100 kilometers -LRB- 62 miles -RRB- north of the North - South border on June 20 , Defense Ministry officials said , quoting the sub 's logbook .
The submarine arrived off Yangyang , a South Korean port 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- south of the border the following day , which was last Sunday , and `` executed the mission '' around midnight , the officials said .
They suspect that the vessel was returning north after onshore espionage or dropping or picking up spies .
