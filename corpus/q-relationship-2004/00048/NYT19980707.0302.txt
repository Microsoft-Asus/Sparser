WASHINGTON --
In a small concession to the American software and financial industries , the Clinton administration announced Tuesday that it would for the first time allow the export of strong data-scrambling software without any promises of back-door access for law enforcement -- but only for banks and financial institutions in 45 nations that have acceptable money-laundering laws .
The announcement marks a victory of sorts for a faction within the administration that favors unrestrained encryption as a way of protecting personal privacy and encouraging the growth of the Internet as an engine of new electronic commerce .
Another faction backs FBI director Louis Freeh , who has demanded that police agencies be given software `` keys '' that could , with a court order , unlock scrambled messages , much as they can now get permission to tap a telephone .
But the announcement represented only a small step in what has for the last year been a deadlock in negotiations between the government and the software industry .
The industry argues that foreign software makers will get the upper hand if American companies are not allowed to export strong encryption -- that is , software that scrambles data so thoroughly that it would require a supercomputer and at least several weeks to decipher , if the code could be cracked at all .
Commerce Secretary William Daley announced the new guidelines in a speech to an exporters conference here .
He presented the change in the rules as an expansion of last year 's decision to allow special treatment for encryption products that are used to secure financial communications and transactions .
At the same time , while admitting that current export controls are stifling the ability of American companies to compete globally , Daley said that the administration was still at least months away from reaching any consensus on the broader issues of encryption policy .
Companies that make software for financial institutions were pleased by the announcement .

`` As the world 's largest exporter of security solutions to international banks and financial institutions , we have been urging such a shift for some time , and this seems to be a key step in that direction . ''</ENAMEX>
But a coalition of software companies , privacy groups and others fighting for an across-the-board lifting of export controls on encryption called the policy shift insignificant .
`` We do n't support this piecemeal approach , '' said Sue Richards , a spokeswoman for Americans for Computer Privacy .
`` We support the lifting of all export restrictions . ''
American companies now must get a permit from the Commerce Department to export anything but the most rudimentary encryption products .
To qualify , companies must have a plan for creating law-enforcement keys .
In May 1997 , the Commerce Department 's Bureau of Export Administration announced that it would ease the restrictions on products used by financial institutions .
But it still required that companies exporting strong encryption have a plan for developing law-enforcement keys , and export licenses are issued on a case-by-case basis .
Under the new rules , which are expected to take effect later this summer , the Commerce Department has done away with the spare key and licensing requirements , meaning that the products will only need a one-time review before they can be exported to financial institutions that have their headquarters in any of the 45 qualifying nations .
Eligible countries are either members of an international anti-money-laundering accord or have enacted anti-money-laundering laws .
Once they receive approval , the institutions will be allowed to share the technology with branches worldwide , except with those in terrorist states .
`` This action gives our nation 's financial institutions the flexibility they need to remain globally competitive , '' Daley said .
`` Importantly , it balances those needs with law enforcement , national security and foreign policy concerns .
Through steps like this we can continue to encourage the development of an electronic commerce system users can trust . ''
In April , Daley conceded that the administration 's attempts to control encryption had failed , and he chastised both the FBI and the software industry for refusing to compromise .
Since then , there has been some progress , according to Daley .
`` There 's certainly been more discussion and movement and understanding than there surely was in April , '' he said .
Others involved in the negotiations , however , said that little progress had been made .
Several bills pending in Congress would lift the export controls and ban any attempts to require law enforcement keys .
The administration 's encryption policy has also been the subject of several lawsuits by college professors who have been restricted from posting encryption codes on the Internet as part of their course tools .
And decisions in those cases are as divided as the administration and the software industry .
On Friday , a federal judge in Ohio ruled against a professor at Case Western Reserve University Law School , who argued that the posting of his programs was protected by the First Amendment .
That ruling contradicts one earlier this year by a federal judge in California , who ruled in the case of a University of Illinois math professor that computer source code is protected by the First Amendment .
