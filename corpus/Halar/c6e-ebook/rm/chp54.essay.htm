									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">Some biologists, struck by the complex interdependence of biotic and abiotic factors that make up ecosystems, have suggested that ecosystems themselves are emergent, "living" systems capable of evolving. One manifestation of this is James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, which views Earth itself as a living, homeostatic entity--a kind of superorganism. Critique the idea that ecosystems and the biosphere can evolve by applying the principles of evolution you have learned in this book. If ecosystems are capable of evolving, is this a form of Darwinian evolution? Why or why not?</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">The amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the atmosphere is increasing, and global temperature has increased over the past century; however, scientists do not agree about the extent to which the two phenomena are related. Most say that greenhouse warming is under way and we need to take action now to avoid drastic environmental change. Some say it is too soon to tell and we should gather more data before we act. What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing something now to slow global warming? What are the advantages and disadvantages of waiting until more data are available?</p>
