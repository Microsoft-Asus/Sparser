When Darwin saw that the geologically young Gal&aacute;pagos Islands had already become populated with many plants and animals known nowhere else in the world, he realized that he was visiting a place of genesis. The islands are named for the giant tortoises, such as the Geochelone elephantopus shown above, that are among the unique inhabitants. (Gal&aacute;pago is the Spanish word for tortoise.) After visiting the Gal&aacute;pagos, Darwin wrote in his diary: "Both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact--that mystery of mysteries--the first appearance of new beings on this Earth." The beginning of new forms of life--the origin of species--is at the focal point of evolutionary theory, for it is in new species that biological diversity arises. It is not enough to explain how adaptations evolve in populations, a topic covered in Chapter 23. Evolutionary theory must also explain macroevolution, the origin of new taxonomic groups (new species, new genera, new families, even new kingdoms). Speciation (the origin of new species) is the key process because any genus, family, or higher taxon originates with a new species that is novel enough to be the inaugural member of the higher taxon.

The fossil record chronicles two patterns of speciation: anagenesis and cladogenesis (FIGURE 24.1). Anagenesis (from the Greek ana, up, and genesis, origin), also known as phyletic evolution, is the accumulation of changes associated with the transformation of one species into another. Cladogenesis (from the Greek clados, branch), also called branching evolution, is the budding of one or more new species from a parent species that continues to exist. Only cladogenesis can promote biological diversity by increasing the number of species.

(b) Cladogenesis is branching evolution, in which a new species arises from a population that buds from a parent species. Cladogenesis is the basis for biological diversity.

Our objectives in this chapter are to evaluate definitions of species and mechanisms of speciation and to examine the possible origins of some novel features that define higher taxonomic groups. Our first step is to appraise the assumption that species actually exist in nature as discrete biological units distinct from all others.

 Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species



Species is a Latin word meaning "kind" or "appearance." Indeed, we learn to distinguish between the kinds of plants or animals--between dogs and cats, for instance--from differences in their appearance. In addition to comparing morphology (body form), modern taxonomists also consider differences in body functions, biochemistry, behavior, and genetic makeup. However, dividing organisms into different species based on comparative data is only part of an extensive effort to better understand the nature of species and the factors that maintain their distinctiveness in nature.





MODES OF SPECIATION

 

 Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species



 

 Sympatric speciation: A new species can originate in the geographic midst of the parent species



 

 The punctuated equilibrium model has stimulated research on thetempo of speciation



There are two general modes of speciation based on how gene flow among populations is initially interrupted (FIGURE 24.6). In a speciation mode termed allopatric speciation (from the Greek allos, other, and from the Latin patria, homeland), speciation takes place in populations with geographically separate ranges. Gene flow is initially interrupted or reduced between two populations because they are separated in space. In the second speciation mode, called sympatric speciation (from the Greek sym, together), speciation takes place in geographically overlapping populations. Here biological factors, such as chromosomal changes and nonrandom mating, reduce gene flow.

 An evolutionary trend does not mean that evolution is goal oriented



Speciation is at the boundary between microevolution and macroevolution. Microevolution is a change over the generations in a population's allele frequencies, mainly by genetic drift and natural selection. Speciation occurs when a population's genetic divergence from its ancestral population results in reproductive isolation. The change in morphology during that divergence may be very conspicuous when we compare two closely related species, but usually the differences are more subtle, such as the color difference between the two cichlid species in FIGURE 24.16. Yet the cumulative change during millions of speciation episodes over vast tracts of time must account for macroevolution, the level of change that is evident over the time scale of the fossil record. How, for example, did feathers and other flight equipment evolve during the descent of birds from reptiles? Put more generally, how do the evolutionary novelties that define taxonomic groups above the species level, such as classes and phyla, evolve? In this last section, we look at some of the mechanisms behind macroevolution.





 The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation

A classical species definition known as the biological species concept was first enunciated by evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1942. Mayr's definition addresses the question, What factors divide biological diversity into separate forms that we identify as species?

The biological species concept defines a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed with one another in nature to produce viable, fertile offspring, but who cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other species (FIGURE 24.2). In other words, a biological species is the largest set of populations in which genetic exchange is possible and that is genetically isolated from other such populations. Members of a biological species are united by being reproductively compatible, at least potentially. A businesswoman in Manhattan has little probability of producing offspring with a dairyman in Mongolia, but if the two should get together, they could have viable babies that develop into fertile adults. All humans belong to the same biological species. In contrast, humans and chimpanzees remain distinct biological species even where they share territory, because the two species do not interbreed. Thus, the biological species concept hinges on reproductive isolation, with each species isolated by factors (barriers) that prevent interbreeding, thereby blocking genetic mixing with other species.

 Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers isolate the gene pools of biological species

Any factor that impedes two species from producing viable, fertile hybrids contributes to reproductive isolation. No single barrier may be completely impenetrable to genetic exchange, but many species are genetically sequestered by more than one type of barrier. Here, we are considering only biological barriers to reproduction, which are intrinsic to the organisms. Of course, if two species are geographically segregated, they cannot possibly interbreed, but a geographic barrier is not what biologists mean by reproductive isolation because it is not intrinsic to the organisms themselves. Reproductive isolation prevents populations belonging to different species from interbreeding, even if their ranges overlap.

Clearly, a fly will not mate with a frog or a fern, but what prevents biological species that are very similar--that is, closely related--from interbreeding? The various reproductive barriers that isolate the gene pools of species can be categorized as prezygotic or postzygotic, depending on whether they function before or after the formation of zygotes, or fertilized eggs.

Prezygotic Barriers

Prezygotic barriers impede mating between species or hinder the fertilization of ova if members of different species attempt to mate.

Habitat Isolation.Two species that live in different habitats within the same area may encounter each other rarely, if at all, even though they are not technically geographically isolated. For example, two species of garter snakes in the genus Thamnophis occur in the same areas, but one lives mainly in water and the other is primarily terrestrial. Habitat isolation also affects parasites, which are generally confined to certain plant or animal host species. Two species of parasites living on different hosts will not have a chance to mate.

Behavioral Isolation.Special signals that attract mates, as well as elaborate behavior unique to a species, are probably the most important reproductive barriers among closely related animals. Male fireflies of various species signal to females of their kind by blinking their lights in particular rhythms. The females respond only to signals characteristic of their own species, flashing back and attracting the males. The eastern and western meadowlarks shown in FIGURE 24.2a are almost identical in shape, coloration, and habitat, and their ranges overlap in the central United States. Yet they remain two separate biological species, partly because of the differences in their songs, which enable them to recognize individuals of their own kind. Behavioral isolation often depends on the elaborate courtship rituals of a particular species (FIGURE 24.3).

Fig 24-3. Courtship ritual as a behavioral barrier between species. These blue-footed boobies, inhabitants of the Gal&aacute;pagos, will mate only after a specific ritual of courtship displays. Part of the "script" calls for the male to high-step, a behavior that advertises the bright blue feet characteristic of the species.

Temporal Isolation.Two species that breed during different times of the day, different seasons, or different years cannot mix their gametes. The geographic ranges of the western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) and the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) overlap, but these two very similar species do not interbreed because S. gracilis mates in late summer and S. putorius mates in late winter. Three species of the orchid genus Dendrobium living in the same rain forest do not hybridize because they flower on different days. Pollination of each species is limited to a single day because the flowers open in the morning and wither that evening.

Mechanical Isolation.Closely related species may attempt to mate but fail to consummate the act because they are anatomically incompatible. For example, mechanical barriers contribute to reproductive isolation of flowering plants that are pollinated by insects or other animals. Floral anatomy is often adapted to certain pollinators that transfer pollen only among plants of the same species. In another example of mechanical isolation, if insects of closely related species attempt to mate, the male and female copulatory organs may not fit together and no sperm would be transferred.

Gametic Isolation.Even if the gametes of different species meet, they rarely fuse to form a zygote. For animals whose eggs are fertilized within the female reproductive tract (internal fertilization), the sperm of one species may not be able to survive in the environment of the female reproductive tract of another species. Many aquatic animals release their gametes into the surrounding water, where the eggs are fertilized (external fertilization). Even when two closely related species release their gametes at the same time in the same place, cross-specific fertilization is uncommon. Gamete recognition may be based on the presence of specific molecules on the coats around the egg, which adhere only to complementary molecules on sperm cells of the same species. A similar mechanism of molecular recognition enables a flower to discriminate between pollen of the same species and pollen of different species.

Postzygotic Barriers

If a sperm cell from one species does fertilize an ovum of another species, then postzygotic barriers usually prevent the hybrid zygote from developing into a viable, fertile adult.

Reduced Hybrid Viability.When prezygotic barriers are crossed and hybrid zygotes are formed, genetic incompatibility between the two species may abort development of the hybrid at some embryonic stage. Of the numerous species of frogs belonging to the genus Rana, some live in the same regions and habitats, where they may occasionally hybridize. But the hybrids generally do not complete development, and those that do are frail.

Reduced Hybrid Fertility.Even if two species mate and produce hybrid offspring that are vigorous, reproductive isolation is intact if the hybrids are completely or largely sterile. Since the infertile hybrid cannot backbreed with either parental species, genes cannot flow freely between the species. One cause of this barrier is a failure of meiosis to produce normal gametes in the hybrid if chromosomes of the two parent species differ in number or structure. A familiar case of a sterile hybrid is the mule, a robust cross between a horse and a donkey; horses and donkeys remain distinct species because, except very rarely, mules cannot backbreed with either species (FIGURE 24.4).

Fig 24-4. Hybrid sterility, a postzygotic barrier. Horses and donkeys remain separate species because their hybrid offspring, mules, are sterile.

Hybrid Breakdown.In some cases when species cross-mate, the first-generation hybrids are viable and fertile, but when these hybrids mate with one another or with either parent species, offspring of the next generation are feeble or sterile. For example, different cotton species can produce fertile hybrids, but breakdown occurs in the next generation when offspring of the hybrids die as seeds or grow into weak and defective plants.

 The biological species concept hassome major limitations

In its emphasis on reproductive barriers as the boundaries between species, the biological species concept has had an important impact on evolutionary theory and how we think of species as discrete forms of life. However, as a criterion for actually distinguishing species in nature, the biological species concept does not work in all situations and is in fact impractical for demarcating species in most cases. For example, there is no way to check interbreeding in the extinct forms represented by fossils. Biologists classify fossils into species based on differences in morphology. Even most living species are distinguished by comparative morphology because we lack the information about interbreeding necessary to apply the biological species concept as the criterion. The biological species concept also has no utility at all for life-forms that are entirely asexual, such as bacteria. (Many bacteria do transfer genes by conjugation and other processes--see Chapter 18--but there is nothing akin to the sexual union of gametes from two parents.) Biologists assign asexual organisms to species based mainly on structural and biochemical characteristics.





 Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species

The biological species concept emphasizes a separateness of different species due to reproductive barriers. In contrast, several alternative species concepts emphasize the processes that unite the members of a species. The distinction is analogous to defining a country not by the borders that separate it from other countries but by the set of cultural features that give the country an identity.

The ecological species concept defines a species in terms of its ecological niche, the set of environmental resources a species uses. Put another way, a species' niche depends on its unique adaptations to a particular role in a biological community. (We will examine the concept of ecological niche in more detail in Chapter 53.) For example, a species that is a parasite may be defined in part by its adaptations to a specific host organism. Note that this species concept accommodates asexual species, which the biological species concept does not.

According to a pluralistic species concept, the factors that are most important for the cohesion of individuals as a species vary. In some cases, reproductive isolation may be a key unifying factor for a species. In other cases, adaptation to a specific ecological niche may be the main factor in species cohesion. In still other cases, the integrity of the species may depend on some combination of reproductive isolation and a unique niche.

The biological, ecological, and pluralistic species concepts are all "explanatory" concepts--attempts to explain the very existence of species as discrete units in the diversity of life. None, however, is especially useful in actually identifying various species in nature. For that, taxonomists still depend mainly on morphological characteristics. Thus, although it doesn't really explain why species exist, the morphological species concept, which characterizes each species in terms of a unique set of structural features, remains the way we distinguish most species.

Many evolutionary biologists are also evaluating a genealogical species concept, which defines a species as a set of organisms with a unique genetic history--that is, as one tip on the branching tree of life. The sequencing of nucleic acids and proteins provides data that researchers are now using to define each species in terms of unique genetic markers. Like the morphological species concept, the genealogical one is more concerned with identifying the various species than with a theoretical explanation for their existence as separate forms of life.

Each species concept has utility, depending on the situation and the types of questions we are asking. The biological species concept, in its emphasis on reproductive barriers to gene flow, is particularly useful in thinking about how species originate. Next, we examine the processes that can lead to such speciation.





 Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species

Conditions for Allopatric Speciation

Several geologic processes can fragment a population into two or more isolated populations. A mountain range may emerge and gradually split a population of organisms that can inhabit only lowlands. A land bridge, such as the Isthmus of Panama, may form and separate the marine life on either side. A large lake may subside until there are several smaller lakes with their populations now isolated. Even without such geologic remodeling, geographic isolation and allopatric speciation can occur if individuals colonize a new, geographically remote area and become isolated from the parent population. An example is the speciation that occurred on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands following colonization by mainland organisms.

How formidable must a geographic barrier be to keep allopatric populations apart? The answer depends on the ability of the organisms to move about. Birds, mountain lions, and coyotes can cross mountain ranges, rivers, and canyons. Nor do such barriers hinder the windblown pollen of pine trees, and the seeds of many plants may be carried back and forth on animals. In contrast, small rodents may find a deep canyon or a wide river a formidable barrier (FIGURE 24.7).

Fig 24-7. Allopatric speciation of squirrels in the Grand Canyon. Two species of antelope squirrels inhabit opposite rims of the Grand Canyon. On the south rim is Harris's antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus harrisi). Just a few miles away on the north rim is the closely related white-tailed antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilis leucurus). Birds and other organisms that can disperse easily across the canyon have not diverged into different species on opposite rims.

The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is both small and isolated. A small, isolated population is more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially by genetic drift and natural selection. For example, in less than 2 million years, small populations of stray animals and plants from the South American mainland that managed to colonize the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands gave rise to all the new species that now inhabit the islands. But for each small, isolated population that becomes a new species, many more simply perish in their new environment. Life on the frontier is harsh, and most pioneer populations probably become extinct.

A key question about allopatric populations is whether they have become different enough that they can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring if they come back into contact (FIGURE 24.8). In some cases, researchers evaluate whether speciation has occurred by artificially bringing together members of separated populations in a laboratory setting. In other cases, biologists can investigate allopatric speciation where separated populations have come back into contact naturally.

Ring Species: Allopatric Speciation in Progress?

Some species have geographic distributions that provide evolutionary biologists with examples of what seem to be populations at various stages in their gradual divergence from common ancestors. Consider a so-called ring species, which is distributed around some geographic barrier, with the populations that have diverged the most in their evolution eventually meeting where the ring closes. FIGURE 24.9 illustrates populations of a North American salamander, Ensatina eschscholtzii. The species probably expanded southward into California from Oregon. The California population eventually split into a coastal population and an inland one, giving rise to two separate chains of interbreeding populations. One chain extends down the coastal mountains and one extends down the inland mountains (Sierra Nevada range). The dual chains of salamander populations gradually formed a ring around California's central valley (the San Joaquin Valley). Salamanders of the different populations contrast in coloration, and researchers have demonstrated that the coastal and inland populations exhibit more and more genetic differences the farther south the comparison is made.

Fig 24-9. Ensatina eschscholtzii, a ring species. The gap in the ring in southern California indicates that researchers have not yet collected salamanders in that desert location, but genetic analysis indicates a close relationship between the large-blotched salamander and inland populations at the southern end of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

In the northern and middle portions of the ring, the salamander populations interbreed as a single species (as defined by the biological species concept). About halfway down the ring, the coastal and inland gene pools occasionally "leak" across the central valley as members of the two populations interbreed. But near the ring's southern end in San Diego County, no hybridization occurs in some of the locales where the ranges of coastal and inland populations overlap. Based on the criterion of reproductive isolation, it is legitimate to designate the two southern populations as separate species.

Adaptive Radiation on Island Chains

Islands are living laboratories for the study of speciation. Flurries of allopatric speciation have occurred on island chains where organisms that have strayed or become passively dispersed from their parent populations have founded new populations that evolved in isolation (FIGURE 24.10). The many indigenous species of the Gal&aacute;pagos descended from stragglers that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland. For example, consider the Gal&aacute;pagos finches. A single dispersal event may have seeded one island with a small population of the ancestral finch, which gave rise to a new species. Later, a few individuals of this island species may have reached neighboring islands, where geographic isolation permitted additional speciation episodes. After diverging on one of these other islands, a new species could recolonize the island from which its founding population emigrated and coexist there with its parent species or form still another species. Multiple colonizations by species from neighboring islands would eventually lead to the coexistence of several species on each island. The islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough together for occasional dispersion events to occur. Such evolution of many diversely adapted species from a common ancestor is called adaptive radiation (FIGURE 24.11).

Fig 24-11. A model for adaptive radiation on island chains.

The Hawaiian Archipelago is one of the world's great showcases of evolution (see FIGURE 22.16). The volcanic islands are about 3,500 km from the nearest continent. They become progressively younger to the southeast, terminating with the youngest and largest island, Hawaii, which is less than a million years old and still has active volcanoes. Each island was born naked and was gradually populated by species derived from strays that rode the ocean currents and winds either from distant islands and continents or from older islands of the archipelago itself. The physical diversity of each island, including a range of altitudes and extensive differences in rainfall, provides many environmental opportunities for evolutionary divergence by natural selection. Multiple invasions and allopatric speciations have ignited an explosion of adaptive radiation; most of the thousands of species of plants and animals that now inhabit the islands are found nowhere else in the world. In contrast, there are no indigenous species on the Florida Keys. Apparently, those islands are so close to the mainland that founding populations are not sufficiently sequestered for their gene pools to become isolated from the steady stream of immigrants from the parent populations on the mainland.

How Do Reproductive Barriers Evolve?

This is a good time to address two potential misunderstandings about allopatric speciation. First, it is important to understand that geographic isolation, while obviously preventing interbreeding between allopatric populations, does not qualify as reproductive isolation in the biological sense. The reproductive barriers relevant to the biological species concept are intrinsic to the organisms themselves and prevent interbreeding even in the absence of geographic isolation (see FIGURE 24.5 to review reproductive barriers). Second, it is important to realize that speciation is not due to some drive to erect reproductive barriers around a population. In most cases, reproductive barriers are probably coincidental to changes in gene pools due to natural selection and genetic drift as allopatric populations evolve separately. Let's examine a couple of examples.

Example of Evolution of a Prezygotic Barrier. Diane Dodd, of Yale University, designed laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that reproductive barriers between allopatric populations can evolve as a by-product of the populations' adaptive divergence in different environments. She divided a sample of fruit flies (Drosophila pseudoobscura) into several laboratory populations that were then cultured for several generations on different nutrient sources. Some populations were nourished with a starch medium, while others were nourished with a maltose (malt sugar) medium (FIGURE 24.12). Acting over several generations, natural selection favored those individuals that were best suited to the available nutrient; populations reared on starch improved in their efficiency at starch digestion, while the "maltose" populations improved in their efficiency at malt sugar digestion.

Fig 24-12. Evolution of reproductive isolation in lab populations of Drosophila.

After the two types of fly populations diverged in their evolution for several generations, Dodd combined flies from various populations in mate-choice experiments. Female "maltose flies" were more likely to mate with male maltose flies than with male "starch flies," even if the maltose flies came from a different maltose fly population. The female starch flies also seemed to discriminate in favor of other starch flies as mates. This is an example of a prezygotic barrier--in this case, a behavioral obstacle to interbreeding. The reproductive barrier was not absolute--some mating between maltose flies and starch flies did occur--but reproductive isolation was apparently well under way after several generations of evolutionary divergence.

Why would a reproductive barrier between two populations be a consequence of their divergent adaptation to different environments? Specifically, how could adaptation to a certain diet affect mate choice? One hypothesis is based on pleiotropy, where one allele has multiple effects on phenotype--in this case affecting both nutrient digestion and mate choice (see Chapter 14). Mating in fruit flies follows an elaborate courtship ritual that includes a song produced by the buzzing of the wings, a dance with specific "steps," and detection of specific odors emitted from the potential mate's cuticle, the hard covering of insects. Perhaps the same allele(s) that enhances digestion of a certain carbohydrate also affects the chemical composition of the cuticle and determines which of these "bouquet" molecules function in mate recognition. How could you test this hypothesis?

Example of Evolution of a Postzygotic Barrier.Robert Vickery, of the University of Utah, tested the ability of plants from different populations of monkey flower (Mimulus glabratus) to interbreed. (The plant is named for its flower, which resembles a monkey's face.) The species has a very large range that extends throughout the Americas. Vickery imported Mimulus plants from different regions and cross-pollinated them in his greenhouse. He then planted the seeds of the hybrids to see if they developed into fertile plants. Most of the offspring were fertile when the cross was between plants from nearby populations--say, between Wisconsin and Michigan Mimulus. But the proportion of fertile offspring dropped off when Vickery crossed plants from more distant populations. In fact, the offspring of hybrids from crosses between plants from Wisconsin and Mexico were almost all sterile. Note that this is a postzygotic barrier (hybrid breakdown; see FIGURE 24.5).

Again, it is important to dispel the notion that such a reproductive barrier evolves because of some kind of drive toward speciation. In fact, natural selection probably maintains reproductive compatibility between neighboring Mimulus populations because hybridization between these populations occurs often enough in nature that alleles hampering reproductive success of the hybrids would be eliminated from the gene pool. But a Wisconsin monkey flower would never hybridize naturally with one from Mexico, and thus there is no selection pressure keeping the genomes of such distant populations compatible enough for successful interbreeding. It's not that selection favors a reproductive barrier between allopatric populations, but that there is no longer any advantage to the absence of such barriers.

Summary of Allopatric Speciation

In allopatric speciation, a new species forms while geographically isolated from its ancestor. As the isolated population's gene pool evolves by genetic drift and natural selection, reproductive isolation from the ancestral species may evolve as a by-product of the genetic change. Such reproductive barriers prevent interbreeding with the ancestor, even if the populations come back into contact. We have examined four examples of how biologists are dissecting the process of allopatric speciation: the evolutionary divergence of populations of a ring species (the salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii); the adaptive radiation of island species; the origin of a prezygotic barrier to interbreeding in lab populations of the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura; and the origin of a postzygotic barrier between distant populations of the monkey flower Mimulus glabratus. Let's turn next to mechanisms that can produce a new species without geographic isolation from its ancestor.





 Sympatric speciation: A new species can originate in the geographic midst of the parent species

In sympatric speciation, new species arise within the range of parent populations rather than in geographically separate populations (see FIGURE 24.6b). How can reproductive barriers between sympatric populations evolve? Let's examine examples in both the plant and animal kingdoms.

Polyploid Speciation in Plants

Some plant species have their origins in accidents during cell division that result in extra sets of chromosomes, a mutant condition called polyploidy. An autopolyploid (from the Greek autos, self) is an individual that has more than two chromosome sets, all derived from a single species. For example, a failure of meiosis during gamete production can double chromosome number from the diploid count (2n) to a tetraploid number (4n) (FIGURE 24.13). The tetraploid can then fertilize itself (self-pollinate) or mate with other tetraploids. However, the mutants cannot interbreed successfully with diploid plants of the original population; the offspring, which would be triploid (3n), would be sterile because unpaired chromosomes result in abnormal meiosis. In just one generation, a postzygotic barrier has caused reproductive isolation and has interrupted gene flow between a tiny population of tetraploids (maybe only a single plant initially) and the parent diploid population that surrounds it. Sympatric speciation by autopolyploidy was first discovered in the early 1900s by geneticist Hugo de Vries when his experiments produced a new species of evening primrose (FIGURE 24.14, p. 474).

Fig 24-14. Botanist Hugo de Vries and his new primrose species. Working in the early 1900s, de Vries studied variation in evening primroses. In his breeding experiments with Oenothera lamarckiana (lower left), a diploid species of primrose with 14 chromosomes, he produced a new variety with 28 chromosomes. It was a tetraploid, which could not interbreed with its parent species. De Vries named the new primrose species Oenothera gigas, for its large size (upper right).

Another type of polyploid species, much more common than autopolyploids, is called an allopolyploid, referring to the contribution of two different species to a polyploid hybrid. The origin of an allopolyploid begins when two different species interbreed and combine their chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids are usually sterile because the haploid set of chromosomes from one species cannot pair during meiosis with the haploid set from the other species. Though infertile, a hybrid may actually be more vigorous than its parents and propagate itself asexually (which many plants can do). Various mechanisms can then change a sterile hybrid into a fertile polyploid (FIGURE 24.15 on p. 474 illustrates one such mechanism). The polyploid hybrids are fertile with each other but cannot interbreed with either parental species.

Fig 24-15. One mechanism for allopolyploid speciation in plants. A hybrid between two species is normally sterile because its chromosomes are not homologous and cannot pair during meiosis. However, the hybrids may be able to reproduce asexually. This diagram traces one mechanism that can produce fertile hybrids as new polyploid species. The new species has a chromosome number equal to the sum of the chromosomes in the two parent species.

The origin of new polyploid plant species is common enough and rapid enough that scientists have documented several such speciations. For example, two new species of plants called goatsbeards originated in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1900s. The goatsbeard genus, Tragopogon, is native to Europe, but three species were introduced by humans to the Americas in the early 1900s. These species, T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius, are now common weeds in urban wastelands such as abandoned parking lots. In the 1950s, botanists identified two new species of Tragopogon in regions of Idaho and eastern Washington where all three European species are also found. One new species, T. miscellus, is a tetraploid hybrid of T. dubius and T. pratensis; the other new species, T. mirus, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors are T. dubius and T. porrifolius. While the T. mirus population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, additional episodes of hybridization between the ancestral species also add to the T. mirus population. This is an ongoing speciation process we can observe today.

Many of the plants we grow for food are polyploids. Oats, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, and wheat are among the polyploid species important to agriculture. The wheat used for bread, Triticum aestivum, is an allopolyploid that probably originated about 8,000 years ago as a spontaneous hybrid of a cultivated wheat and a wild grass. Plant geneticists now hybridize plants and use chemicals that induce meiotic and mitotic errors to help create new polyploids with special qualities. For example, artificial hybrids combine the high yield of wheat with the ability of rye to resist disease.

Sympatric Speciation in Animals

Although polyploid speciation is less common in animals than in plants, it does occur. However, there are other mechanisms that can lead to sympatric speciation in animals. For example, animals may become reproductively isolated within the geographic range of a parent population if genetic factors cause them to become dependent on resources not used by the parent population. Consider, for example, the wasps that pollinate figs. Each fig species is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which mates and lays its eggs in the figs. A genetic change that caused wasps to select a different fig species would segregate mating individuals of this new phenotype from the parent population. This would set the stage for further evolutionary divergence.

One of Earth's hot spots of animal speciation is Lake Victoria, in East Africa. The lake, which is less than a million years old, is home to almost 200 species of closely related fishes belonging to the cichlid family. The subdivision of populations into groups specialized for exploiting different food sources and other resources in the lake is one process that probably contributed to the adaptive radiation of these fishes. But in at least some cases, nonrandom mating, in which females select males having a certain appearance, was probably a key factor in the sympatric speciation of cichlids. Consider two closely related sympatric species of cichlids that differ mainly in coloration: Pundamilia pundamilia has a blue back, and Pundamilia nyererei has a red back. It is a reasonable hypothesis that a preference for mates of like coloration functions as a behavioral barrier to interbreeding between the two species. In 1998, biologists from Holland's University of Leiden published experiments testing this hypothesis (FIGURE 24.16). In an aquarium with natural light, females of each species mated only with males of their own species. But in an aquarium illuminated with a monochromatic orange lamp, which makes the two cichlid species appear identical in color, females of each species mated indiscriminately with males of both species. The hybrids from the errant P. pundamilia &#160;X&#160; P. nyererei matings were viable and fertile. We can infer that mate choice based on coloration is the main reproductive barrier that normally keeps the gene pools of these two species separate. And we can also infer, since the genetic divergence is small enough that the species can still interbreed when the prezygotic barrier is breached, that speciation occurred relatively recently. Perhaps the ancestral population was polymorphic for coloration and divergence began with mate choice by two subsets of females preferring one or the other color of male. Sexual selection would then reinforce the color difference as females mated preferentially with males having genes for the least mistakable coloration (see Chapter 23 to review sexual selection).

Summary of Sympatric Speciation

Sympatric speciation requires the emergence of some type of reproductive barrier that isolates the gene pool of a subset of a population without geographic separation from the parent population. In plants, the mechanism that is best understood is hybridization between closely related species coupled with errors during cell division that lead to polyploid individuals that are fertile. In animals, sympatric speciation can result from some subset of a population becoming reproductively isolated because of a switch to a habitat, food source, or other resource not used by the parent population (speciation in fig-eating flies is an example); or it can result from the emergence of a rigid mating preference by females for specific male forms in a polymorphic population (as in our example of cichlid speciation).





 The punctuated equilibrium model has stimulated research on thetempo of speciation

Traditional evolutionary trees that diagram the descent of species from ancestral forms sprout branches that diverge gradually, with species evolving continuously over long spans of time (FIGURE 24.17a, p. 476). Such trees are based on the idea that big changes occur by the accumulation of many small ones. This concept extends the processes of microevolution to the divergence of species. However, paleontologists rarely find gradual transitions of fossil forms. Instead, they often observe species appearing as new forms rather suddenly (in geologic terms) in a layer of rocks, persisting essentially unchanged for their tenure on Earth, and then disappearing from the fossil record as suddenly as they appeared. Darwin was bewildered by the dearth of connecting fossils and wrote: "Although each species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is probable that the periods during which each underwent modification, though many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition."

Fig 24-17. Two models for the tempo of speciation.

We can account for the "sudden" appearances of new forms in the fossil record partly by applying the allopatric model of speciation. In allopatric speciation, a new species arises as a splinter population in a separate place from where the ancestral species lives. If the new species later extends its range into that of the ancestral species, what we see in the fossil record is the geologically sudden appearance of a new species in a locale where there are also fossils of the ancestral species, though maybe in different strata. By then, the ancestor may have been extinct (or competition from the new species could contribute to extinction). Alternatively, the new species could coexist in the same range as the ancestor. Either way, the new species does not appear in the fossil record at the site of its ancestor until it has diverged in form during its period of geographic separation.

Advocates of a model called punctuated equilibrium incorporate ideas about the tempo of speciation in their explanations of what we see in the fossil record. According to this model, species diverge in spurts of relatively rapid change, instead of slowly and gradually (FIGURE 24.17b). In other words, species undergo most of their morphological modification as they first bud from parent species and then change little, even as they give rise to additional species. The term punctuated equilibrium is derived from the idea of long periods of stasis (equilibrium) punctuated by episodes of speciation.

How can speciation in a few thousand generations, which may require several thousand years, be called an abrupt episode? The fossil record indicates that successful species last for a few million years, on average. Suppose that a particular species survives for 5 million years, but most of its morphological changes occurred during the first 50,000 years of its existence. In this case, the evolution of the species-defining characteristics was compressed into just 1%  of the lifetime of the species. On the time scale that can generally be determined in fossil strata, the species will appear suddenly in rocks of a certain age and then linger with little or no change before becoming extinct. During its formative millennia, the species may have accumulated its modifications gradually, but relative to the overall history of the species, its inception was abrupt.

Once it is acknowledged that "sudden" may be many thousands of years on the vast scale of geologic time, the debate over the rate of speciation is muted somewhat. The degree to which a species changes after its origin is another issue. If the species is adapted to an environment that stays the same, then natural selection would counter changes in the gene pool. In this view, stabilizing selection tends to hold a population in a long period of stasis (see Chapter 23).

Some gradualists retort that stasis is an illusion. Many species may continue to change after they come into existence, but in ways that cannot be detected from fossils. By necessity, paleontologists base their theories of descent almost entirely on external anatomy and skeletons. Changes in internal anatomy and physiology may go unnoticed, as would modifications in behavior.





 Most evolutionary novelties are modified versions of older structures

We can extend the Darwinian concept of "descent with modification" to account for the major morphological transformations of macroevolution. In some cases, very complex structures evolved in increments from much simpler versions that had the same basic function. For example, the human eye is a refined optical organ constructed from multiple parts that work together in forming an image and sending that visual information to the brain. Many people find it hard to believe that such complex organs could be products of gradual evolution rather than finished designs created especially for humans. If the eye needs all its parts to work, the argument goes, how could a partial eye be of any use as an evolutionary stage? The fallacy is in the starting assumption that eyes have to be this complicated to be useful to an animal. The most basic versions of eyes are just clusters of photoreceptor cells, pigmented cells sensitive to light. Only slightly more refined are the eyes of the flatworms called planarians, which have their photoreceptor cells lining cup-shaped indentations on the head. These eyecups have no lenses or other equipment for focusing images, but they do enable the animal to distinguish light from dark; planarians move away from light, a behavioral adaptation that probably reduces the risk of being eaten.

Complex eyes of various types evolved independently from simpler ones many times in the animal kingdom. For example, some mollusks (members of the invertebrate phylum Mollusca), including squids and octopuses, have eyes every bit as complex as those of humans and other vertebrates. Among living mollusks, we can find eyes ranging in complexity from clusters of photoreceptors to camera-like eyes with lenses (FIGURE 24.18). Considering the long success of many so-called "primitive" animals with simple eyecups, such as flatworms and certain mollusks, it is clear that eyecups work fine for what these animals have to do to survive and reproduce. In those animals that do have complex eyes, the organs evolved from simpler ones not in one quantum evolutionary jump, but by incremental adaptation of organs that worked and benefited their owners at each stage of this macroevolution.

(b) The slit shell mollusk Pleurotomaria has an eyecup.(c) The Nautilus eye functions like a pinhole camera (an early type of camera lacking a lens). A thick fluid in a cavity helps focus light onto the retina, a layer of photoreceptors. (d) The eye of Murex, a marine snail, has a primitive lens consisting of a mass of crystal-like cells. The cornea is a transparent region of epithelium (outer skin) that protects the eye and helps focus light. (e) The squid Loligo has a complex "camera-Light" type eye with a cornea, lens, and retina.

The evolution of the eye refined organs that retained the basic function of vision. But evolutionary novelty can also arise by the gradual refinement of existing structures for new functions. Such structures that evolve in one context but become co-opted for another function are called exaptations. This concept does not imply that a structure somehow evolves in anticipation of future use. Natural selection cannot predict the future and can only improve a structure in the context of its current utility. The lightweight, honeycombed bones of birds (see FIGURE 1.6b) are homologous to the bones of the earthbound ancestors of birds. However, honeycombed bones could not have evolved in the ancestors as an adaptation for upcoming flights. If light bones predated flight, as is clearly indicated by the fossil record, then they must have had some function on the ground. The probable ancestors of birds were relatively small, agile, bipedal dinosaurs that also would have benefited from a light frame. It is possible that winglike forelimbs and feathers, which increased the surface area of these forelimbs, were also co-opted for flight after functioning in some other capacity, such as social displays--in courtship, for example. The first flights may have been only extended hops in pursuit of prey or escape from a predator. Once flight itself became an advantage, natural selection would have remodeled feathers and wings to better fit their additional function.

Exaptation offers one explanation for how novel features can arise gradually through a series of intermediate stages, each of which has some function in the organism's current context. Harvard zoologist Karel Liem puts it this way: "Evolution is like modifying a machine while it's running."





 "Evo-devo": Genes that control development play a major role in evolution

The interface between evolutionary biology and the study of how organisms develop is called "evo-devo." This interdisciplinary research is beginning to illuminate how slight genetic divergences can become magnified into major morphological differences between species. Genes that program development control the rate, timing, and spatial pattern of changes in an organism's form as it is transfigured from a zygote into an adult.

The shape of an organism depends in part on the relative growth rates of its different parts during development. This proportioning that helps give a body its specific form is called allometric growth (from the Greek allos, other, and metron, measure). FIGURE 24.19a tracks how allometric growth alters human body proportions during development. Change these relative rates of growth even slightly, and you change the adult form substantially. For example, different allometric patterns contribute to the contrasting shapes of human and chimpanzee skulls (FIGURE 24.19b).

Fig 24-19. Allometric growth. Different growth rates for different parts of the body determine body proportions.

Evolution of morphology that arises by a modification in allometric growth is an example of heterochrony, which is evolutionary change in the rate or timing of developmental events. We can see another example of heterochrony in the evolution of salamander feet. Most salamanders are ground-dwelling, but some species live in trees. The feet of these tree-dwelling salamanders are adapted for climbing vertically rather than walking horizontally on the ground, with shorter digits and more webbing than the feet of ground-dwelling salamanders (FIGURE 24.20). The basis for this adaptation was probably selection for mutant alleles of genes controlling the timing of foot development. According to this hypothesis, the foot of the ancestral salamander grew until the products of certain regulatory genes switched off growth, resulting in a foot of a certain size. A mutation in one or more of these regulatory genes could have switched off foot growth sooner, resulting in the stunted feet of tree-dwelling salamanders. In this way, a relatively small amount of genetic change can be amplified into the substantial morphological change that marks macroevolution.

Heterochrony can also change the timing of reproductive development relative to development of somatic (nonreproductive) organs. If the rate of reproductive development accelerates compared to somatic development, the sexually mature stage of a species may retain body features that were juvenile structures in an ancestral species. This is called paedomorphosis (from the Greek paedos, child, and morphosis, formation). For example, most salamander species have a larval stage that undergoes metamorphosis to become an adult. But some species grow to adult size and become sexually mature while retaining gills and certain other larval features (FIGURE 24.21). Such an evolutionary alteration of developmental timing can produce animals that appear very different from their ancestors, even though the overall genetic change may be small.

Fig 24-21. Paedomorphosis. Some species retain as adults features that were juvenile in ancestors. This salamander is an axolotl, which grows to full size, becomes sexually mature, and reproduces while retaining certain larval (tadpole) characteristics, including gills.

In short, heterochrony affects the evolution of morphology by altering the rates of development of various body parts or by changing the timing of onset or completion of a particular part's development.

Macroevolution can also result from changes in genes that control the placement and spatial organization of body parts. For example, genes called homeotic genes determine such basic features as where a pair of wings and a pair of legs will develop on a bird or how a plant's flower parts are arranged (see Chapter 21).

The products of one class of homeotic genes called Hox genes provide positional information in an animal embryo. This information about position prompts cells to develop into structures appropriate for a particular location. Changes in Hox genes can have a profound impact on morphology. Consider, for example, the evolution of tetrapods (the terrestrial vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) from fishes, which are aquatic vertebrates. One of the major transitions in this vertebrate history was the evolution of the walking legs of tetrapods from the fins of fishes. Unlike the fish fin, the tetrapod limb has digits (fingers and toes in humans) that extend skeletal support to the tip of the limb. During the development of a tetrapod, a Hox gene is expressed at the outer edge of the limb bud, the embryonic structure that develops into a leg. The product of this Hox gene apparently provides positional information about how far outward bones should grow in the limb (FIGURE 24.22). A related Hox gene is expressed during the development of a fish fin, but in a smaller region back from the tip of the fin bud. A mutation in this Hox gene that expanded its region of expression to the tip of the bud probably contributed to the evolution of skeletal extensions that made it possible for limbs to support vertebrates on land. The evolution of vertebrates from invertebrate animals was an even bigger episode in macroevolution, and it, too, was probably associated with changes in Hox genes (see FIGURE 24.23, p. 480).

In producing evolutionary novelties, changes in developmental dynamics, both temporal (heterochrony) and spatial, have undoubtedly played important roles in macroevolution.





 An evolutionary trend does not mean that evolution is goal oriented

The fossil record seems to reveal trends in the evolution of many species and lineages. For instance, some lineages exhibit a trend toward larger or smaller body size. A case in point is the evolution of the modern horse, which is a descendant of a much smaller ancestor named Hyracotherium. About the size of a large dog, Hyracotherium browsed in woodlands some 40 million years ago. In comparison to this ancestor, modern horses (genus Equus) are larger, the number of toes has been reduced from four on each foot to one, and the teeth have become modified for grazing on grasses rather than browsing on shrubs and trees. Do these macroevolutionary changes represent trends, and if so, how do we account for such trends?

Extracting a single evolutionary progression from a fossil record that is likely to be incomplete is misleading; it is like describing a bush as growing toward a single point by tracing the system of branches that leads from the base of the bush to one particular twig. For instance, by selecting certain species from the available fossils, it is possible to arrange a succession of animals intermediate between Hyracotherium and modern horses that shows trends toward increased size, reduced number of toes, and modification of teeth for grazing (yellow line in FIGURE 24.24). We might interpret this series of fossils as an unbranched lineage leading directly from Hyracotherium to modern horses through a continuum of intermediate stages. If we include all fossil horses known today, however, the illusion of coherent, progressive evolution leading directly to modern horses vanishes. The genus Equus is the only surviving twig of an evolutionary tree that is so branched that it is more like a bush. Equus descended through a series of speciation episodes that included several adaptive radiations, not all of which led to large, one-toed, grazing horses. For instance, notice in FIGURE 24.24 that only those lineages derived from Parahippus include grazers; other lineages derived from Miohippus produced browsers.

Fig 24-24. The branched evolution of horses. If we use a yellow highlighter to trace the sequence of fossil horses that are intermediate in form between the modern horse and its Eocene ancestor Hyracotherium, we create the illusion of a progressive trend toward larger size, reduced number of toes, and teeth modified for grazing. In fact, the modern horse is the only surviving twig of an evolutionary bush with many divergent trends.

Branching evolution can produce a macroevolutionary trend even if some new species counter the trend. In a view of macroevolution enunciated by Steven Stanley, of Johns Hopkins University, species are analogous to individuals: Speciation is their birth, extinction is their death, and new species are their offspring. According to this model, an evolutionary trend is produced by species selection, which is analogous to the production of a trend within a population by natural selection. The species that endure the longest and generate the greatest number of new species determine the direction of major evolutionary trends. This concept suggests that differential speciation plays a role in macroevolution similar to the role of differential reproduction in microevolution.

To the extent that speciation rates and species longevity reflect success, the analogy to natural selection is even stronger. But qualities unrelated to the overall success of organisms in specific environments may be equally important in species selection. For example, the ability of a species to disperse to new locations may contribute to its giving rise to a large number of "daughter species." The species selection model has many critics who argue that evolutionary trends more commonly result from the gradual modification of populations in response to environmental change. The value of such debates is that they stimulate research, and many paleontologists and other evolutionary biologists are now focusing on the question of what produces evolutionary trends.

Whatever its cause, the appearance of an evolutionary trend does not0 imply that there is some intrinsic drive toward a preordained state of being. Evolution is a response to interactions between organisms and their current environments. If conditions change, an evolutionary trend may cease or even reverse itself.

In the next chapter, we will continue our study of macroevolution with a more detailed look at the fossil record and some of the effects of significant environmental change on species and speciation.
