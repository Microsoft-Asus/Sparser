CAIRO , July 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Arab League -LRB- AL -RRB- has submitted a proposal to the United Nations and the Security Council containing a number of measures aimed at easing international sanctions on Libya .
The League 's spokesman Talaat Hammad said today that AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid submitted a joint proposal with the Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited New York last week .
The U.N. imposed sanctions against Tripoli for its refusal to hand over two Libyans suspected of involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie , Scotland , in 1988 .
Libyan leader Mummar Gaddafi has suggested trial of the two anywhere else than the United States and Britain .
Meguid told Annan that <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">the Libyan government has shown a great deal of flexibility in responding to international proposals , particularly those made by the AL and OAU , which suggest that the two Libyan suspects be tried according to the laws of Scotland before a neutral court to ensure a fair trial</ENAMEX> .
The Arab leader had asked Annan to persuade the countries concerned with the Lockerbie crisis to accept these ideas which he described as `` fair '' solutions to ending the dispute .
The AL chief had held intensive talks in Libya with Gaddafi and with African and Arab officials during the African summit in Harare on means of ending the Lockerbie crisis , said the spokesman .
The Libya - West crisis was discussed for the first time early this month at the Harare African summit which called for lifting the sanctions and taking temporary measures to help ease the sufferings of the Libyan people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Both the OAU and Al have been calling for a prompt lift of international sanctions against Libya over the Lockerbie crisis and aired support for Tripoli 's overtures to settle the dispute</ENAMEX> .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , during his two-day visit to the Libyan coastal city of Tobruk on June 12-13 , also denounced the UN -imposed ban on Libya and urged an immediate removal of it .
