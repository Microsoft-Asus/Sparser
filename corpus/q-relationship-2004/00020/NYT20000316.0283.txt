WASHINGTON --
President Clinton , preparing for a high stakes visit to India and Pakistan , warned both countries Thursday that he would not accept their nuclear weapons programs .
Until those programs are turned back , Clinton said , U.S. relations with those countries would be hampered .
`` There are those in the region who hope we will simply accept its nuclear status quo and move on .
I will not do that , '' Clinton said in video-taped remarks he prepared to open a non-proliferation conference here Thursday .
India declared itself a nuclear power after a series of underground tests in May , 1998 .
Within weeks , Pakistan exploded its own series of tests , and the world suddenly had two new nuclear powers -- and a new level of tension in the Indian subcontinent .
Clinton is scheduled to leave Saturday for a week-long swing through India , Pakistan and Bangladesh .
It will be the first presidential trip to the region since Jimmy Carter visited India in 1978 .
Clinton said he would carry with him a strong message that the tit-for-tat nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent has reduced security for India and Pakistan , not enhanced it .
`` India and Pakistan have legitimate security concerns , '' Clinton said .
`` But I will make clear our view that a nuclear future is a dangerous future for them and for the world .
And I 'll stress that narrowing our differences on nonproliferation is important to moving toward a broader relationship . ''
In response to the nuclear developments , the United States slapped India and Pakistan with sanctions restricting U.S. economic and military cooperation .
While the sanctions have been eased in recent months , following pledges by both countries not to undertake future nuclear tests , they wo n't be lifted altogether unless and until additional steps are taken , White House National Security Adviser Samuel Berger told reporters Thursday .
Clinton wants both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , for instance , codifying their pledge to halt weapons tests .
The president has signed the treaty , but the Senate has refused to ratify it .
Clinton also wants India and Pakistan to refrain from actually deploying nuclear weapons -- so far neither has deployed such arms -- agree not to export sensitive nuclear technology to countries trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability ; and enter into international negotiations over a new treaty to cut off the production of nuclear weapons fuel .
`` Neither side has deployed nuclear weapons , and I think that 's an important step not taken , '' Berger said .
`` There are obviously further steps that could be taken that would de-escalate the level of tension and put these weapons farther out of reach , '' Berger said .
`` As long as they have not met these steps ... we ca n't realize the full potential of our relationship . ''
