<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hong Kong supported Taiwan 's application for the World Trade Organization , but the island 's accession should not come ahead of mainland China 's , a top Hong Kong official said Wednesday .</ENAMEX>
In a written reply to a legislator 's question , Regina Ip , secretary for security , said `` Hong Kong has long supported Chinese Taipei 's application . ''
But the territory , a founding member of the WTO , would abide to an understanding that China 's accession should come before that of Taiwan , Ip wrote .
She was referring to an understanding reached in 1992 by the general council of the WTO 's predecessor , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
A government spokeswoman elaborated that the understanding had extended to the WTO .
Ip added the timing of Taiwan 's accession `` hinges on the progress of the overall negotiation and examination process necessary for '' its entry .
Ip 's declaration was in line with that stance of China , which regained Hong Kong 's sovereignty in July 1997 .
Although economic relations between the two sides have warmed up considerably , China -- which views Taiwan as a renegade province -- has said the island must not be admitted to the WTO ahead of it .
Relations across the Taiwan Strait have often been hostile since Chiang Kai -shek 's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to Mao Tse -tung 's Communists in 1949 .
Earlier this month , Taiwan and the United States signed a bilateral agreement for the island 's accession to the trade organization .
To date , the island has signed trade agreements with 23 out of the 26 organization members that requested bilateral talks .
Hong Kong , Canada and the European Union still need to sign with Taiwan .
Taiwan has successfully negotiated with all members that objected to its bid to join the 132-member trade body .
Taiwanese officials said they hope to enter the WTO early next year , but much depends on China 's attitude .
The WTO is the main international body governing global trade relations and setting fair trade rules .
There is general agreement China should join the organization and be bound by its responsibilities , but no agreement yet on the price for this .
Beijing wants to enter as a developing country , meaning it would have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of goods and services .
The United States , which has a big trade deficit with China , says the entry terms should be tougher as the Chinese economy is already well developed .
