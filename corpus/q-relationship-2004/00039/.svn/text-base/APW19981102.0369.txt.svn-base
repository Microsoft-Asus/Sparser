Eight Japanese fishing vessels approached a disputed island controlled by Russia , but fled before they could be intercepted by Russian border guard patrols , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported Monday .
The eight vessels were spotted Sunday by Russian border forces off Shikotan Island , part of the disputed Kuril Island chain .
The Japanese vessels failed to respond to radio messages and left Russian waters , the report said .
The incident happened in the same spot where three Japanese fishing vessels were detained by Russian patrols last month .
The vessels were expelled after their owners were fined dlrs 15,338 each .
Russian complains frequently of incursions by Japanese fishing vessels and there has been a string of confrontations and detentions , straining relations between Moscow and Tokyo .
Russia captured four islands in the Kuril chain from Japan at the end of World War II , and the two countries have never signed a peace treaty .
Despite periodic talks in recent years , there have been no breakthroughs .
