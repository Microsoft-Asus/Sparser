SEOUL , July 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea today threatened to retaliate if the United States imposes unilateral sanctions against it over access to its domestic telecommunications market .
South Korea 's Foreign Ministry spokesman Suh Dae -won said in a statement he regretted the U.S. decision to put the country on the U.S. Priority First Country -LRB- PFC -RRB- telecommunications list because of a dispute about government involvement in telecommunications procurement by private firms .
Negotiations on opening the South Korean telecommunications market must be carried out through the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , not on a bilateral basis , he said .
Seoul is prepared to actively consider accepting all reasonable demands from Washington but will take retaliatory measures against any U.S. unilateral sanctions , Suh said .
`` It is not appropriate for South Korea and the U.S. to sign a separate agreement stipulating that governments cannot and should not be involved in the procurement of telecommunications equipment by private firms , '' Suh added .
Washington has insisted since last March that the Seoul government provide U.S. firms with the same treatment as domestic firms in the South Korean corporate telecommunications equipment market .
