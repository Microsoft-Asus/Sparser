Two African presidents flew to Libya Wednesday , the second time in less than a month , violating U.N. sanctions that ban air travel there , Libyan radio reported .
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger and Idriss Deby of Chad landed in the northern coastal town of Sirte , state-run radio said in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. They followed President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda , who arrived Tuesday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The radio said the two presidents flew separately and arrived `` in implementation of the courageous decision adopted by the Organization of African Unity '' to ignore the sanctions</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The OAU earlier this year said it no longer would abide by the sanctions when travel to Libya was required for humanitarian activities or official business</ENAMEX> .
Mainassara and Deby flew to Libya on Sept. 5 with four other African leaders in violation of the sanctions to take part in Libya 's celebrations marking the 29th anniversary of the coup that brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power in 1969 .
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
