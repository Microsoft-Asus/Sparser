CELLULAR RESPONSES TO SIGNALS

 

 In response to a signal, a cell may regulate activities in the cytoplasm or transcription in the nucleus



 

 Elaborate pathways amplify and specify the cell's response to signals



We now take a closer look at the cell's eventual response to an extracellular signal--what some researchers call the "output response." What is the nature of the final step in a signaling pathway?
