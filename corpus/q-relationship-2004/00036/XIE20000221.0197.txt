The fifth part of the white paper , `` Several Questions Involving Adherence to the One - China Principle in the International Community '' , makes it a point that Taiwan is not eligible for membership of the United Nations and other international organizations whose membership is confined to sovereign states .
All members of the UN should adhere to the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and related UN resolutions , abide by norms governing international relations , including mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and interference in each other 's internal affairs , and never , in any form , support Taiwan 's joining the UN or other international organizations whose membership is confined to sovereign states .
On the basis of the principle of one China , the Chinese government has made arrangements for Taiwan 's participation in some inter-governmental international organizations which accept region membership in an agreeable and acceptable way according to the nature , regulations and actual conditions of these international organizations .
In September 1992 , the chairman of the council of the predecessor of the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- , stated that Taiwan may participate in this organization as `` a separate Taiwan - Penghu - Jinmen - Mazu tariff zone '' -LRB- abbreviated as Chinese Taipei -RRB- after the PRC 's entry to GATT .
The WTO should persist in the principle defined in the afore-said statement when examining the acceptance of Taiwan 's entry to the organization .
This is only an ad hoc arrangement and cannot constitute a model applicable to other inter-governmental international organizations or international gatherings .
No country maintaining diplomatic relations with China should provide arms to Taiwan or enter into military alliance of any form with Taiwan .
The U.S. has repeatedly contravened its solemn undertakings to China made in the August 17 Communique and continued its sale of advanced arms and military equipment to Taiwan .
Recently , some people in the U.S. Congress have cooked up the so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and are attempting to include Taiwan in the TMDS .
This is gross interference in China ` s internal affairs and a grave threat to China 's security , obstructing the peaceful reunification of China and jeopardizing the peace and stability of the Asia - Pacific region and the world at large .
The Chinese government is firmly against such actions .
