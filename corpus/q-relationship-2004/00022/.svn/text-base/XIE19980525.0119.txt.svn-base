The UNHCR , however , regretted that donors had contributed only 4.35 million U.S. Dollars , compared with the 39 million U.S. Dollars required .
It explained that two-thirds of this sum should help to finance the rehabilitation programs in the fields of education , health and program to generate funds for women and vulnerable groups .
The UNHCR estimated that before its repatriation operation began , there were about 479,000 Liberians still in exile , in Ghana , Guinea , Cote d 'Ivoire , Nigeria and Sierra Leone .
The refugees fled Liberia during the seven years of its civil war , which was brought to an end with the election of the Charles Taylor government last July .
