About 220 groups held protest marches on Saturday , organized by labor unions , the unemployed , churches and students .
With the slogan `` Stand up for political change , '' they blamed Chancellor Helmut Kohl for unemployment -- at 10.9 percent in May -- that is Germany 's highest since before World War II .
Protesters included Guenther Grass , Germany 's best-known author ; Juergen Tritten , a leader of the liberal Green party ; and Lothar Bisky , head of the PDS party of former East German communists .
The groups also protested rightist and leftist extremism , responding to Saturday 's anti-foreigner rally in Berlin by neo- Nazis and a counter rally by leftist punks .
