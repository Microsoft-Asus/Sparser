WASHINGTON , June 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korean President Kim Dae -jung will urge U.S. President Bill Clinton to ease sanctions against the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- in their upcoming talks , expected on Tuesday , as a new approach for security and stability on the Korean Peninsula .
Kim , who took office as president on February when his country was stricken by a financial crisis , will also seek new American investment for the troubled economy .
Kim started his nine-day state visit to the United States last Saturday .
It is his first visit to Washington since his inauguration , and also the first to meet with President Clinton .
He is expected to tell Clinton that it is time to loosen sanctions , which have hampered Western trade with the DPRK , and take a fresh approach to reduce tension on the peninsula .
`` It would be desirable for the United States to ease its economic sanctions on North Korea , '' Kim said in an interview with the New York Times last week in Seoul .
`` I think this would be more effective in effort to get North Korea to open up and liberalize . ''
Kim himself has made conciliatory statements for the relations between the two Koreans since taking office , which included suggestions for economic contacts and proposals for an inter- Korean summit meeting .
U.S. officials say they are open to the idea , which was brought up by a South Korean president for the first time .
White House spokesman Mike McCurry has ventured that Clinton would look forward to Tuesday 's meeting with Kim to consult and exchange views on promoting peace for the peninsula , where 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed .
A State Department official said that the United States `` in general supports President Kim 's policy of encouraging improvement in North - South dialogue and relations between the DPRK and other nations , including the United States . ''
Kim said , `` I think it is good for the U.S. to ease economic sanction against North Korea in order to promote U.S. - North Korean relations step by step . ''
Some U.S. think tanks share Kim 's view .
The Council on Foreign Relations , where Kim is to speak Monday , said recently that the U.S. government needs to move more quickly to expand contacts with the North .
`` It is time for a bolder approach , '' the council said in a report , compiled by a task force of foreign policy experts who met with Kim and senior aides in April .
President Kim will also deal with economic issues during his stay in the United States as he sees his visit as a crucial business trip to boost his country 's economy .
`` I will request U.S. assistance for the revival of the Korean economy , which is facing a crisis , '' Kim said before his departure for the United States .
`` I will ask American investors and international financial organizations for maximum assistance . ''
The South Korean economy is in desperate shape , held together largely by an emergency 57 million dollar bailout from the International Monetary Fund .
Kim has said foreign investment , especially by U.S. companies , is the key to recovery .
`` He wants to come back with at least something for the South Korean people , '' said You Jong -keun , one of Kim 's top advisers .
`` Whether it 's some concrete investment or some kind of moral support -- whether it is , he wants to bring something back with him . ''
Analysts say Kim 's visit to the United States is not expected to result in landmark new agreements , but rather to affirm a strong relationship and to give Kim a chance to try to rebuild international confidence in the tattered South Korean economy .
