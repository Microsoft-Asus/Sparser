Among the numerous hormones regulating the vertebrate body, tropic hormones have other endocrine glands as their targets. (The hormonal functions of the stomach, small intestine, heart, and thymus are discussed in Chapters 41, 42, and 43. The thymus secretes thymosin and other chemical messengers that stimulate the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes.)</p></LI><LI><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The hypothalamus and pituitary integrate many functions of the vertebrate endocrine system (pp. 962-964,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 45.5</span>, <span class="SmallCap">45.6</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus integrate endocrine and neural function by influencing the pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus that stores and releases two hormones (oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone, ADH) produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. Oxytocin induces uterine contractions and milk ejection, and ADH enhances water reabsorption in the kidneys. Under the direction of releasing and inhibiting hormones conveyed by portal vessels from the hypothalamus, the anterior pituitary produces an array of hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the endorphins. The tropic hormones TSH and the gonadotropins (FSH and LH) are chemically related and stimulate the thyroid gland and the gonads, respectively, to produce their hormones. GH promotes growth directly and stimulates the production of growth factors. Prolactin, named for its stimulation of lactation in mammals, has diverse effects in different vertebrates. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex. MSH influences skin pigmentation in some vertebrates and fat metabolism in mammals. Endorphins, the brain’s natural opiates, inhibit the perception of pain.</p></LI><LI><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The pineal gland is involved in biorhythms (pp. 964-965,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.5</span>, TABLE 45.1<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The pineal gland secretes melatonin, which influences skin pigmentation, biological rhythms, and reproduction in various vertebrates.</p></LI><LI><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Thyroid hormones function in development, bioenergetics, and homeostasis (pp. 965-966,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 45.5</span>, <span class="SmallCap">45.7</span>, <span class="SmallCap">45.8</span>, TABLE 45.1<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The thyroid gland produces iodine-containing hormones (T<SUB>3</SUB> and T<SUB>4</SUB>) that stimulate metabolism and influence development and maturation.

PTH works with calcitonin to maintain calcium homeostasis by acting directly on bone and kidneys. In addition, PTH stimulates the kidneys to activate vitamin D, which in turn stimulates the intestines to increase uptake of calcium from food.</p></LI><LI><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Endocrine tissues of the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon, antagonistic hormones that regulate blood glucose (pp. 966-969,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 45.5</span>, <span class="SmallCap">45.10</span>, TABLE 45.1<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The endocrine portion of the pancreas consists of islet cells that secret insulin and glucagon. High blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin, which increases the cellular uptake of glucose, promotes the formation and storage of glycogen in the liver, and stimulates protein synthesis and fat storage. Low blood glucose levels trigger glucagon release, which increases blood glucose by stimulating the conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver and increasing the breakdown of fat and protein. Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder resulting in a lack of insulin. Type II diabetes is usually caused by the loss of responsiveness of target cells to insulin.</p></LI><LI><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex help the body manage stress (pp. 969-971,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 45.5</span>, <span class="SmallCap">45.11</span>-<span class="SmallCap">45.14</span>, TABLE 45.1<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress-activated impulses from the nervous system. These hormones mediate various fight-or-flight responses. The adrenal cortex releases corticosteroids (including sex hormones), glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids influence glucose metabolism and the immune system; mineralocorticoids affect salt and water balance.</p></LI><LI><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior (p. 972,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.5</span>, TABLE 45.1<span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The gonads--testes and ovaries--produce varying proportions of three kinds of steroid hormones: androgens, estrogens, and progestins.</p><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity45D:<span class="Emphasis1">
