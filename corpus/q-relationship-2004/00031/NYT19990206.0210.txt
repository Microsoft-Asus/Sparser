AMMAN , Jordan --
As King Hussein lay in his hospital under sedation and on a respirator , Jordanians slowly began acknowledging the bad news that will likely end their monarch 's grave struggle with cancer .
Saturday morning , the Jordanian cabinet , declaring Hussein unfit for office , renewed the authority of his first son Crown Prince Abdullah bin Hussein , over the country .
Abdullah was in charge during the five days of ill-fated cancer treatment that Hussein , 63 , underwent in Minnesota last week .
But this is the first time in Hussein 's 47-year reign that he has been relieved of his duties while he was in the country .
The transfer of power , in all likelihood , brought an end to the rule of King Hussein .
He has been a force for peace and stability in a region cursed by turbulence and has consulted with every U.S. president since Dwight Eisenhower .
The torch was passed to his 37-year -old Abdullah , considered capable but inexperienced .
Foreign embassies from other Arab states said their leaders were preparing to head to Jordan for an expected funeral , and advance teams from the United States were clearing the way for a visit from President Bill Clinton .
In the sparse office of Jordan 's ministry for Islamic sites and affairs -LRB- CQ .
formal name includes an esoteric Arabic word -RRB- , a bureaucrat and long-time friend of Hussein 's agonized over another issue -- whether he would be among the religious officials called to determine whether the medical treatment for Hussein could be ended .
`` This is a desperate case , '' said Hamdi Murad , a top religious government official who has often given Islamic advice to the royal family .
`` We are on standby . ''
He said it would likely be up to Abdullah , as first son and heir to the throne , to make the final decision on Hussein 's treatment .
According to Islam , Murad said , life-support machines were similar to medicine and must be employed as long as there is even just a remote chance of recovery .
Most of the official information about Hussein 's status came in a four-sentence statement from his chief physician .
It said Hussein was on a respirator because he has trouble breathing and that he was `` under sedation . ''
The statement said his heart and brain were `` intact '' and that his condition was stable .
His only kidney -- the other was removed in cancer treatment in 1992 -- and liver have stopped functioning .
Also , it was confirmed that Hussein has been unconscious since hours before he was put on his airplane to return from Minnesota Thursday , when doctors said a bone marrow transplant had failed .
He suffers from non- Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph glands .
Jordan 's ambassador to the United States , Marwan Muasher , told Jordanian television that , on the return trip from Minnesota , Queen Noor allowed the family members and close staff on board to each sit for a few moments alone with the unconscious king .
Clearly , there was a process underway to prepare the Jordanian people for the shock of their first transition of power in nearly half a century .
Jordan , a poor country of just 4.4 million people , has often been threatened by invasions and wars among its neighbors -- primarily Israel to the west and Iraq to the east .
Hussein , whose picture hangs in nearly every store and many homes , was seen as the country 's savior from such threats , as a well as pro-western , moderating , force on the whole region .
Among the Jordanian press , heavily influenced by the government , one newspaper wrote about Hussein as if his death was imminent and another , the English -language Jordan Times , quoted an unnamed government official saying Hussein wanted to be among his people and was in a coma .
Queen Noor left her husband 's side long enough to emerge from the King Hussein Medical Center to meet a shocked a crowd of several hundred of her subjects who have been keeping a constant vigil there .
There was near mayhem as people tried to get close to the queen and several of the Hussein 's sons .
The vigil seemed to be the site of the last diehards , still holding out hope that Hussein could survive .
At the time for evening prayers , one of the five prayer times each day in Islam , about 40 men who had spent the night in cars and the cold rain outside the medical center kneeled to pray for Hussein .
Many wore the red-and-white checkered head scarfs of Bedoiun tradition and had come from about 80 miles away .
`` He is our life .
Please give him health , '' prayer leader Sheikh Khaled Mohammed Alghan called out to Allah .
`` You are the one who gives life and death ... the machines cannot save him and the heart is weak .
Please give him life . ''
