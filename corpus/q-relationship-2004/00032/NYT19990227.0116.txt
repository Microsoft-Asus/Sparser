BEIJING --
The Chinese government Saturday night issued a predictably tart response to the lambasting of its human rights record in a State Department report on Friday , expressing `` strong resentment . ''
The statement , read on the television news here , accused the United States of hypocritically meddling in China 's affairs by `` fabricating unwarranted charges '' while ignoring serious rights violations at home .
The official response did not mention that on Friday Wu Yilong , one of the founders of a banned alternative political party , was detained in the eastern city of Hangzhou for questioning .
Peng Ming , a liberal intellectual who tried to run an independent discussion forum in Beijing , was also sentenced on Friday , without trial , to 1 -LCB- years in a labor camp .
These latest developments only add to the pressure on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to take a strong line on human rights in the talks she will hold here with Chinese leaders on Monday .
While both sides are hoping to nurture common ground in the meetings , Albright will undoubtedly prod China over other perennial American concerns , such as weapons sales and a widening imbalance of trade .
But she is likely to get an earful in return from the Chinese , who are worried and perplexed by the seeming nose dive in relations with the United States , which only last summer pledged to work for a `` strategic partnership . ''
Recent American policies and statements , Chinese foreign policy experts assert , have been insensitive to China 's legitimate needs on several matters .
These include the administration 's decision this week to bar sale of a satellite to a company with indirect ties to the Chinese military , its sharp criticism on human rights , its demands for a rapid opening of markets and talk of a possible missile defense system for Taiwan .
China tends to see specific setbacks , such as the barred satellite sale , as the work of deeper , hostile political forces .
`` We interpret the satellite dispute as a reflection of strategic thinking that regards China as a threat and an adversary , '' said Chu Shulong , director of North American studies at the China Institute for Contemporary International Relations , a government research organization .
`` The talk in America of a ` China threat , ' '' Chu said , `` is something we really worry about . ''
In the Chinese view , their country is no threat to world peace , but is simply taking its rightful place as one of the world 's great powers .
Many of the strongest American concerns about China , analysts here tend to believe , reflect a desire to keep China in a second-class status .
Among officials and even many liberal intellectuals , there is deep resentment of what they see as a foreign caricature of an increasingly diverse and vibrant Chinese society as a grim police state .
Yes , some people who actively threatened Communist Party rule have been jailed .
But at the same time , people here constantly note , Chinese have more personal choices than ever , private business is booming and the rule of law is starting to take hold .
Albright 's visit , and another later in the week by the American trade representative , Charlene Barshefsky , are intended in part to prepare for a high-profile visit to the United States in April by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji .
Trade officials are negotiating furiously over China 's desired entry into the World Trade Organization .
A breakthrough would crown Zhu 's American trip and give a needed boost to bilateral relations .
But chances appear slim that China , grappling with a major restructuring of industry and soaring unemployment , can make enough trade concessions now to satisfy American demands .
Despite all the festering problems , both governments seem to hope that Zhu 's visit can rekindle some of the glow that emanated from the exchange of presidential summits in late 1997 and last summer .
Though they will not concede their own principles to achieve it , the Chinese leaders are anxious to sustain friendly ties : They know that American technology and cooperation are vital to their economic progress and besides , most Chinese admire American culture .
Just this week , the Grammy Awards ceremony was broadcast live on state-run radio .
At the same time , the Chinese are smarting over what they see as worrisome trends in American policy .
They fear that the decision to bar a commercial satellite sale portends new , broader curbs on transfers of advanced technologies .
In public , at least , officials scoff at the notion that they are stealing secrets for military application .
`` From the Chinese point of view , this decision is very hard to understand , '' said Jia Qingguo , a professor of international studies at Beijing University .
`` The Americans complain about a trade gap , but then they do n't want to sell what China wants to buy . ''
On human rights , China will vehemently urge the United States not to sponsor a resolution criticizing China at the annual U.N. conference on human rights , to begin in Geneva in late March .
In the wake of stiff sentences China has dealt to several democracy activists , Congress is pressuring the administration to act .
But the Chinese government , which argues that society is gradually loosening , sees such resolutions as gross intrusions on its sovereignty .
`` China feels very strongly about this , '' said Chu of the government research group .
The Chinese government has made a commitment to change its human rights practices gradually , said Jia , but it also must worry about social stability as it tackles severe economic problems .
`` What do Americans wish China to do , unleash a wave of political unrest ? ''
Jia asked .
`` Political instability here is not in the interest of the United States . ''
In meetings Monday with Albright , China is also sure to register its adamant opposition to proposed research by the United States and Japan on a `` theater missile defense '' system .
The technology remains hypothetical , but discussions of missile defenses were quickened by North Korea 's test of a long-range missile -- seen especially as a threat to Japan -- as well as by China 's buildup of missiles on its coast facing Taiwan .
China has warned that introducing missile defenses to Asia will only trigger a regional arms race .
But the basic idea of using such weapons to shore up American power in Asia -- and possibly blunt China 's -- is anathema here .
And what most outrages the Chinese is the speculation that such a shield might be extended to Taiwan , which is considered a renegade province .
Providing missile defenses to Taiwan , Jia said , `` would not only damage China 's sovereignty , but also pose an obstacle to unification of the country . ''
China 's leaders know that these issues and others will inevitably divide China and the United States .
But they had hoped , especially after Clinton 's glittering visit here last June , that disagreements could be boxed off as the countries pursued their `` partnership . ''
As an overarching goal of this week 's meetings and the prime minister 's April visit , Chu said , `` China wants to reconfirm the positive trend in relations . ''
