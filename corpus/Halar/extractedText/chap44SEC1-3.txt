WATER BALANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL

 

 Water balance and waste disposal depend on transport epithelia



 

 An animal's nitrogenous wastes are correlated with its phylogeny and habitat



 

 Cells require a balance between osmotic gain and loss of water



 

 Osmoregulators expend energy to control their internal osmolarity; osmoconformers are isoosmotic with their surroundings



Just as thermoregulation depends on balancing heat loss and gain, an animal's ability to regulate the chemical composition of its body fluids depends on balancing the uptake and loss of water and solutes. This osmoregulation (management of the body's water content and solute composition) is largely based on controlled movements of solutes between internal fluids and the external environment. This also regulates the movement of water, which follows solutes by osmosis. Animals must also remove various metabolic waste products before they accumulate to harmful levels.

The ultimate function of osmoregulation is to maintain the composition of the cytoplasm of the body's cells, but most animals do this indirectly by managing the composition of an internal body fluid that bathes the cells. In insects and other animals with an open circulatory system, this fluid is the hemolymph (see Chapter 42). In vertebrates and other animals with a closed circulatory system, the cells are bathed in an interstitial fluid. The composition of interstitial fluid is controlled indirectly by managing the composition of blood. Animals often have complex organs, such as the kidneys of vertebrates, that are specialized for the maintenance of fluid composition.
