Genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together in genetic crosses because the chromosome is passed along as a unit. Such genes are said to be <span class="Emphasis2">linked genes.</span> (Note that these genes are linked to each other. Here the use of the word <span class="Emphasis1">linked</span> is different from its use in the term <span class="Emphasis1">sex-linked gene,</span> where the gene is on a sex chromosome.) When geneticists follow linked genes in breeding experiments, the results deviate from those expected according to the Mendelian principle of independent assortment.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s examine another of Morgan’s <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> experiments to see how linkage between genes affects the inheritance of two different characters (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.4</span>). In this case, the characters are body color and wing size. Wild-type flies have gray bodies and normal wings. Morgan had flies with mutant versions of these characters: black body and vestigial wings (much smaller than normal wings). The alleles for these traits are represented by the following symbols: <span class="Emphasis1">b</span><SUP>+</SUP> = gray, <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> = black; <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span><SUP>+</SUP> = normal wings, <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> = vestigial wings.<A href="javascript:popNote('15','1')"><SUP><B>*</B></SUP></A> The mutant alleles are recessive to the wild-type alleles, and neither gene is sex-linked.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig15-4','../fig/big/fig15-4.jpg','fig15-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig15-4.jpg" alt="fig15-4" name="myfig15-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 15-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Evidence for linked genes in <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila.</span></span> The tinted area highlights a testcross between a dihybrid female fly, heterozygous for both body color and wing size, and a double-recessive male, homozygous for both recessive alleles. (The male has a "double mutant" phenotype.) When Morgan "scored" (classified according to phenotype) 2,300 offspring from such matings, he observed a much higher proportion of parental phenotypes than would be expected if the two genes assorted independently. Morgan concluded that these genes are usually transmitted together because they are located on the same chromosome. Crossing over accounts for the recombinant phenotypes (combinations of traits different from the combination in either parent).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Morgan mated true-breeding wild-type flies (<span class="Emphasis1">b</span><SUP>+</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">b</span><SUP>+</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">vg</span><SUP>+</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">vg</span><SUP>1+</SUP>) with black, vestigial-winged ones (<span class="Emphasis1">b b vg vg</span>) to produce F<SUB>1</SUB> dihybrids <span class="Emphasis1">(b</span><SUP>+</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">b</span><span class="Emphasis1">vg</span><SUP>+</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">vg),</span> which are wild type in appearance.

According to Mendel’s law of independent assortment, Morgan’s <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> testcross should produce four phenotypic classes of offspring that are about equal in number: 1 gray-normal : 1 black-vestigial : 1 gray-vestigial : 1 black-normal. (To see why, rework <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.6</span> with a dihybrid.) But the actual results were different: There were disproportionately large numbers of wild-type (gray-normal) and double-mutant (black-vestigial) flies among the offspring. These two phenotypes correspond to those of the P generation parents, as well as to those of the parents in the testcross. Morgan reasoned that body color and wing shape are usually inherited together in specific combinations because the genes for these characters are on the same chromosome:</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Although the other two phenotypes (gray-vestigial and black-normal) numbered fewer than expected based on independent assortment, these phenotypes <span class="Emphasis1">were</span> represented among the offspring of Morgan’s cross. These new phenotypic variations resulted from crossing over, discussed next.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
