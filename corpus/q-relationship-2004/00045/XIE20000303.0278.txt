ROME , March 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Criminal activity and political corruption remain the greatest threats to society in Italy , said a study released Thursday by the Italian think-tank , Censis .
Although mafia-related murders have dropped dramatically from 719 cases in 1991 to 208 in 1998 , other forms of organized crime such as extortion and arson , and attempts to dynamite buildings and other structures have increased , the study said .
It pointed out that an inefficient judicial system also remains a major problem .
`` Exasperating slowness with which cases go to trial '' has caused distrust in the legal system , Censis said , noting that 42 percent of first-time cases and 72 percent of appeal cases take more than three years to complete .
