MAPUTO , September 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Mozambican Finance Minister Luisa Diogo Thursday rejected a widely held saying that the International Monetary Funds -LRB- IMF -RRB- and the World Bank are instruments of the rich countries , arguing the two institutions are also useful to developing countries , though they need reforms .
`` We know countries that chose to stop being members -LRB- of the IMF and the World Bank -RRB- , but they ended up with more problems than they had when they were members , '' said Diogo in Prague , capital of the Czech Republic , where she were attending the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank .
She said some of such countries found that they no longer had the funds to import basic goods like fuel and medicines .
`` The important thing is that these institutions have to listen to all their members in order to improve their work to the benefit to all , '' she said .
According to the minister , she believes that the new head of the IMF , Horst Kohler , as well as World Bank President James Wolfensohn , are genuinely interested in changing the way their organizations operate so that all their members can benefit from them .
