When Pino Arlacchi , the director of the U.N. International Drug Control Program , addressed the General Assembly 13 months ago and proposed eliminating opium poppy and coca leaf cultivation in 10 years , his strategy was greeted with polite skepticism .
The notion of getting opium and coca farmers to grow less profitable crops in return for the promise of schools , medical clinics and roads and other means to a better life struck many listeners as unrealistic .
But Arlacchi says that his timetable for eradicating the raw ingredients for heroin and cocaine around the world is , if anything , running ahead of schedule in some countries , though he acknowledged difficulties in others .
Arlacchi insisted that people are taking alternative development , as his strategy is called , more seriously .
`` The skepticism has disappeared , '' he said in a telephone interview from the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention headquarters in Vienna , Austria .
`` Now we 're not discussing any more if it 's possible to eliminate opium poppy and coca production .
We are discussing how to do it . ''
As evidence , Arlacchi cited the progress achieved in Peru and Bolivia over the last year and a half .
In Bolivia , 34,000 acres of coca plants have been eradicated since the beginning of 1998 .
He described this as equivalent to depriving the drug market of nearly 43 tons of cocaine .
In Peru , more than 50,000 acres were taken out of coca cultivation , an amount equivalent to pulling nearly 65 tons of cocaine from the market .
The decline began before Arlacchi began spreading his gospel of alternative development , thanks to separate efforts by the Peruvian and Bolivian governments , which included Peru 's air interdiction of aircraft transporting coca base to Colombia .
Peruvian coca cultivation dropped by 56 percent between 1995 and 1998 , according to the White House 's Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Bolivian coca cultivation , it said , declined by 17 percent last year .
Arlacchi estimated that it will cost $ 5 billion over a 10-year period to phase out coca leaf and opium poppy production .
His recipe includes money from international donations , cooperation by local governments and `` a modest degree of coercion '' to make farmers switch to legal crops .
Opium poppy production in Afghanistan looks likely to increase this year , Arlacchi said , but the ruling Taliban militia is showing more willingness to help reverse the trend .
In June , he said , nearly 1,000 acres of opium poppies were eradicated in Qandahar province , where the U.N. drug control agency has an alternative development project .
The acreage taken out of cultivation would have produced about 24 tons of opium , or 2.4 tons of heroin .
By bringing alternative development to Qandahar , Arlacchi said , `` We removed 2.4 tons of heroin with a $ 5 million investment . ''
And in Shinwar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan , Arlacchi said , the Taliban promised to confiscate any increase over last year 's opium harvest .
Afghanistan vies with Myanmar , formerly Burma , as the world 's biggest producer of opium .
After Arlacchi visited Laos in May , he reported that the Laotian government agreed to phase out opium poppy production there over a six-year period .
`` This is significant because Laos is the third largest producer of opium , '' he said .
Arlacchi said that he promised to raise $ 80 million to finance Laotian alternative development programs .
Previous opium production in Thailand and Pakistan , he noted , also dropped off once programs were put in place to help farmers there grow other crops .
But Arlacchi said that `` Myanmar has made very modest progress '' in reducing its opium output .
While coca cultivation plunged in Bolivia and Peru , it increased next door in Colombia , the primary source of cocaine .
Arlacchi , who last visited Colombia in March , said that eradicating its coca crops depends on whether the government can achieve peace with leftist guerrillas who control wide swatches of countryside .
With a credible peace , he said , `` We can really say that the years of illicit crops are numbered . ''
But if peace efforts fail in Colombia , he said , the progress made in reducing coca production in the Andean countries will suffer .
In addition to soliciting funds from the United States and other major donor countries , Arlacchi has also met with James Wolfensohn , the president of the World Bank .
The bank previously did not regard drug eradication as a development issue , Arlacchi said , but `` now the World Bank body is starting slowly to change its attitude . ''
