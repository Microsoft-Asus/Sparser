VIENNA , Austria
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Afghanistan 's opium poppy farmers are expected to harvest 25 percent less of the illicit crop this year than last , thanks mostly to bad weather , the U.N. drug control agency said Tuesday .
In a report , the U.N. Drug Control Program , based here , estimated Afghanistan 's 1998 production would reach about 2,100 metric tons , or about 25 percent below the 1997 yield of 2,800 metric tons .
`` An unusually long 1998 winter season , heavy and continuous rains and hail storms in southern Afghanistan and unseasonal rains in northern Afghanistan are all factors which adversely affected the opium yield , '' the report said .
Despite the projected decline , the U.N. Drug Control Program said opium poppy cultivation spread for the first time to two new Afghan provinces -- Loghar and Laghman -- as well as several new districts .
That raises concern that -- barring an effective government crackdown -- next year 's crop could increase significantly if the weather improves .
`` I appeal to all parties in Afghanistan to exert their best efforts in order to dissuade the farmers from planting opium poppy in the coming growing season , especially in new areas , '' the head of the drug control agency , Pino Arlacchi , said .
Arlacchi warned that if his appeal goes unheeded , he will ask U.N. member states to tighten controls on Afghanistan 's land borders .
Afghanistan is a leading source of opium poppies , used in the production of heroin .
The United Nations estimates that heroin of Afghan origin accounts for 80 percent of the European market and 20 percent of the American .
More than 90 percent of the illicit crop is grown in areas of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban , the hardline Islamic movement which holds the capital Kabul and most of the mountainous Central Asian country .
The Taliban has agreed to work with the United Nations to curb production and encourage farmers to grow alternate crops .
But U.N. officials say the Taliban has been dragging its heels on fulfilling the promise to pressure the United Nations into awarding it Afghanistan 's seat in the U.N. General Assembly .
The seat remains in the hands of the previous government pending a final decision .
As a result , the former leadership will still be entitled to attend U.N. conferences as the legitimate government of Afghanistan .
