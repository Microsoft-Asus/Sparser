LIFE HISTORIES

 

 Life histories are highly diverse, but they exhibit patterns in their variability



 

 Limited resources mandate trade-offs between investments in reproduction and survival



Natural selection will favor traits in organisms that improve their chances of survival and reproductive success. Organisms that survive a long time but do not reproduce are not at all "fit" in the Darwinian sense. In every species, there are trade-offs between survival and traits such as frequency of reproduction, investment in parental care, and the number of offspring produced (seed crops for seed plants and litter size or clutch size for animals). The traits that affect an organism's schedule of reproduction and survival (from birth through reproduction to death) make up its life history. Of course, a particular life history, like most characteristics of an organism, is the result of natural selection operating over evolutionary time. Life history traits help determine how populations grow.
