BEIJING
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Pushing its claim over Taiwan into complex trade negotiations , Beijing insisted Thursday that the World Trade Organization only admit Taiwan as a part of China .
The demand by Beijing threatens to impede Taiwan 's membership bid as both the island and China near the end of their separate years-long negotiations to join global trade 's rule-setting body .</ENAMEX>
It also complicates a debate in the U.S. Senate this week on whether to approve a WTO pact with China .
Influential senators released a letter from President Clinton on Wednesday weighing in on Taiwan 's side .
Clinton wrote that his administration opposes Chinese efforts to call Taiwan `` a separate customs territory of China . ''
Brushing aside the opposition , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said Thursday that China wanted its sovereignty claim to Taiwan written into the terms for Taiwanese membership to WTO. `` The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position : Taiwan can join WTO as a separate customs territory of China , '' Sun said at a twice-weekly media briefing .
He accused Taiwan of using the WTO negotiations to engage in separatism .
The dispute over what the WTO should call Taiwan underscores the 51-year split between the island and the mainland and China 's attempts to coax Taipei into unification .
It also revives a debate that has simmered for years in working groups negotiating terms for Taiwan 's entry to WTO and its predecessor , GATT .
Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1990 as `` the customs territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu , '' thereby avoiding the questions of sovereignty and statehood .
Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu are small island groups under Taiwan 's control .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">GATT and now WTO rules allow regions in control of their trade but without full statehood to join as separate territories .
Under a 1992 agreement that allowed separate working groups to negotiate Chinese and Taiwanese bids , GATT members acknowledged China 's sovereignty claim to Taiwan and out of deference said Taiwan could only join after Beijing .
Sun , the Foreign Ministry spokesman , insisted that the 1992 agreement recognized Taiwan as a separate customs territory of China .</ENAMEX>
