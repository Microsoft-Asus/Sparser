SANTAFE DE BOGOTA , October 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Colombian police chief described Wednesday a jointly anti-drug operation codenamed `` Millennium '' as perfect .
The operation , carried out by the authorities of Colombia , Mexico and Ecuador with U.S. help , `` is perfect , because it thwarted the most rampant drug trafficking in the world , '' said Director of the Colombian Police Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena .
It is the third most significant campaign against international drug networks , following previous twice massive actions taken by Colombia in the middle of this decade , which led to the dissolution of the Medellin and Cali drug cartels , the police chief said .
He highlighted the detention of the ex-convict Fabio Ochoa Vazquez and other 29 suspects , all of them facing possible extradition to the U.S. , as the result of this operation .
Ochoa Vazquez , along with his brothers Jorge Luis and Juan David , formed the drug smuggling ring known as the `` Clan Ochoa '' , which was linked to the disbanded Medellin cartel led by late Pablo Escobar Gaviria who died in 1993 during a police operation .
In 1991 , at the mercy of the courts , the Ochoas were sentenced up to 8 years imprisonment and locked up in the maximum security prison of Itagua , in the northeastern Colombian province of Antioquia .
Due to good behaviour and confessions , the term was later reduced to 5 years .
Serrano Cadena added there was a total of 200 police involved in Operation `` Millennium '' , during which a total of 72 operations were carried out in the cities of Bogota , Medellin and Cali .
Operation `` Millennium '' signaled a message to the drug traffickers that this is not a game , and `` they will be subjected to the judicial system '' for their activities , the officer stressed .
Colombian drug traffickers have controlled a large part of the U.S. cocaine market , and Colombia produces at a rate of 80 percent of the global drug , he added .
