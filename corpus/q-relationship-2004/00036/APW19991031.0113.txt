TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Taiwan probably wo n't meet its goal of joining the World Trade Organization this year , a newspaper on Sunday quoted a Taiwanese official as saying .
After returning from meetings in the United States and Europe , Lin Yi -fu , vice minister of economic affairs , said Saturday that the WTO told him completing Taiwan 's membership would be `` very difficult '' this year , the China Times reported .
Taiwan was expected to enter the WTO late this year after China joined the 134-nation group .
But Beijing 's talks with the United States and the European Union have n't yielded much progress .
The WTO , which began operations in 1995 , sets rules for international trade and encourages trade liberalization .
