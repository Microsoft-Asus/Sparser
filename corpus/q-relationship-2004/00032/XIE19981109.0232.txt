LOS ANGELES , November 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- There is not enough scientific evidence so far for antioxidant therapy , according to an American doctor of medicine .
Two ongoing trials may provide a definitive answer to the debate about whether antioxidants supplementation is effective as primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease -LRB- CHD -RRB- , said John Keaney , Jr. , associate professor at Boston University 's School of Medicine , at the ongoing 71st annual American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in Dallas .
One of the trials he mentioned is the women 's health study of primary and secondary prevention of CHD , including 40,000 healthy U.S. female nurses .
`` Until these studies are completed , there is no solid evidence that antioxidants will or will not prolong life , '' said Keaney , whose presentation is posted at the annual session 's Web site .
Although the link between elevated total cholesterol and atherosclerosis is well-established , he said , the medical community still does not know precisely how cholesterol leads to heart attacks and stroke .
However , doctors do know that LDL cholesterol particles cannot cause atherosclerosis unless they are oxidized .
This knowledge has stimulated interest in the role of antioxidants in preventing heart disease , Keaney said .
The interest is probably even greater in the United States , where cardiovascular disease remains a major clinical problem .
Statistics from 1990 estimate that 55 out of every 100,000 Americans will die of coronary artery disease each year .
The economic cost of cardiovascular disease exceed 225 billion U.S. dollars annually in the United States .
There is currently a wealth of epidemiological data examining the interaction between antioxidant intake or antioxidant status and the development of vascular disease .
The data consist of a collection of descriptive studies , case-controlled studies , prospective cohort studies and a limited number of randomized data .
But Keaney said the distinction between study types is important because only randomized , controlled studies should be used to make public health recommendations .
He made a point by citing descriptive studies , which examine the characteristics of a population and its associated disease rates , and compare the data sets from one time period or country to the next .
In general , descriptive studies suffer from the inability to control for potential confounding factors .
A total of five descriptive studies published since 1975 have shown an inverse association between fresh fruit and vegetable consumption and cardiovascular disease rates or , in some cases , between certain vitamins -LRB- i.e. , vitamin C , vitamin A -RRB- and cardiovascular disease mortality rates .
Keaney said that the strongest theme from these studies is an observed trend across populations , and within populations over time , that fresh fruit and vegetable consumption protects against cardiovascular disease .
But whether this is due to the intake of dietary antioxidants or the replacement by fresh fruits and vegetable of potentially harmful dietary components such as animal fats cannot be determined .
