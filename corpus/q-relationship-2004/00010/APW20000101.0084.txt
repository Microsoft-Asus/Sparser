KANDAHAR , Afghanistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The five hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane vanished into the desert of southern Afghanistan and by this morning had crossed the border into a neighboring country , according to a Taliban official .
The hijackers presumably went to Pakistan , the nearest country and the only one they could easily reach within the 10 hours they were given to get out of Afghanistan under a deal struck Friday afternoon .
The deal peacefully ended a tense eight-day standoff in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar .
All 155 hostages were freed and were flown to New Delhi , India .
The hijackers sped out of the airport in several vehicles , taking three Muslim militants freed from Indian jails and one hostage -- a soldier from Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban movement .
`` The Taliban hostage has come back to Kandahar and -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- have gone from the country , '' Taliban spokesman Rehnatullah Aga said today .
Aga declined to say where the hijackers went , but the only realistic possibility was that the group drove for several hours to the border with Pakistan , where there are countless places to cross the frontier on foot .
The Taliban initially had been reluctant to get involved in negotiations with the hijackers , and when the crisis ended Friday , the movement hurried the men out of its territory as soon as possible .
The Taliban sent a heavily armed group of soldiers with the hijackers to ensure that they left Afghanistan promptly .
Pakistan strongly denounced the hijacking , but it has little control over its lengthy western border that may have been used as an escape route .
`` Hijackings are particularly abhorrent to us , '' Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry said Friday evening in a statement .
`` We have no sympathy for such desperate acts . ''
Identifying the hijackers could prove difficult because they remained masked throughout the eight days .
Taliban authorities said they did not know the names or nationalities of the hijackers , though they acted in support of Kashmir militants who are fighting to end Indian rule of the Himalayan territory .
The hijackers were traveling with three prominent Kashmiri militants , who were freed by India in exchange for the release of the hostages on the airplane .
Masood Azhar , a leader of Harkat ul- Ansar , a group on a U.S. list of terrorist organizations , was the best known of the three men released .
In addition , the Indians freed Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar , chief commander of the rebel group Ul - Umar Mujahideen , and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh , who was held in a New Delhi prison .
The hijacking demonstrated the volatile nature of the long-running dispute over Kashmir , the leading source of friction between India and Pakistan .
Both nations hold part of Kashmir and claim all of it .
India and Pakistan traded recriminations during the latest hijacking crisis , placing further strain on already bad relations .
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Friday that `` there is no bowing to terrorism . ''
The three Muslim militants , who had been convicted of terrorism , were released only to protect the lives of the hostages , he said .
The plane on which the hostages were held left the airport at Kandahar this morning and headed back to India after authorities had completed repairs and checked for any potential problems .
