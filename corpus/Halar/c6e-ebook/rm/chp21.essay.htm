									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">Genes important in the embryonic development of animals, such as homeobox-containing genes, have been relatively well conserved during evolution; that is, they are more similar between different species than are many other genes. Why is this?</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">Stem cells in an adult organism send some daughter cells down a differentiation pathway, while maintaining their own relatively undifferentiated cell population. During a given mitotic division, one daughter cell remains a stem cell and the other initiates a differentiation pathway. Propose one or more hypotheses to explain how this can happen. (<span class="Emphasis1">Note:</span>There is no easy answer to this question, but it is well worth considering.)</p>
