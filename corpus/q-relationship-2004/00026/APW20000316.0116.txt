-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Actor Vladimir Steklov was supposed to blast off to the Mir next month to portray a renegade cosmonaut who wo n't leave the space station , but now Russia wo n't let him get off Earth , a space official said Thursday .
The space movie in which Steklov was to have starred was another in a series of unorthodox proposals for resuscitating the dormant space station with private money .
But Konstantin Kreidenko , a spokesman for the Russian Aerospace Agency , said that Steklov `` will not go to Mir as earlier planned because of the failure to meet the terms of the contract . ''
Kreidenko declined to give details , but it appears that Steklov 's producers could n't pay for his ticket .
Although producers of the movie , tentatively titled `` The Last Journey , '' claimed they made an initial payment to get the project under way , Russian space officials complained they have n't even been paid for Steklov 's training , let alone the multimillion-dollar bill for the flight .</ENAMEX>
Steklov complained that his investment of time for training came to nothing .
`` Now I am a jobless actor , a hobo , '' he said , according to the Interfax news agency .
The movie was to have told the story of a renegade cosmonaut who refuses to leave Mir , insisting he 'll orbit the Earth for the rest of his days .
Ground controllers decide to send up a woman to lure him back .
In real life , cosmonauts Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri are tentatively set to blast off to Mir on April 4 , he said .
The station has been unmanned since August .
Zalyotin and Kaleri are expected to spend 45 days on board Mir .
They will take a movie camera with them and possibly shoot some footage for the movie , Kreidenko said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The state-controlled RKK Energia company that built and owns the 14-year old station has made frantic efforts to keep it aloft by raising private funds .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Russia 's cash-strapped government had said it would abandon the station this month unless private investors came up with funds .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But the government changed its mind and kept Mir in orbit after the Amsterdam -based MirCorp agreed to pay between $ 10 million and $ 20 million -- the price was not disclosed -- for the rights to offer rides to space tourists , provide satellite repair and produce products in weightlessness .</ENAMEX>
Ownership of the station remains with the Russian government , and Acting President Vladimir Putin has already pledged to keep Mir alive .
The government has ruled that Energia can use booster rockets and cargo ships for the Mir which had originally been earmarked for the International Space Station project .
The reapportioning has angered the U.S. space agency NASA ; the ISS already is far behind schedule because of Russia 's failure to provide a key module .
Russia , in turn , is annoyed about a law signed by President Clinton this week that would cut U.S. payments to Russia for the ISS project if Russian companies are found to have helped Iran develop nuclear arms .
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called the new U.S. measure `` yet another attempt to give internal U.S. legislation an extraterritorial nature , which goes completely against international law . ''
