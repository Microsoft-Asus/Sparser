NEW YORK --
Vice President Al Gore , waging a two-city assault on the gun lobby and George W. Bush , suggested Thursday that the Texas governor is `` doing the bidding '' of the National Rifle Association .
Gore 's attack provided further evidence that Democrats plan to emphasize gun control , an issue that polling experts say could help close the double-digit poll lead Bush holds over Gore .
Gore took aim at the Republican presidential front-runner and the NRA in a speech to the national convention of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Later , he returned to Washington for a meeting with Colorado high school students lobbying for stricter gun controls .
The students , some from Littleton , where 16 people died in a rampage by two students this spring , earlier met with President Clinton at the White House .
Clinton called on the Republican -controlled Congress to pass gun control measures that were introduced by the administration immediately after the Littleton tragedy , and echoed the criticism Gore has leveled at the NRA throughout the week .
`` For the past three months the gun lobby has been calling the shots on Capitol Hill , '' Clinton said .
`` Now it 's time for Congress to listen to the lobbyists who truly matter -- our children . ''
In his speech to the NAACP , Gore used similar words in urging the delegates to support his presidential bid in order to `` create a family lobby that will be more powerful than the gun lobby . ''
But while the president directed his remarks mostly at Congress , the vice president set his sights largely on Bush 's support for state laws giving Texans the right to carry concealed weapons and prohibiting localities from suing gun manufacturers .
`` In this presidential race , there are some who believe the urgent matter related to guns is the need to extend new protections to the gun manufacturers .
I believe it is time to have new protections for our children and our families , '' Gore said .
`` Some want more concealed weapons .
But they ca n't conceal the fact that they are doing the bidding of the NRA . ''
Gore continued his habit of avoiding any direct mention of Bush by name .
But officials at the Democratic National Committee were not as subtle .
Rick Hess , the DNC 's designated hitter on the topic of Bush , noted that while the Colorado students were in Washington to push for stricter gun controls , Bush was at a fund-raising event in Virginia with NRA President Wayne LaPierre .
Polling experts say the parties ' contrasting positions on gun control could help the vice president draw closer to Bush in the polls .
`` It 's a different political world since Littleton , '' said Andrew Kohut , director of the Pew Research Center in Washington , a source of independent polling data .
While Kohut emphasized that he has no data related specifically to Bush , he noted that gun control has become `` an area of Republican vulnerability in general . ''
The Democratic message is `` you ca n't trust the Republicans because they are in the pocket of the NRA , '' he added .
And it seems to be working .
A Pew survey in mid- May found that 65 percent of Americans favor restrictions on gun ownership , an 8-point jump since late 1993 .
There were shifts of more than 10 points among women and people over 65 , two groups whose support Gore has been losing to Bush .

Kohut said his latest polling data , which is currently being analyzed , indicates support for gun controls `` is holding , '' particularly among women .
An overwhelming 75 percent of women now favor restricting the ownership of firearms .
A Gallup poll in mid- June showed even stronger support for gun control .
Nearly eight out of 10 Americans said they favored the registration of all firearms , a far-reaching step that the president and vice president have been unwilling to propose .
Although Gallup has not tested public opinion on the anti-crime proposals Gore unveiled Monday , Gallup researcher Michael Gillespie said previous polling suggests Americans `` are likely to support '' Gore 's call for photo licensing of gun owners .
However , Gillespie said Gallup data also suggests that Americans would not support the kind of class-action lawsuit the NAACP plans against the gun industry 's marketing practices .
Gore applauded the NAACP for considering such action .
