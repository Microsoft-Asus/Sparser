WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The State Department has suspended the security clearance of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk pending an investigation into alleged security violations , a State Department official said Saturday .</ENAMEX>
The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said there was `` no indication of espionage in this matter , '' and that Indyk has `` cooperated fully '' with investigators from the State Department and FBI .
`` At this time there has been no indication that any intelligence information has been compromised , '' the official said .
`` This is a question of security procedures that have not been followed . ''
Indyk , 49 , is barred from handling classified materials and must be escorted inside the State Department building .
State Department officials told The Washington Post the investigation involves `` sloppy handling of information '' over `` a longer period of time '' before Indyk took his position in Israel .
Indyk , who became a U.S. citizen in 1993 , has been ambassador to Israel from April 1995 to October 1997 and again since last year , the Post said in its Saturday editions .
The Post also reported a source outside the State Department familiar with the investigation as saying it relates to Indyk 's use of unclassified , government-owned laptop computers to prepare memorandums about discussions with foreign leaders while in transit .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright approved the suspension , State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told the Post .
`` She holds Ambassador Indyk in very high regard and values his contributions greatly , '' the spokesman said .
But , he said , `` she has been absolutely clear on the need for everyone to follow security procedures . ''
In a statement Friday , Indyk said : `` I regret that my trying to do best possible job under very difficult conditions has led to the temporary suspension of my security clearances while it is determined whether correct security procedures were followed . ''
Security officials at State decided to pull Indyk 's clearance on Sept. 12 , although no action was taken until Thursday .
Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested a briefing on Indyk on Tuesday after an anonymous phone caller told a committee aide the department was going to ignore security concerns about Indyk , the Post said .
Indyk 's suspension comes in the same week it was revealed that the Defense Department was investigating former CIA Director John Deutch for alleged security violations he committed while deputy secretary of defense .
Those alleged breaches also included the sloppy handling of secret data on personal computers and laptops .
Deutch admitted to security violations as CIA director after he retired ; he apologized and was stripped of his security clearance .
State Department officials have been extremely sensitive to security issues since the April disclosure that a laptop computer containing secret information about arms proliferation had vanished .
The suspension makes it virtually impossible for Indyk to do his job at a critical juncture in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians .
The Australian -born Indyk was named the senior Middle East specialist on the National Security Council in January 1993 .
In his first ambassadorship , he was an important conduit between the Clinton administration and the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin .
