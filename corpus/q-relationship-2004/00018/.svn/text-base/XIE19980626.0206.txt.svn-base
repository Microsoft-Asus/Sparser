SEOUL , June 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea said on Friday the submarine incident caused by the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- is `` a clear violation '' of its territorial waters and `` an infiltration '' violating the armistice and the inter- Korean basic relations agreements .
`` North Korea should admit the serious act of aggression , issue a responsible explanation and take steps to prevent such kind of recurrence , '' said Kang Joon -kwon , a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry in a statement .
As the submarine was on an espionage mission , Seoul will ask for a general-level meeting between the United States troops in South Korea and the DPRK to discuss the issue , said the spokesman .
Earlier today , a special investigation team of South Korean military authorities found nine crew dead inside the submarine .
Four of the crew had bullets in their heads and the other five had bullets in their bodies .
The team also found diving equipment , RPG -7 rocket artillery , an AK automatic rifle , South Korea -made canned beverage in the submarine and there was no sign of damage to the submarine 's interior .
The spokesman said it appeared that the crew disagreeed on what to do after being seized , believing that espionage agents killed other members before committing suicide under their head 's order .
The DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean navy Monday afternoon after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet in the East Sea -LRB- Sea of Japan -RRB- , some 11 miles off South Korean northeastern city Sokcho .
