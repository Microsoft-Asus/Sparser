The F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids produced in such crosses are called <span class="Emphasis2">monohybrids.</span> What would happen if he followed <span class="Emphasis1">two</span> characters at the same time? For instance, two of the seven characters Mendel studied were seed color and seed shape. Seeds may be either yellow or green. They also may be either round (smooth) or wrinkled. From single-character crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seeds is dominant (<span class="Emphasis1">Y</span>) and that the allele for green seeds is recessive (<span class="Emphasis1">y</span>). For the seed-shape character, the allele for round is dominant (<span class="Emphasis1">R</span>), and the allele for wrinkled is recessive (<span class="Emphasis1">r</span>). Imagine crossing two true-breeding pea varieties differing in <span class="Emphasis1">both</span> of these characters--a parental cross between a plant with yellow-round seeds (<span class="Emphasis1">YYRR</span>) and a plant with green-wrinkled seeds (<span class="Emphasis1">yyrr</span>). The F<SUB>1</SUB> plants will be <span class="Emphasis2">dihybrids,</span> heterozygous for both characters (<span class="Emphasis1">YyRr</span>). But are these two characters, seed color and seed shape, transmitted from parents to offspring as a package? Put another way, will the <span class="Emphasis1">Y</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> alleles always stay together, generation after generation? Or are seed color and seed shape inherited independently of each other? <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7</span> illustrates how a <span class="Emphasis1">dihybrid cross,</span> a cross between F<SUB>1</SUB> dihybrids, can determine which of these two hypotheses is correct.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig14-7','../fig/big/fig14-7.jpg','fig14-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig14-7.jpg" alt="fig14-7" name="myfig14-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 14-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Testing two hypotheses for segregation in a dihybrid cross.</span> A cross between true-breeding parent plants that differ in two characters produces F<SUB>1</SUB> plants that are <span class="Emphasis1">dihybrids:</span> They are heterozygous for both characters. The F<SUB>2</SUB> phenotypes show that the characters assort (segregate) independently. In this example, the two characters are seed color and seed shape.

The key step in the experiment is to see what happens when F<SUB>1</SUB> plants self-pollinate to produce F<SUB>2</SUB> offspring. If the hybrids must transmit their alleles in the same combinations in which they were inherited from the P generation, then there will only be two classes of gametes: <span class="Emphasis1">YR</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">yr.</span> This hypothesis predicts that the phenotypic ratio of the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation will be 3:1, just as in a cross between monohybrids (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7a</span>).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The alternative hypothesis is that the two pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other. In other words, genes are packaged into gametes in all possible allelic combinations, as long as each gamete has one allele for each gene. In our example, four classes of gametes would be produced in equal quantities: <span class="Emphasis1">YR, Yr, yR,</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">yr.</span> If sperm of four classes are mixed with ova of four classes, there will be 16 (4 &#160;X&#160; 4) equally probable ways in which the alleles can combine in the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation, as shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7b</span>. These combinations make up four phenotypic categories with a ratio of 9:3:3:1 (nine yellow-round to three green-round to three yellow-wrinkled to one green-wrinkled). When Mendel did the experiment and "scored" (classified) the F<SUB>2</SUB> offspring, he obtained a ratio of 315:108:101:32, which is approximately 9:3:3:1.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The experimental results supported the hypothesis that each character is independently inherited--that in the dihybrids (<span class="Emphasis1">YyRr</span>), the two alleles for seed color segregate independently of the two alleles for seed shape. Mendel tried his seven pea characters in various dihybrid combinations and always observed a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation. Notice in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7b</span>, however, that, if you consider the two characters separately, there is a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each: three yellow to one green; three round to one wrinkled. As far as a single character is concerned, the alleles segregate as if this were a monohybrid cross. The independent segregation of each pair of alleles during gamete formation is now called Mendel’s <span class="Emphasis2">law of independent assortment.</span></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
