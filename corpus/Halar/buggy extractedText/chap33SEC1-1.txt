 Phylum Porifera: Sponges are sessile with porous bodies and choanocytes



Of all the animals we will discuss, sponges (on branch Parazoa of the phylogenetic tree) represent the lineage closest to the colonial choanoflagellates that gave rise to the animal kingdom (see FIGURE 32.4). The cell layers of sponges are loose federations of cells, which are not really tissues because the cells are relatively unspecialized.
