WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Senators threatened Wednesday to bring `` legislative action '' against China unless the mainland agrees not to block Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization .
But they did n't say what the action might be .
As the bill to normalize trade with China went into its second day of debate by the full Senate , members of the Foreign Relations Committee held a separate hearing suggesting the bill might be amended to force China 's cooperation on the Taiwan issue .
`` I think ...
Congress ought to go ahead and do something , '' said committee chairman Sen. Jesse Helms , R - N.C. `` I think we ought to stand up for Taiwan now . ''
But Sen. Craig Thomas argued against an amendment to the China trade bill , saying it would delay passage .
`` I think we need to find a way to get that message '' to China without holding up the trade legislation , said the Wyoming Republican .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Senators were referring to Beijing 's proposal in late July that the document setting out terms for membership in the WTO make it clear Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau are all part of China -- in effect use the WTO to assert its disputed claim to Taiwan .
Beijing proposed that Taiwan be called `` a separate customs territory of China , '' said Sen. John Kyl , R - Ariz .</ENAMEX>
President Clinton told Kyl in an Aug. 31 letter made public at the hearing that his administration has warned China about the proposal .
`` We have advised the Chinese that such language is inappropriate ... and that we will not accept it , '' the letter said .
Senators said they were looking for ways to back the administration if China does n't withdraw its proposal .
`` We should hold out the prospect of legislative action , '' said Kyl .
Under an agreement signed in 1992 , once China joins the WTO , Taiwan would immediately follow .
Hong Kong is already a member as it is treated as a separate customs territory .
`` In a just world , '' Helms said , Taiwan would have been admitted long ago to the 137-member trade organization because it is more advanced economically than China and has for years met the requirements for membership .
China trade was the first order of business Tuesday as the Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders of both parties determined to approve the permanent normalized trade relations -LRB- PNTR -RRB- before lawmakers close shop to campaign before the November elections .
While supporters believe they have a solid majority in the Senate , they face two main problems -- time limitations as Congress rushes to finish its work for the year and the determination of some senators to link normalized trade to China 's record on weapons proliferation and human rights .
The House in May approved the China trade bill on a 237-197 vote , and the concern is that any Senate amendments to that bill would effectively kill it for the year because there would n't be time for the two chambers to work out differences between the measures .
As the full Senate debated the bill Wednesday , Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , urged support of the bill , saying rejection of PNTR will likely lead to an indefinite delay in Taiwan 's entry into the WTO .
-- The bill is H.R. 4444 .
