COLOMBO , January 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The past week has witnessed a peace effort by South Africa 's Nelson Mandela towards Sri Lanka 's civil war , an investigation into a Tamil billionaire , an allegation against Thailand and one of the navy 's biggest victories over the rebels at sea .
As the protracted civil war is dragging on between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- , as many as 15 international offers to mediate have been proposed , of which South African President Nelson Mandela 's offer was reportedly accepted .
Official sources said Monday the Sri Lankan government as well as the LTTE favored the Mandela intervention and South Africa 's foreign minister will be in Sri Lanka `` in due course '' to map out the basis on which South Africa could serve as the facilitator in bringing the two warring parties back to the negotiating table .
While the peace efforts are going on , the government is pressuring the LTTE rebels both economically as well as militarily .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Police said Tuesday that a Tamil billionaire businessman , considered to be a close friend of Tamil rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran </ENAMEX>, had been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department recently .
Sri Lankan police and the Interpol are investigating how the 36-year -old businessman had smuggled out of the country about 12 billion rupees -LRB- 200 million U.S. dollars -RRB- illegally in the past year .
They have found that the suspect had credited the illegally remitted funds to accounts of certain individuals and organizations in more than 950 banks all over the world , who might purchase arms for the LTTE .
The Sri Lankan government is fighting the civil war both domestically and internationally as the battle goes to the diplomatic front .
In a BBC World Service Radio `` Asia Today '' interview aired Tuesday , Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said : `` Some Thai ports have been used by known LTTE ships and coastal towns on the Thai border have been used as naval bases . ''
Press reports said both the Thai Foreign Ministry and the Thai army have denied that Tamil Tigers had used Thailand 's coastal areas as secret bases to ship weapons and ammunition to northern Sri Lanka .
But the Thai army chief Gen. Surayud Chulanont confirmed earlier that arms smugglers were using sea lanes in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea to ship war weapons from Cambodia and Myanmar to Sri Lanka .
Unnoticed by the rest of the country , the Sri Lanka Navy this week notched up one of its biggest victories at sea in a battle between Trincomalee and Mullaitivu northeast of the country .
At least 54 LTTE rebels were killed in the fighting , and a huge number of others , possibly more than 100 , were wounded .
Among those confirmed dead is Lt. Col. Keethan , the newly appointed Batticaloa area political wing leader of the LTTE .
Keethan is the highest ranking rebel leader to be killed in many months , analysts here said , adding that Lieutenant Colonel is the LTTE 's second highest rank .
But despite the victory in the fighting , which raged on the nights of January 7 , 8 and 11 , the navy has to face the fact that the LTTE rebels are fast arming themselves with smuggled equipment .
It has now been reported that on one of the 11 LTTE Sea Tiger craft which were sunk or put out of action was a 23 millimeter gun , a powerful weapon never seen before on a Tiger boat .
This 23 mm gun is not among the few which the Tigers captured from the navy in battles several years ago .
Military experts said it appears to have been manufactured in an East European country , which most probably means that the LTTE has managed to get at least one of its supply ships in without being caught .
This gun would have been part of a larger shipment , they noted .
Therefore , defense experts have strongly urged the government to strengthen the navy 's fleet , as well as to purchase more reconnaissance planes for the air force , to patrol the coastal areas .
As the civil war has been dragging on for 16 years , the eventful week seems to indicate that for all the efforts , the road to a lasting peace is by no means smooth .
