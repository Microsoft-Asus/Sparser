 Gunmen kill eight Iraqis in raid
Gunmen dressed in police uniforms have attacked a trading company in Baghdad, killing at least eight Iraqi employees.

The gunmen stormed the al-Ibtikar Trade Contracting Co in the capital's western Mansour district at 0815 (0515 GMT) and opened fire, police said.

The motive of the attack was not clear, as the gunmen did not take any money.

There have been a series of robberies and attacks on shops and businesses in Baghdad in the past week.

On Tuesday, nine people working at a foreign exchange and an electronics shop were kidnapped.

Sixteen employees of another trading company in Mansour were abducted the day before.
