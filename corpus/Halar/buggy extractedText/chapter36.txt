The algal ancestors of plants were completely immersed in water and dissolved minerals, and none of their cells were far from these ingredients. The evolutionary journey onto land involved the differentiation of the plant body into roots, which absorb water and minerals from soil, and shoots, which are exposed to light and atmospheric CO2. This body plan enabled plants to survive in an environment where chemical resources are divided between two media, soil and air. But the morphological solution to a dual environment posed a new problem: the need to transport materials between roots and shoots, sometimes over long distances. For example, the leaves of the eucalyptus trees in the photograph above are more than 100 m from the roots. These remote organs are bridged by vascular tissues that transport sap throughout the plant body. The mechanisms responsible for this internal transport are the subject of this chapter.

 Bulk flow functions in long-distance transport



Transport in plants occurs on three levels: (1) the uptake and loss of water and solutes by individual cells, such as the absorption of water and minerals from the soil by cells of a root; (2) short-distance transport of substances from cell to cell at the level of tissues and organs, such as the loading of sugar from photosynthetic cells of a mature leaf into the sieve tubes of phloem; and (3) long-distance transport of sap within xylem and phloem at the level of the whole plant. FIGURE 36.1 provides an overview of the major transport processes in whole plants.

 The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue



Water and mineral salts from soil enter the plant through the epidermis of roots, cross the root cortex, pass into the stele, and then flow up xylem vessels to the shoot system. In this section, we focus on the soil  epidermis  root cortex  xylem segments of this transport pathway. Use FIGURE 36.7 to reinforce the key concepts as you read this section.

Minerals are absorbed from the soil solution by the root surface, especially by root hairs and mycorrhizae (symbiotic associations of roots and fungi, not shown in this diagram). The water and minerals then move across the root cortex to the stele by a combination of the apoplastic and symplastic routes (see FIGURE 36.6).

 Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms



Xylem sap flows in a direction that generally does not allow it to function in exporting sugar from leaves to other parts of the plant. A second vascular tissue, the phloem, transports the organic products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. This transport of food in the plant is called translocation. In angiosperms, the specialized cells of phloem that function in translocation are the sieve-tube members, which are arranged end to end to form long sieve tubes. Between the cells are sieve plates, porous cross-walls that allow the flow of sap along the sieve tube (see FIGURE 35.9).

Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that differs markedly in composition from xylem sap. By far the prevalent solute in phloem sap is sugar, primarily the disaccharide sucrose in most plant species. The sucrose concentration may be as high as 30%  by weight, giving the sap a syrupy thickness. Phloem sap may also contain minerals, amino acids, and hormones in transit from one part of the plant to another.





 Transport at the cellular level depends on the selective permeability of membranes

The transport of solutes and water across biological membranes was covered in detail in Chapter 8. Here we reexamine a few of these transport processes in the specific context of plant cells.

The selective permeability of a plant cell's plasma membrane controls the movement of solutes between the cell and the extracellular solution. Recall from Chapter 8 that solutes tend to diffuse down their gradients, and when this occurs across a membrane, the process is termed passive transport--passive because it happens without the direct expenditure of metabolic energy by the cell. Most solutes, however, cross a membrane very slowly unless they can pass through transport proteins embedded in the membrane. Some of these facilitate diffusion by binding selectively to a solute on one side of the membrane and releasing the solute on the opposite side. Transfer of the solute across the membrane involves a conformational (shape) change by the transport protein. Other transport proteins function as selective channels, which are simply selective passageways across the membrane. For example, the membranes of most plant cells have potassium channels that allow potassium ions (K+) to pass, but not similar ions, such as sodium (Na+). Some channels are gated;that is, certain environmental or biochemical stimuli can cause the channels to open or close. Later in this chapter, we will see how gated K+ channels in the membranes of guard cells function in the opening and closing of stomata.

Recall also from Chapter 8 that active transport is the pumping of solutes across membranes against their electrochemical gradients, the combined effects of the solute's concentration gradient and the voltage (charge difference) across the membrane. It is termed active because the cell must expend metabolic energy, usually in the form of ATP, to transport a solute "uphill"--that is, counter to the direction in which the solute diffuses. Transport proteins that simply facilitate diffusion, such as selective channels, cannot perform active transport. The active transporters are a special class of membrane proteins, each responsible for pumping specific solutes.





 Proton pumps play a central role in transport across plant membranes

The most important active transporter in the plasma membranes of plant cells is the proton pump, which hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to pump hydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. This results in a proton gradient with a higher H+ concentration outside the cell than inside (FIGURE 36.2a). The gradient is a form of stored energy because the hydrogen ions tend to diffuse "downhill" back into the cell. And because the proton pump moves positive charge, in the form of H+, out of the cell, the pump also generates a membrane potential. Membrane potential is a voltage, a separation of opposite charges across a membrane. Proton pumping makes the inside of a plant cell negative in charge relative to the outside. This voltage is called a membrane potential because the charge separation is a form of potential (stored) energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work.

Fig 36-2. A chemiosmotic model of solute transport in plant cells.

Plant cells use energy stored in the proton gradient and membrane potential to drive the transport of many different solutes. For example, the membrane potential generated by proton pumps contributes to the uptake of potassium ions (K+) by root cells (FIGURE 36.2b). And in the mechanism called cotransport, a transport protein couples the downhill passage of one solute (H+) to the uphill passage of another (NO3-, in the case of FIGURE 36.2c). This "coattail" effect is also responsible for the uptake of the sugar sucrose by plant cells (FIGURE 36.2d). A membrane protein cotransports sucrose with the H+ that is moving down its gradient through the protein.

The role of proton pumps in the transport processes of plant cells is a specific application of the general mechanism called chemiosmosis (see FIGURE 9.15). The key feature of chemiosmosis is a transmembrane proton gradient, which links energy-releasing processes to energy-consuming processes in cells. For example, you learned in Chapters 9 and 10 that mitochondria and chloroplasts use proton gradients generated by electron transport chains (which release energy) to drive ATP synthesis (which consumes energy). The ATP synthases that couple H+ diffusion to ATP synthesis during cellular respiration and photosynthesis function somewhat like the proton pumps in the plasma membranes of plant cells. But in contrast to ATP synthases, proton pumps normally run in reverse, using ATP energy to pump H+ against its gradient. In both cases, proton gradients are the metabolic gears that enable one process to drive another. Chemiosmosis is a unifying principle of cellular energetics.





 Differences in water potential drive water transport in plant cells

The survival of plant cells depends on their ability to balance water uptake and loss. The net uptake or loss of water by a cell occurs by osmosis, the passive transport of water across a membrane (see FIGURE 8.11). How can we predict the direction of osmosis when a cell is surrounded by a particular solution? In the case of an animal cell, it is enough to know whether the extracellular solution is hypotonic (has a lower solute concentration) or hypertonic (has a higher solute concentration) relative to the cell; water will move by osmosis in the hypotonic  hypertonic direction. But in the case of a plant cell, the presence of a cell wall adds a second factor affecting osmosis: physical pressure. The combined effects of these two factors--solute concentration and pressure--are incorporated into a single measurement called water potential, abbreviated by the Greek letter psi (y).

The most important thing for you to learn about water potential is that water will move across a membrane from the solution with the higher water potential to the solution with the lower water potential. For example, if a plant cell is immersed in a solution having a higher water potential than the cell, osmotic uptake of the water will cause the cell to swell. By moving, water can perform work (expanding a cell, for instance). The potential in water potential refers to this potential energy, the capacity to perform work when water moves from a region of higher y to a region of lower y. It is a special case of the general tendency of systems to change spontaneously to a state of lowest free energy (see FIGURE 6.5).

Plant biologists measure y in units of pressure called megapascals (abbreviated MPa), where 1 MPa is equal to about 10 atmospheres of pressure. (An atmosphere is the pressure exerted at sea level by an imaginary column of air--about 1 kg of pressure per square centimeter.) A couple of nonbiological examples will give you some idea of the magnitude of a megapascal: A car tire is usually inflated to a pressure of about 0.2 MPa; the water pressure in home plumbing is about 0.25 MPa.

How Solutes and Pressure Affect Water Potential

Let's see how solute concentration and pressure affect water potential. For purposes of comparison, the water potential of pure water in a container open to the atmosphere is zero (y = 0 MPa). The addition of solutes lowers the water potential. This is because the water molecules that form shells around a solute have less freedom to move than they do in pure water. Because y is standardized as 0 MPa for pure water, any solution at atmospheric pressure has a negative water potential owing to the presence of solutes. For instance, a 0.1-molar (M) solution of any solute has a water potential of -20.23 MPa. If this solution is separated from pure water by a selectively permeable membrane, water will move by osmosis into the solution, from the region of higher y (0 MPa) to the region of lower y (-20.23 MPa). But to predict the direction of water movement, we also have to consider the influence of physical pressure on y.

In contrast to the inverse relationship of y to solute concentration, water potential is directly proportional to pressure; increasing pressure raises y. Remember that y measures the relative tendency for water to leave one location in favor of another. Physical pressure--pressing the plunger of a syringe filled with water, for example--causes water to escape via any available exit. If a solution is separated from pure water by a selectively permeable membrane, external pressure on the solution can counter its tendency to take up water due to the presence of solutes. In fact, even greater pressure will force water across the membrane from the solution to the compartment containing pure water. It is also possible to create a negative pressure, or tension, on water or solutions. For example, if you pull up on the plunger of a syringe, the negative pressure within the syringe draws a solution through the needle.

Quantitative Analysis of Water Potential

The combined effects of pressure and solute concentration on water potential are incorporated into the following equation:  where yP is the pressure potential (physical pressure on a solution) and yS is the solute potential, which is proportional to the solute concentration of a solution. (yS is also called osmotic potential.)

Let's see how this equation works with the help of FIGURE 36.3. A 0.1 M solution has a yS of -20.23 MPa. Thus, in the absence of a physical pressure (yP = 0), water potential, as stated earlier, is -20.23 MPa for a 0.1 M solution:  Water would move into this solution from a compartment of pure water separated from the solution by a selectively permeable membrane (FIGURE 36.3a). But if we now apply a physical pressure of +10.23 MPa to this solution, we raise its water potential from a negative value to 0 MPa (y = 0.23 -0.23). There will now be no net flow of water between this pressurized solution and the compartment of water (FIGURE 36.3b). In fact, if we increase yP to +10.3 MPa, then the solution has a water potential of +10.07 MPa (y = 0.3 - 0.23), and this solution will actually lose water to a compartment containing pure water (FIGURE 36.3c). Finally, imagine using a plunger to pull upward on the water instead of pushing downward on the solution. A negative pressure (tension) of -0.3 MPa on the water compartment would be sufficient to draw water from the solution, which has a water potential of -0.23 MPa (FIGURE 36.3d). In dissecting water potential to see these opposing effects of pressure and solutes, it is important to remember the key point: Water will move across a membrane in the direction of lower (more negative) water potential.

Fig 36-3. Water potential and water movement: a mechanical model. In this U-shaped apparatus, a selectively permeable membrane separates pure water from a 0.1 molar (M) solution containing a particular solute that cannot pass freely across the membrane. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from where water potential is higher to where it is lower. The water potential (y) of pure water at atmospheric pressure is 0 MPa. If we know the values of pressure potential (yP) and solute potential (yS), we can calculate water potential: (y = yP + yS). The values for y and yS in the left and right arms of the U-tube are given for initial conditions, before any net movement of water. (a) The addition of solutes reduces water potential (to a negative value). (b, c) Application of physical pressure increases water potential. (d) A negative pressure (tension) decreases water potential.

Let's now apply what we have learned about water potential to the uptake and loss of water by plant cells. First, imagine a flaccid cell, one that has a yP of 0 and is therefore not firm. Let's bathe this flaccid cell in a solution of higher solute concentration than the cell itself (FIGURE 36.4a). Since the external solution has the lower (more negative) water potential, water will leave the cell by osmosis, and the cell will plasmolyze, or shrink and pull away from its wall. Now let's place the same flaccid cell in pure water (y =0; FIGURE 36.4b). The cell has a lower water potential because of the presence of solutes, and water enters the cell by osmosis. The cell begins to swell and push against the wall, producing a turgor pressure. The partially elastic wall pushes back against the pressurized cell. When this wall pressure is great enough to offset the tendency for water to enter because of the solutes in the cell, then yP and yS are equal in magnitude and thus y -0. This matches the water potential of the extracellular environment--in this example, 0 MPa. A dynamic equilibrium has been reached, and there is no further net movement of water, although an equal exchange of water across the membrane continues.

(The protoplasts of flaccid cells are in contact with their walls but lack turgor pressure.) The blue arrows indicate the initial direction of water movement.

In contrast to a flaccid cell, a walled cell that has a greater solute concentration than its surroundings will be turgid, referring to the turgor pressure that keeps it firm. Healthy plant cells are turgid most of the time. Their turgor contributes to support in nonwoody parts of the plant. You can see the consequences of turgor loss in a wilted tomato plant, which has flaccid cells (FIGURE 36.5).

 Aquaporins affect the rate of water transport across membranes

We have been examining water potential as the force that moves water across the membranes of plant cells, but how do the water molecules actually cross the membranes? Because water molecules are so small, they move relatively freely across the lipid bilayer of membranes, even though the middle zone of that bilayer is hydrophobic (see FIGURE 8.1). Until recently, most biologists accepted the hypothesis that leakage of water across the lipid bilayer was enough to account for water fluxes across membranes. That hypothesis was challenged in the early 1990s, when careful measurements indicated that water transport across biological membranes is too specific and too rapid to be explained entirely by diffusion through the lipid bilayer. This observation suggested the possibility of selective channels for water, and such channels have since been discovered in the membranes of both plant and animal cells.

These specific channels for passive traffic of water are transport proteins called aquaporins. Aquaporins do not affect the water potential gradient or the direction of water flow, but rather the rate at which water diffuses down its water potential gradient. The existence of aquaporins raises the possibility that a cell can regulate the rate of water uptake or loss when it has a water potential different from that of its surroundings. Aquaporins may form gated channels that open and close in response to variables such as turgor pressure of the cell. Many laboratories are now investigating how aquaporins work, and this research is likely to increase our understanding of how the cells of plants and other organisms regulate water balance.





 Vacuolated plant cells have three major compartments

Outside the protoplast of a plant cell is a thick cell wall that helps maintain the cell's shape (see FIGURES 7.8 and 35.10). The cell wall itself, however, does not play a direct role in regulating the traffic of molecules into and out of the protoplast; that is the role of the selectively permeable plasma membrane. The plasma membrane serves as a barrier between two major compartments: the cell wall and the cytosol (the part of the cytoplasm contained within the plasma membrane but outside the intracellular organelles). Most mature plant cells have a third major compartment, the vacuole, a large organelle that can occupy as much as 90%  of the protoplast's volume (FIGURE 36.6a). The membrane that bounds the vacuole, the tonoplast, regulates molecular traffic between the cytosol and the vacuolar contents, called cell sap. For example, the tonoplast has proton pumps that expel H+ from the cytosol into the vacuole. This augments the ability of the proton pumps of the plasma membrane to maintain a low cytosolic concentration of H+.

Fig 36-6. Compartments of plant cells and tissues and routes for lateral transport. (a) The cell wall, cytosol, and vacuole are the three main compartments of most mature plant cells. Specific transport proteins embedded in the plasma membrane and tonoplast regulate traffic of molecules between the three compartments. (b) At the tissue level, there are two compartments, the symplast and the apoplast. This anatomy provides three routes for lateral transport in a plant tissue or organ. In this diagram, substances seem confined to one of the three routes; in fact, substances may transfer from one route to another during their commute across an organ.

In most plant tissues, two of the three cellular compartments are continuous from cell to cell. Plasmodesmata connect the cytosolic compartments of neighboring cells, forming a continuous pathway for transport of certain molecules between cells. This cytoplasmic continuum is called the symplast (see FIGURE 36.6). The walls of adjacent plant cells are also in contact, forming a second compartment at the tissue level. This compartment, the continuum of cell walls, is called the apoplast. The third cellular compartment, the vacuole, is not shared with neighboring cells.





 Both the symplast and the apoplast function in transport within tissues and organs

How do water and solutes move from one location to another within plant tissues and organs? For example, what mechanisms transport water and minerals absorbed by a root from the outer cells to the inner cells of the root? Such short-distance transport is sometimes called lateral transport because its usual direction is along the radial axis of plant organs, rather than up and down along the length of the plant.

Three routes are available for lateral transport (FIGURE 36.6b). By the first route, substances move out of one cell, across the cell wall, and into the neighboring cell, which may then pass the substances along to the next cell in the pathway by the same mechanism. This transmembrane route requires repeated crossings of plasma membranes, as the solutes exit one cell and enter the next.

The second route, via the symplast, the continuum of cytosol within a plant tissue, requires only one crossing of a plasma membrane. After entering one cell, solutes and water can then move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata.

The third route for lateral transport within a plant tissue or organ is along the apoplast, the extracellular pathway consisting of cell walls and extracellular spaces. Before ever entering a cell, water and solutes can move from one location to another within a root or other organ along the byways provided by the continuum of cell walls.





 Bulk flow functions in long-distance transport

Diffusion in a solution is fairly efficient for transport over distances of cellular dimensions (less than 100 mm), but it is much too slow to function in long-distance transport within a plant--for example, in the transport of water and minerals from roots to leaves. Water and solutes move through xylem vessels and sieve tubes by bulk flow, the movement of a fluid driven by pressure. In phloem, for example, hydrostatic pressure is generated at one end of a sieve tube, forcing sap to the opposite end of the tube. In xylem, it is actually tension (negative pressure) that drives long-distance transport. Transpiration, the evaporation of water from a leaf, reduces pressure in the leaf xylem. This creates a tension that pulls xylem sap upward from the roots.

If you have ever dealt with a partially clogged drain, you know that the rate of flow through a pipe depends on the pipe's internal diameter. Clogs reduce flow because they reduce the effective diameter of the drainpipe. Such household experiences help us understand how the unusual structures of plant cells specialized for bulk flow--sieve-tube members of the phloem and vessel elements and tracheids of the xylem--fit their function. Recall from Chapter 35 that sieve-tube members are almost entirely devoid of internal organelles and that vessel elements and tracheids are dead at maturity. Like unplugging a kitchen drain, the developmental loss of cytoplasmic content in a plant's "plumbing" allows for the efficient bulk flow of materials through the conduits formed by the specialized cells. The porous plates that connect contiguous sieve-tube members (see FIGURE 35.9) and the perforated end walls of xylem vessel elements (see FIGURE 35.8) also enhance bulk flow.

Now that we have an overview of the basic mechanisms of transport at the cellular, tissue, and whole-plant levels, we are ready to take a closer look at how these mechanisms work together in the overall transport functions that enable a plant to survive on land. For example, bulk flow due to a pressure difference is the mechanism of long-distance transport of phloem sap, but it is active transport of sugar at the cellular level that maintains this pressure difference. The four transport functions we will examine in more detail are the absorption of water and minerals by roots, the ascent of xylem sap, the control of transpiration, and the transport of organic nutrients within phloem.





 Root hairs, mycorrhizae, and a large surface area of cortical cells enhance water and mineral absorption

Much of the absorption of water and minerals occurs near root tips, where the epidermis is permeable to water and where root hairs are located. Root hairs, which are extensions of epidermal cells, account for much of the surface area of roots (see FIGURE 35.14). Soil particles, which are usually coated with water and dissolved minerals, adhere tightly to the hairs. The soil solution flows into the hydrophilic walls of epidermal cells and passes freely along the apoplast into the root cortex. This exposes all the parenchyma cells of the cortex to soil solution, providing a much greater surface area of membrane than the surface area of the epidermis alone.

As the soil solution moves along the apoplast into the roots, cells of the epidermis and cortex take up water and certain solutes into the symplast. The soil solution is usually very dilute, and roots can accumulate essential minerals to concentrations that are hundreds of times higher than the concentrations of these minerals in soil. For example, selective transport proteins of the plasma membrane and tonoplast enable root cells to extract K+, an essential mineral nutrient. In contrast, the cells exclude most Na+, which may be much more concentrated than K+ in the soil solution.

In their essential business of absorbing water and minerals from the soil, most plants are not on their own but have partners in the form of symbiotic fungi. "Infected" roots form mycorrhizae, symbiotic structures consisting of the plant's roots united with the hyphae (filaments) of the fungi (FIGURE 36.8). The hyphae absorb water and selected minerals, transferring much of these resources to the host plant. Chapter 37 highlights the role of mycorrhizae in the mineral nutrition of plants, and Chapter 31 featured the fungal partners in these mutualistic relationships. What is important to understand here is that the mycelium (network of hyphae) of the fungus endows mycorrhizae with an enormous surface area for absorption of water and minerals. As much as 3 m of hyphae can extend from each centimeter along the length of a root, reaching a far greater volume of soil than the root alone could penetrate. Mycorrhizae enable even older regions of roots, far from the abundance of root hairs near the root tips, to supply water and minerals to the plant.

 The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue

Water and minerals that pass from the soil into the root cortex cannot be transported to the rest of the plant until they enter the xylem of the stele. The endodermis, the innermost layer of cells in the root cortex, surrounds the stele and functions as a last checkpoint for the selective passage of minerals from the cortex into the vascular tissue (see FIGURE 36.7). Minerals already in the symplast when they reach the endodermis continue through the plasmodesmata of the endodermal cells and pass into the stele. These minerals were already screened by the selective membrane they had to cross to enter the symplast in the epidermis or cortex. Those minerals that reach the endodermis via the apoplast encounter a dead end that blocks their passage into the stele: In the wall of each endodermal cell is the Casparian strip, a belt made of suberin, a waxy material that is impervious to water and dissolved minerals. Thus, water and minerals cannot cross the endodermis and enter vascular tissue via the apoplast. The only way past this barrier is for the water and minerals to cross the plasma membrane of an endodermal cell and enter the stele via the symplast. The endodermis, with its Casparian strip, ensures that no minerals can reach the vascular tissue of the root without crossing a selectively permeable plasma membrane. If minerals do not enter cells in the cortex, they must enter endodermal cells or be excluded from the vascular tissue. The structure of the endodermis and its strategic location in the root fit its function as sentry of the cortex-stele border, a function that contributes to the ability of roots to preferentially transport certain minerals from the soil into the xylem.

The last segment in the soil  xylem pathway is the passage of water and minerals into the tracheids and vessel elements of the xylem. These water-conducting cells lack protoplasts, and thus the lumen of these cells and the cell walls are part of the apoplast. Endodermal cells as well as parenchyma cells within the stele discharge minerals into their walls. Both diffusion and active transport are probably involved in this transfer of solutes from symplast to apoplast, and the water and minerals are now free to enter the tracheids and xylem vessels. The water and mineral nutrients we have tracked from the soil to root xylem can now be transported upward as xylem sap to the shoot system.





 The ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on transpiration and the physical properties of water

Xylem sap rises against gravity, without the help of any mechanical pump, to reach heights of more than 100 m in the tallest trees. Is the sap pushed upward from the roots, or is it pulled upward from the leaves? Let's evaluate the relative contributions of these two possible mechanisms.

Pushing Xylem Sap: Root Pressure

At night, when transpiration is very low or zero, the root cells are still expending energy to pump mineral ions into the xylem. The endodermis surrounding the stele of the root helps prevent the leakage of these ions back out of the stele. The accumulation of minerals in the stele lowers water potential there. Water flows in from the root cortex, generating a positive pressure that forces fluid up the xylem. This upward push of xylem sap is called root pressure.

Root pressure causes guttation, the exudation of water droplets that can be seen in the morning on tips of grass blades or the leaf margins of some small, herbaceous (nonwoody) dicots. During the night, when the rate of transpiration is low, the roots of some plants keep accumulating minerals, and root pressure pushes xylem sap into the shoot system. More water enters leaves than is transpired, and the excess is forced out as guttation fluid (FIGURE 36.9).

Fig 36-9. Guttation. Root pressure is forcing excess water from this strawberry leaf.

In most plants, root pressure is not the major mechanism driving the ascent of xylem sap. At most, root pressure can force water upward only a few meters, and many plants generate no root pressure at all. Even in plants that display guttation, root pressure cannot keep pace with transpiration after sunrise. For the most part, xylem sap is not pushed from below by root pressure but pulled upward by the leaves themselves.

Pulling Xylem Sap: The Transpiration-Cohesion-Tension Mechanism

If we want to move solid material upward, we can either push it from below or pull it from above. It is less obvious that something as seemingly fluid as water could be pulled up a pipe. Nevertheless, that is what happens in the xylem vessels of plants. As we investigate this mechanism of transport, we will see that transpiration provides the pull, and the cohesion of water due to hydrogen bonding transmits the upward pull along the entire length of the xylem to the roots.

Transpirational Pull.Stomata, the microscopic pores on the surface of a leaf, lead to a maze of internal air spaces that expose the mesophyll cells to the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis. The air in these spaces is saturated with water vapor because it is in contact with the moist walls of the cells. On most days, the air outside the leaf is drier; that is, it has a lower water concentration than the air inside the leaf. Therefore, gaseous water, diffusing down its concentration gradient, exits the leaf via the stomata. It is this loss of water vapor from the leaf that we call transpiration.

How is transpiration translated into a pulling force for the movement of water in a plant? The mechanism depends on the generation of a negative pressure (tension) in the leaf due to the unique physical properties of water. Evaporation from the thin film of water that coats the mesophyll cells replaces the water vapor that is lost from the leaf's air spaces by transpiration. As water evaporates, the remaining film of liquid water retreats into the pores of the cell walls, attracted by adhesion to the hydrophilic walls (FIGURE 36.10). At the same time, cohesive forces in the water resist an increase in the surface area of the film (a surface-tension effect; see Chapter 3). The combination of the two forces acting on the water -- adhesion to the wall and surface tension -- causes the surface of the water film to form a meniscus, or concave shape. In a sense, the water is being "pulled on" by the adhesive and cohesive forces. Thus, the water film at the surface of leaf cells has a negative pressure, a pressure less than atmospheric pressure. And the more concave the meniscus, the more negative the pressure of the water film. This negative pressure, or tension, is the pulling force that draws water out of the leaf xylem, through the mesophyll, and toward the cells and surface film bordering the air spaces near stomata.

Fig 36-10. The generation of transpirational pull in a leaf. Water vapor diffuses from the moist air spaces of the leaf to the drier air outside via stomata. Evaporation from the water film coating the mesophyll cells maintains the high humidity of the air spaces. This loss of water causes the water film to form menisci that become more and more concave as the rate of transpiration increases. A meniscus has a tension that is inversely proportional to the radius of the curved water surface. Thus, as the water film recedes and its menisci become more concave, the tension of the water film increases. Tension is a negative pressure--a force that pulls water from locations where hydrostatic pressure is greater. The tension of water lining the air spaces of the leaf is the physical basis of transpirational pull, which draws water out of xylem.

This mechanism of water flow fits with what you learned earlier about water potential. In the equation for water potential, a tension (negative pressure) lowers the potential. And since water moves from where its potential is higher to where it is lower, mesophyll cells will lose water to the surface film lining air spaces, which in turn loses water by transpiration. The water lost via the stomata is replaced by water that is pulled out of the leaf xylem. The negative water potential of leaves provides the "pull" in transpirational pull.

Cohesion and Adhesion in the Ascent of Xylem Sap.The transpirational pull on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips and even into the soil solution (FIGURE 36.11). The cohesion of water due to hydrogen bonding makes it possible to pull a column of sap from above without the water separating. Water molecules exiting the xylem in the leaf tug on adjacent water molecules, and this pull is relayed, molecule by molecule, down the entire column of water in the xylem. Also helping to fight gravity is the strong adhesion of water molecules (again by hydrogen bonds) to the hydrophilic walls of the xylem cells. The very small diameter of tracheids and vessel elements exposes a large proportion of the water to the hydrophilic walls, thus enhancing adhesion in overcoming the downward force of gravity.

Fig 36-11. Ascent of water in a tree. Hydrogen bonding forms an unbroken chain of water molecules extending from leaves all the way to the soil. The force that drives the ascent of xylem sap is a gradient of water potential (y). For the bulk flow over long distance, the y gradient is due mainly to a gradient of the pressure potential (yP). Transpiration results in the yP at the leaf end of xylem being lower than the yP at the root end.

The upward pull on the cohesive sap creates tension within the xylem. Pressure will cause an elastic pipe to swell, but tension will pull the walls of the pipe inward. You can actually measure a decrease in the diameter of a tree trunk on a warm day, when transpirational pull puts the xylem under tension. The rings of secondary walls prevent xylem vessels from collapsing, much as wire rings maintain the shape of a vacuum hose. Transpirational pull puts the xylem under tension all the way down to the root tips, even in the tallest trees. This tension lowers water potential in the root xylem to such an extent that water flows passively from the soil, across the root cortex, and into the stele.

Transpirational pull can extend down to the roots only through an unbroken chain of water molecules. Cavitation, the formation of a water vapor pocket in a xylem vessel, such as when xylem sap freezes in winter, breaks the chain. Small plants can use root pressure to refill xylem vessels in spring, but in trees, root pressure cannot push water to the top, so a vessel with a water vapor pocket can never function as a water pipe again. However, the transpiration stream can detour around the water vapor pocket through pits between adjacent xylem vessels, and secondary growth adds a layer of new xylem vessels each year. In some angiosperm trees, including oaks and elms, the youngest, outermost growth ring of xylem transports most of the water. The older xylem functions to support the tree (see Chapter 35).





 Xylem sap ascends by solar-powered bulk flow: a review

The transpiration-cohesion-tension mechanism that transports xylem sap against gravity is an excellent example of how physical principles apply to biological problems. Long-distance transport of water from roots to leaves occurs by bulk flow, the movement of fluid driven by a pressure difference at opposite ends of a conduit. In a plant, the conduits are xylem vessels or chains of tracheids. The pressure difference is generated at the leaf end by transpirational pull, which lowers pressure (increases tension) at the "upstream" end of the xylem.

On a smaller scale, gradients of water potential drive the osmotic movement of water from cell to cell within root and leaf tissue (see FIGURE 36.11). Differences in both solute concentration and pressure contribute to this microscopic transport. In contrast, bulk flow, the mechanism for long-distance transport up xylem vessels, depends only on pressure. Another contrast with osmosis, which moves only water, is that bulk flow moves the whole solution, water plus minerals and any other solutes dissolved in the water.

The plant expends none of its own metabolic energy to lift xylem sap up to the leaves by bulk flow. The absorption of sunlight drives transpiration by causing water to evaporate from the moist walls of mesophyll cells and by maintaining a high humidity in the air spaces within a leaf. Thus, the ascent of xylem sap is ultimately solar powered.





 Guard cells mediate the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise

A leaf may transpire more than its weight in water each day. Leaves are kept from wilting by a transpiration stream in xylem vessels that flows as fast as 75 cm/min, about the speed of the tip of a second hand sweeping around a wall clock. A plant's tremendous requirement for water is part of the cost of making food by photosynthesis. Guard cells, by controlling the size of stomata, help balance the plant's need to conserve water with its requirement for photosynthesis (FIGURE 36.12).

The Photosynthesis-Transpiration Compromise

To make food, a plant must spread its leaves to the sun and obtain CO2 from the air. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaf through the stomata, and oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis diffuses out of the leaf via the stomata (see FIGURE 36.10). Upon diffusing through the stomata, CO2 enters a honeycomb of air spaces formed by the irregularly shaped spongy parenchyma cells (see FIGURE 35.11). Because of the irregular shape of these cells, the internal surface area of the leaf may be 10 to 30 times greater than the external surface area we see when we look at the leaf. This structural feature of leaves supports photosynthesis by increasing exposure to CO2, but it also increases the surface area for the evaporation of water, which exits the plant freely through open stomata. About 90%  of the water a plant loses escapes through stomata, though these pores account for only 1-2%  of the external leaf surface. The waxy cuticle limits water loss through the remaining surface of the leaf.

One way to evaluate how efficiently a plant uses water is to determine its transpiration-to-photosynthesis ratio, the amount of water lost per gram of CO2 assimilated into organic material by photosynthesis. For many plant species, this ratio is about 600:1, meaning the plant transpires 600 g of water for each gram of CO2 that becomes incorporated into carbohydrate. However, corn and other plants that assimilate atmospheric CO2 by the C4 pathway have transpiration-to-photosynthesis ratios of 300:1 or less. With the same concentration of CO2 within the air spaces of the leaf, C4 plants can assimilate that CO2 at a greater rate than C3 plants can (see Chapter 10). Because water loss is the trade-off for allowing CO2 to diffuse into the leaf, the photosynthetic return for each gram of water sacrificed is greater for C4 plants, which can assimilate CO2 faster than C3 plants when stomata are partially closed.

In addition to supplying water to leaves, the transpiration stream assists in the delivery of minerals and other substances from the roots to the shoots and leaves. Transpiration also results in evaporative cooling, which can lower the temperature of a leaf by as much as 10-15&#176;C compared with the surrounding air. This prevents the leaf from reaching temperatures that could denature various enzymes involved in photosynthesis and other metabolic processes. Cacti and other desert succulents, which have low rates of transpiration, can tolerate high leaf temperatures; in this case, the loss of water due to transpiration is a greater threat than overheating.

When transpiration exceeds the delivery of water by xylem, as when the soil begins to dry out, the leaves begin to wilt as their cells lose turgor pressure (see FIGURE 36.5). The potential rate of transpiration will be greatest on a day that is sunny, warm, dry, and windy, because these are the environmental factors that increase the evaporation of water. Plants are not helpless against the elements, however, for they are capable of adjusting to their environment. In the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise, mechanisms that regulate the size of the stomatal openings strike a balance.

How Stomata Open and Close

Each stoma is flanked by a pair of guard cells, which are kidney-shaped in dicots and dumbbell-shaped in monocots. The guard cells are suspended by their epidermal neighbors over an air chamber, which leads to a honeycomb of air spaces.

Guard cells control the diameter of the stoma by changing shape, thereby widening or narrowing the gap between the two cells (FIGURE 36.13a). When guard cells take in water by osmosis, they become more turgid and swell. In most dicots, the cell walls of guard cells are not uniformly thick, and the cellulose microfibrils are oriented in a direction that causes the guard cells to buckle outward when they are turgid. This increases the size of the gap between the cells. When the cells lose water and become flaccid, they become less bowed and close the space between them. This basic mechanism also applies to the stomata of monocots.

Guard cells of a dicot are illustrated in their turgid (stoma open) and flaccid (stoma closed) states. The pair of guard cells buckle outward when turgid. Cellulose microfibrils in the walls resist stretching and compression in the direction parallel to the microfibrils. Thus, the radial orientation of the microfibrils causes the cells to increase in length more than width when turgor increases. The two guard cells are attached at their tips, so the increase in length causes buckling. (b) Role of potassium in stomatal opening and closing. The transport of K+ (potassium ions) across the plasma membrane and tonoplast causes the turgor changes of guard cells. Stomata open when guard cells accumulate potassium (red dots), which lowers the cells' water potential and causes them to take up water by osmosis. The cells become turgid. An exodus of K+ from guard cells causes stomatal closure.

The changes in turgor pressure that open and close stomata result primarily from the reversible uptake and loss of potassium ions (K+) by the guard cells. Stomata open when guard cells actively accumulate K+ from neighboring epidermal cells (FIGURE 36.13b). This uptake of solute causes the water potential to become more negative within the guard cells, and the cells become more turgid as water enters by osmosis. Most of the K+ and water are stored in the vacuole, and thus the tonoplast also plays a role. Stomatal closing results from an exodus of K+ from guard cells, which leads to an osmotic loss of water. Regulation of aquaporins may also be involved in the swelling and shrinking of guard cells by varying the permeability of the membranes to water.

The K+ fluxes across the guard cell membrane are probably passive, being coupled to the generation of membrane potentials by proton pumps. Stomatal opening correlates with active transport of H+ out of the guard cell. The resulting voltage (membrane potential) drives K+ into the cell through specific membrane channels (see FIGURE 36.2). Plant physiologists are using a method called patch clamping to study regulation of the guard cell's proton pumps and K+ channels (FIGURE 36.14).

Fig 36-14. A patch-clamp study of guard cell membranes. Patch clamping makes it possible to isolate a very tiny "patch" of membrane and study ion movement through a single type of channel--K+ or H+ channels, for instance. This particular experiment measures the effect of blue light, which increases H+ current across the membrane. Along with other evidence, patch-clamp studies support the hypothesis that blue light and other stimuli regulate guard cells by affecting the proton (H+) pumps of the membrane.

In general, stomata are open during the day and closed at night. This prevents the plant from needlessly losing water when it is too dark for photosynthesis. At least three cues contribute to stomatal opening at dawn. First, light itself stimulates guard cells to accumulate potassium and become turgid. This response is triggered by the illumination of a blue-light receptor in a guard cell, perhaps built into the plasma membrane. Activation of these blue-light receptors stimulates the activity of ATP-powered proton pumps in the plasma membrane of the guard cells, which in turn promotes the uptake of K+ (see FIGURE 36.14). Light may also stimulate stomatal opening by driving photosynthesis in guard cell chloroplasts, making ATP available for the active transport of hydrogen ions. (Guard cells are the only epidermal cells equipped with chloroplasts.)

A second stimulus causing stomata to open is depletion of CO2 within air spaces of the leaf, which occurs when photosynthesis begins in the mesophyll. We can actually trick a plant into opening its stomata at night by placing it in a chamber devoid of CO2.

A third cue in stomatal opening is an internal clock located in the guard cells. Even if you keep a plant in a dark closet, stomata will continue their daily rhythm of opening and closing. All eukaryotic organisms have internal clocks that somehow keep track of time and regulate cyclic processes. Cycles that have intervals of approximately 24 hours are called circadian rhythms. You will learn more about circadian rhythms and the biological clocks that control them in Chapter 39.

Environmental stresses of various kinds can cause stomata to close during the daytime. When the plant is suffering a water deficiency, guard cells may lose turgor. In addition, a hormone called abscisic acid, which is produced in the mesophyll cells in response to water deficiency, signals guard cells to close stomata. This response reduces further wilting, but it also slows down photosynthesis; this is one reason droughts reduce crop yields. High temperatures also induce stomatal closure, probably by stimulating cellular respiration and increasing CO2 concentration within the air spaces of the leaf. High temperature and excessive transpiration may combine to cause stomata to close briefly during mid-day. Thus, guard cells arbitrate the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise on a moment-to-moment basis by integrating a variety of internal and external stimuli.





 Xerophytes have evolutionary adaptations that reduce transpiration

Plants adapted to arid climates, called xerophytes, have various leaf modifications that reduce the rate of transpiration. Many xerophytes have small, thick leaves, an adaptation that limits water loss by reducing surface area relative to leaf volume. A thick cuticle gives some of these leaves a leathery consistency. The stomata are concentrated on the lower (shady) leaf surface, and they are often located in depressions that shelter the pores from the dry wind (FIGURE 36.15). During the driest months, some desert plants shed their leaves. Others, such as cacti, subsist on water the plant stores in its fleshy stems during the rainy season. (These modified stems are the photosynthetic organs of cacti; the spines are modified leaves.)

Fig 36-15. Structural adaptations of a xerophyte leaf. Oleander (inset) is commonly planted along desert highways. The leaves have a thick cuticle and multiple-layered dermal tissue that reduce water loss. Stomata are recessed in "crypts," an adaptation that reduces the rate of transpiration by protecting the stomata from hot, dry wind. The trichomes ("hairs") also help minimize transpiration by breaking up the flow of air, allowing the chamber of the crypt to have a higher humidity than the surrounding atmosphere (LM).

One of the most elegant adaptations to arid habitats is found in ice plants and other succulent plants of the family Crassulaceae and in representatives of many other plant families. These plants assimilate CO2 by an alternative photosynthetic pathway known as CAM, for crassulacean acid metabolism (see FIGURE 10.19). Mesophyll cells in a CAM plant have enzymes that can incorporate CO2 into organic acids during the night. During the daytime, the organic acids are broken down to release CO2 in the same cells, and sugars are synthesized by the conventional (C3) photosynthetic pathway. Because the leaf takes in its CO2 at night, the stomata can close during the day, when transpiration is most severe.





 Phloem translocates its sap from sugar sources to sugar sinks

In contrast to the unidirectional transport of xylem sap from roots to leaves, the direction that phloem sap travels is variable. The one generalization that holds is that sieve tubes carry food from a sugar source to a sugar sink. A sugar source is a plant organ in which sugar is being produced by either photosynthesis or the breakdown of starch. Mature leaves are the primary sugar sources. A sugar sink is an organ that is a net consumer or storer of sugar. Growing roots, shoot tips, stems, and fruit are sugar sinks supplied by phloem. A storage organ, such as a tuber or a bulb, may be either a source or a sink, depending on the season. When the storage organ is stockpiling carbohydrates during the summer, it is a sugar sink. After breaking dormancy in the early spring, however, the storage organ becomes a source as its starch is broken down to sugar, which is carried away in the phloem to the growing buds of the shoot system.

Other solutes may be transported to sinks along with sugar. For example, minerals that reach leaves in xylem may later be transferred in the phloem to developing fruit.

A sugar sink usually receives its sugar from the sources nearest to it. The upper leaves on a branch may send sugar to the growing shoot tip, whereas the lower leaves on the same branch export sugar to roots. A growing fruit requires so much food that it may monopolize the sugar sources all around it. One sieve tube in a vascular bundle may carry phloem sap in one direction while sap in a different tube in the same bundle flows in the opposite direction. For each sieve tube, the direction of transport depends only on the locations of the source and sink connected by that tube. This direction may change with the season or developmental stage of the plant.

Phloem Loading and Unloading

Sugar from the mesophyll cells of a leaf and other sources must be loaded into sieve-tube members before it can be exported to sugar sinks. In some species, sucrose moves all the way from mesophyll cells to sieve-tube members via the symplast, passing from cell to cell through plasmodesmata. In other species, sucrose reaches sieve-tube members by a combination of symplastic and apoplastic pathways (FIGURE 36.16a). For example, in corn leaves, sucrose diffuses through the symplast from mesophyll cells into small veins. Much of the sugar then moves out of the cells into the apoplast (walls) in the vicinity of sieve-tube members and companion cells. This sucrose is accumulated from the apoplast (walls) directly by the sieve-tube members or by their companion cells. Companion cells pass the sugar they accumulate into the sieve-tube members through plasmodesmata linking the cells. In some plants, companion cells have numerous ingrowths of their walls, an adaptation that increases the cells' surface area and enhances the transfer of solutes between apoplast and symplast. Such modified cells are called transfer cells (see FIGURE 29.5).

Fig 36-16. Loading of sucrose into phloem.

In corn and many other plants, sieve-tube members accumulate sucrose to concentrations two to three times higher than concentrations in mesophyll, and thus phloem loading requires active transport. Proton pumps do the work that enables the cells to accumulate sucrose (FIGURE 36.16b).

Downstream, at the sink end of a sieve tube, phloem unloads its sucrose. Phloem unloading is a highly variable process; its mechanism depends on the plant species and the type of organ. Regardless of its exact mechanism, the concentration of free sugar in the sink is lower than that in the sieve tube because the unloaded sugar is either consumed during growth and metabolism of the sink cells or is converted into insoluble polymers such as starch. As a result of this sugar concentration gradient, sugar molecules diffuse from the phloem into the sink tissues, and water follows by osmosis.





 Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms

Phloem sap flows from source to sink at rates as great as 1 m/hr, which is much too fast to be accounted for by either diffusion or cytoplasmic streaming. Phloem sap moves by bulk flow, which is driven by pressure (thus the synonym pressure flow). Phloem loading results in a high solute concentration at the source end of a sieve tube, which lowers the water potential and causes water to flow into the tube (FIGURE 36.17, p. 764). Hydrostatic pressure develops within the sieve tube, and the pressure is greatest at the source end of the tube. At the sink end, the pressure is relieved by the loss of water, owing to water potential being lowered outside the sieve tube by the exodus of sucrose. The building of pressure at one end of the tube (source) and reduction of that pressure at the opposite end (sink) cause water to flow from source to sink, carrying the sugar along. Water is recycled back from sink to source by xylem vessels.

The pressure flow model explains why phloem sap always flows from a sugar source to a sugar sink, regardless of their locations in the plant. Researchers have devised several kinds of experiments to test the model. FIGURE 36.18 illustrates an innovative experiment that takes advantage of natural phloem probes: aphids that feed on phloem sap. The case for pressure flow as the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms is convincing. It is not yet known, however, if this model applies to other vascular plants.

Fig 36-18. Tapping phloem sap with the help of an aphid. (a) The "honey-dew" droplet exuded from the anus of this aphid consists of phloem sap minus some nutrients absorbed by the insect. (b) The aphid inserts a modified mouthpart called a stylet into the plant and probes until the tip of this hypodermic-like organ penetrates a single sieve-tube member (LM). The pressure within the sieve tube force-feeds the aphid, swelling it to several times its original size. (c) While the aphid is feeding, it can be anesthetized and severed from its stylet, which then serves the researcher as a miniature tap that exudes phloem sap for hours. The closer the stylet is to a sugar source, the faster the sap will flow out and the greater its sugar concentration. These results are predicted by the pressure flow hypothesis.

In our study of how sugar moves in plants, we have seen examples of plant transport on three levels: at the cellular level of transport across plasma membranes (sucrose accumulation by active transport in phloem cells); at the short-distance level of lateral transport within organs (sucrose migration from mesophyll to phloem via the symplast and apoplast); and at the long-distance level of transport between organs (bulk flow within sieve tubes). An increased understanding of these transport processes will be central to agricultural advancement in the future. Consider the fact that it is not photosynthesis that limits yield in a plant growing under ideal conditions, but the ability of the plant to transport sugar away from the leaf. Thus, the genetic engineering of higher-yielding crop plants may depend on gaining a better understanding of the factors that limit the bulk flow of sugars through the phloem.

Plant physiologists still have much to learn about the mechanisms of transport in the vascular systems of xylem and phloem. William Harvey, the great 17th-century physiologist, speculated that plants and animals have similar circulatory systems. The idea was abandoned after careful dissection failed to turn up a heart in plants. We are only now beginning to understand how a plant keeps sap flowing through its veins without the help of moving parts.
