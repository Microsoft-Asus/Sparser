MEMBRANE STRUCTURE

 

 Membrane models have evolved to fit new data



 

 Membranes are fluid



 

 Membranes are mosaics of structure and function



 

 Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition



Lipids and proteins are the staple ingredients of membranes, although carbohydrates are also important. The most abundant lipids in most membranes are phospholipids. Their ability to form membranes is built into their molecular structure. A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see FIGURE 5.12). Other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic. Furthermore, most of the proteins of membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.

How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes of cells? You encountered the currently accepted model for the arrangement of these molecules in Chapter 7 (see FIGURE 7.6). In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a fluid structure with various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. We'll discuss this model in detail, starting with the story of how it was developed.
