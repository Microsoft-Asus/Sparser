Capillaries lack the two outer layers, and their very thin walls consist only of endothelium and its basement membrane. This facilitates the exchange of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells. Arteries have thicker middle and outer layers than veins. Blood flows through the vessels of the circulatory system at uneven speeds and pressures. The thicker walls of arteries provide strength to accommodate blood pumped rapidly and at high pressure by the heart, and their elasticity helps maintain blood pressure even when the heart relaxes between contractions. The thinner-walled veins convey blood back to the heart at low velocity and pressure. Blood flows through the veins mainly as a result of muscle action; whenever we move, our skeletal muscles pinch our veins and squeeze blood through them. Within large veins, flaps of tissue act as one-way valves that allow blood to flow only toward the heart (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.9</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-9','../fig/big/fig42-9.jpg','fig42-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-9.jpg" alt="fig42-9" name="myfig42-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Blood flow in veins.</span> Contracting skeletal muscles squeeze the veins.
