MANILA , May 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Manila has obviously been trying to resolve the two hostage crisises in Mindanao in its own way from the very beginning .
In Basilan , government troops are continuing their military operations to rescue at least eight hostages who are still in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf group , a Muslim extremist group in Mindanao .
A report by the Daily Tribune said that the rebel group sent feelers Monday to Basilan Governor Wahab Akbar , expressing its desire to negotiate the release of the eight mostly school children hostages it still holds .
But Akbar reportedly said that the group is no longer in a position to negotiate since it is now about to be captured by the government army .
If the story could be confirmed , Manila 's strategy to rescue the hostages by force would prove successful , though at a high price , analysts said .
Last Wednesday , government forces rescued 15 hostages in an encounter with Abu Sayyaf rebels , but found that four hostages , including a priest , were killed , and many of the 15 hostages were wounded .
Three days later , another two headless hostages were recovered near an Abu Sayyaf camp .
But in Sulu , negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf for the release of 21 hostages has yet to start , as the hostage crisis has entered its 16th day Tuesday .
President Joseph Estrada , who rejected ransom for the release , appealed to the rebels Monday to let humanitarian organizations help ease the sufferings of the captives , mostly foreign tourists .
`` I am asking them to allow volunteer medical groups to enter the area of conflict in Mindanao and deliver water , food and medical assistance to the innocent civilians now in their captivity , '' he said in a statement .
Despite the plea , Estrada has not responded positively to requests by some of his countrymen to withdraw government troops surrounding the rebels ' hideout in Talipao , Jolo Island in Sulu .
Some people expressed their fear that putting a cordon round the rebels ' hideout might endanger the lives of the hostages .
However , government troops did not withdraw .
On the contrary , they prepared to send 3,000 members of the Moro National Liberation Front -LRB- MNLF a former rebel group which signed peace agreement with the government in 1996 , to reinforce a cordon around the Abu Sayyaf group .
The MNLF fighters , part of a regional militia , will join a 2 , 000-strong military force already surrounding the Abu Sayyaf members who are holding the 21 hostages .
The 21 hostages , one Filipino , one Lebanese , three German , two South Africans , two Finns , two French and 10 Malaysians , were abducted by the rebels from a Malaysian diving resort off Borneo on April 23 and were taken by boat to the Philippines ' Jolo Island .
Until now , no one knows what next step Manila will take to solve the crisis in Sulu , although it promised to exhaust all its peace efforts to ensure the safety of the hostages .
Meanwhile , analysts said , Manila seems not happy with any foreign interference in the hostage crisis .
Firstly , the government rejected the rebel group 's demand for involving ambassadors from all the captives ' nations in negotiations , saying only government negotiators will talk with the rebels .
Secondly , Manila does not want the hostage crisis to become an international issue , saying that the kidnapping is a domestic issue .
Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said Sunday that the planned visit of Javier Solana , European Union 's top security adviser , to the Philippines Tuesday , may encourage the Abu Sayyaf extremists .
`` The more we give a lot of publicity to this particular problem , the more these people might exploit the situation to get publicity in the media , '' he said .
Analysts said that Solana 's presence underscores the great concern of the international community over the hostage crisis and Manila may feel the pressure .
But they are not aware what Manila will do next in resolving the Sulu hostage crisis .
