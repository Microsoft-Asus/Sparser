TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Robert Cassidy met with Taiwanese economics officials Wednesday during a rare visit here by a U.S. official .
Cassidy held consultations with Economics Minister Wang Chih -kang in the afternoon , the ministry said .
A spokesman declined to comment on what they discussed .
Taiwan 's application to join the World Trade Organization , intellectual property rights protection , and the Asia Pacific region 's economic crisis topped Cassidy 's agenda , said Susan Stahl , spokeswoman for the American Institute in Taiwan which handles relations in the absence of diplomatic ties .
She called Cassidy 's visit a `` regular consultation . '
Cassidy inked an agreement with Wang in August endorsing Taiwan 's entry into the WTO , which has been a primary goal for the diplomatically isolated island .
Taiwan 's application is now being handed over to the organization 's secretariat for vetting , but it faces a potential hurdle due to opposition from China , which objects to the island joining before it does .
As is routine with U.S. officials visiting Taiwan , Cassidy is keeping a low profile during his trip to avoid riling China , with whom Washington maintains diplomatic relations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan , and strongly opposes exchanges with the island by upper level officials from countries with whom it has diplomatic ties .</ENAMEX>
