OUAGADOUGOU , June 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The council of ministers of the Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- has appealed once again to the United Nations Security Council to immediately lift the `` unjust sanctions '' it had imposed on Libya</ENAMEX> .
The OAU council of ministers , which is about to end a four-day meeting here Sunday night , called on the Security Council to do so `` pending the delivery of a verdict by the International Court of Justice -LRB- ICJ -RRB- on the dispute '' between Libya on the one side and Britain and the United States on the other .
The Security Council began to impose sanctions on Libya in 1992 after the bombing of Pan AM flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in December 1988 .
Britain and the U.S. , who have been insisting on the trial of the two accused Libyans involved in the bombing to be held in the ICJ , disputed with Libya , which said the trial should be conducted in a third country other than the world court in Hague , the Netherlands .
The obdurate stand of the two countries and the sanctions have met strong opposition from Third World countries .
Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence Shimba , in an interview with Xinhua , said the sanctions have only brought sufferings to the people of Libya .
Therefore , the sanctions should be lifted as early as possible by the Security Council , he added .
The OAU council of ministers meeting also hailed the holding of the Security Council session in March this year that focused international attention on the dispute .
The meeting , in a resolution , commended the flexibility and keenness shown by Libya in its position and its consistent commitment for an equitable solution to the dispute .
