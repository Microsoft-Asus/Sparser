Chapter 41: ANIMAL NUTRITION

NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

   Animals are heterotrophs that require food for fuel, carbon skeletons, and essential nutrients: an overview

   Homeostatic mechanisms manage an animal's fuel

   An animal's diet must supply essential nutrients and carbon skeletons for biosynthesis



FOOD TYPES AND FEEDING MECHANISMS

   Most animals are opportunistic feeders

   Diverse feeding adaptations have evolved among animals



OVERVIEW OF FOOD PROCESSING

   The four main stages of food processing are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination

   Digestion occurs in specialized compartments



THE MAMMALIAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

   The oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus initiate food processing

   The stomach stores food and performs preliminary digestion

   The small intestine is the major organ of digestion and absorption

   Hormones help regulate digestion

   Reclaiming water is a major function of the large intestine



EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS OF VERTEBRATE DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS

   Structural adaptations of digestive systems are often associated with diet

   Symbiotic microorganisms help nourish many vertebrates

Every mealtime is a reminder that we are heterotrophs dependent on a regular supply of food derived from other or ganisms. As a group, animals exhibit a great variety of nutritional adaptations. The snowshoe hare shown in the photograph on this page is adapted for life in northern forests. Able to obtain all their nutritional needs from plants alone, hares and rabbits have a large intestinal pouch housing prokaryotes and protists that digest cellulose. When deep snow covers the ground, a hare can live on pine, fir, or spruce branches--often the only plant materials available.

For any animal, a nutritionally adequate diet is essential for homeostasis, a steady-state balance in body function. A balanced diet provides fuel for cellular work, as well as all the materials the body needs to construct its own organic molecules. In this chapter we will examine the nutritional requirements of animals and look at some of the diverse adaptations for obtaining and processing food.
