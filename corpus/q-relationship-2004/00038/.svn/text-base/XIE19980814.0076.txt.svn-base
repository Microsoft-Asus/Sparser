SEOUL , August 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea has rejected a demand by the United States to lower its tariff of eight percent on imported cars .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">South Korea will not negotiate the tariff rate on auto imports , said Chung Eui -yong , deputy minister of state for trade on Friday .
`` We will continue to persuade the Americans to drop their demands for a change in our tax systems for automobiles , '' he said in response to questions on the Seoul - Washington talks about greater liberalization for South Korea 's automobile market .</ENAMEX>
The two sides failed to reach an agreement on auto trade disputes during their three-day Washington talks which closed Thursday .
Washington demanded a cut in the eight percent duty system of South Korea on imported cars , and the demand was rejected by Seoul with an argument that its rate is lower than the European Union 's 10 percent .
Washington , which earlier asked Seoul to cut its duty rate to 2.5 percent , required a cut to four percent .
The two sides differed on the automobile tax system .
Washington insisted on reducing the taxes imposed on cars while Seoul said it would take time to streamline the system .
`` The government cannot streamline the tax system immediately because it cannot afford to reduce its revenue , especially at a time when the economy is ailing , '' Chung said .
However , the two nations came close to an agreement that South Korea will allow automakers to inspect automobiles and recall them voluntarily in cases where defects are found .
At present , Seoul rules that all automakers obtain type approval from the government and have their vehicles inspected by a government agency before being allowed to sell them .
South Korea also agreed to allow financing companies to take autos purchase on installment as security .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Because of the disputes over the trade , the U.S. designated South Korea 's auto market last year as Priority Foreign Country Practice -LRB- PFCP -RRB- , under the Super 301 provision of U.S. trade law .</ENAMEX>
With the South Korean market designated PFCP , Washington is allowed under Super 301 to impose retaliatory import duties on South Korean products unless Seoul and Washington settle the disputes by October 19 .
Seoul said it will take the case to the World Trade Organization 's -LRB- WTO -RRB- dispute panel if Washington takes retaliatory measures against South Korean goods .
However , Seoul hopes that before the deadline , South Korean and the U.S. auto trade negotiators will be able to resolve the trade disputes through their talks next month .
