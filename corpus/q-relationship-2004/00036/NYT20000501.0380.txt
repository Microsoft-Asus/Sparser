SHANGHAI , China --
Measured on a per-vote basis , it was probably one of the more expensive lobbying efforts ever undertaken by the Clinton administration .
Hoping to sway legislators who remain undecided on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations in a vote set for this month , President Clinton set aside money earlier this year to fly wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and human rights conditions for themselves .
But , in the end , only two undecided congressmen showed up .
Two trips had originally been proposed , one led by Commerce Secretary William Daley and another by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman .
But these quickly became political no-flight zones for politicians worried about coming under attack by organized labor , which argues that permanent trade status would erode human rights in China and cost American jobs .
So Daley 's trip , which was to have included a dozen legislators , was `` consolidated '' with that of Glickman 's .
And when Glickman lifted off from Andrews Air Force Base last week , he had only the two undecided congressmen in tow -- and administration officials were refusing to identify them until the flight had left , lest they be pressured at the last minute to drop out of the trip .
And so began the education of Rep. Gregory Meeks , D - N.Y. , and Rep. Ruben Hinojosa , D - Texas , neither of whom had been to China before .
They were treated royally in Beijing , where they met with a deputy prime minister and watched the sun rise over the Great Wall .
In Shanghai , they had a private audience with China 's chief negotiator with Taiwan .
And in Hong Kong , they met with the chief executive of China 's newly reclaimed territory and dined with its business elite at the exclusive , 1930s-style China Club .
About a dozen administration officials accompanied them from Washington , as well as two congressmen who support making China 's trade status permanent .
And dozens more people chaperoned the men from place to place on the ground .
Meeks and Hinojosa seemed bemused by so much attention , sometimes falling behind the throng that moved through a program meant to show them how much the United States would lose if it did not grant China the permanent trade status .
China 's favorable status has been subject to annual review by Congress since the military suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , though it has always been approved .
Meeks appeared particularly suspicious of the over-orchestrated show , and skipped a supermarket visit in Shanghai in order to meet with common folk .
With a consular official translating at his side , Meeks trudged up the stairs of a middle-class apartment block and along the dirt paths of a migrant worker neighborhood in his gray summer suit and alligator shoes , addressing startled Chinese along the way with his big American hello .
`` Do you like China ? '' he asked a young migrant from Anhui province who invited him into her barren , whitewashed room .
`` Of course , I do , '' she replied , `` I 'm Chinese ! ''
Meeks questioned everyone he met about human rights -LRB- `` I 've never had any trouble , '' one elderly man replied in a typical exchange -RRB- and what they thought about China joining the World Trade Organization -LRB- `` Well , of course you should support it , we want to compete with the rest of the world , '' said Cui Qian , a middle-aged businesswoman -RRB- .
Between stops , he fought to reconcile what he had heard from the labor unions in Washington with what he saw in China .
He detected none of the repression or exploitation so often talked about .
`` The Chinese seem to think that economics are more important to them than whatever form of government they have right now , '' he concluded .
Meeks was uncertain what advantage labor unions could expect if Congress does not grant China permanent trade status when it votes on the measure later this month .
`` That 's something I 'll have to ask them , '' Meeks said , noting that the issue is muddled even in his own district , the borough of Queens .
United Parcel Service , which has a large operation at Kennedy International Airport , supports permanent trade status and China 's membership in the WTO because the company is lobbying for a cargo route to China .
The Teamsters support the UPS in that bid for the new route , which would create union jobs , but are nonetheless lobbying against permanent normal trade relations , or PNTR .
Meeks and Hinojosa watched workers in camouflage fatigues and orange hardhats unload yellow sacks of American soybeans from barges at a feed mill and cooking oil plant along Shanghai 's muddy Huangpu River .
China is the biggest buyer of American soybeans and is importing $ 700 million worth of them in the current September -to- August season .
`` There 's a lot of demand for imported soybeans in China and if we do n't give them PNTR that demand will go to the Argentinians or the Brazilians , '' bellowed Philip Laney , a bearlike man who represents the American Soybean Association in China and was on hand to lobby the congressmen .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">China has said it will apply to enter the World Trade Organization regardless of the congressional vote , and the United States is unlikely to stand in its way -- in part because such a move would infuriate Taiwan whose membership is being held up until China joins .</ENAMEX>
China 's entry does not require Congress ' support .
And although Clinton promised China during the negotiations that the annual congressional review of its trade status would end , `` China can come in regardless of what Congress votes , provided that the U.S. representatives in the General Council and the Working Party approve the conditions , along with the other member governments , '' said a Geneva -based trade official .
While no one is sure exactly what would happen if Congress votes against permanent normal trade relations , China could join and then invoke Article XIII of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO , allowing Beijing to withhold from the United States commitments it makes to other WTO members .
`` If the United States misses this opportunity it will actually lose the tremendous market of China and will be giving away the opportunity for participating in this market to its competitors , '' China 's trade minister , Shi Guangsheng , said last month .
`` In that case , the United States , especially U.S. companies , will suffer the most . ''
That has many American business people in China worried .
`` China 's government as no qualms about rewarding political cooperation with economic opportunity , '' says Jeffery Bernstein , founder of Emerge Logistics , which handles distribution of foreign products on the mainland an industry likely to open most dramatically to foreign participation if China joins the WTO. `` Jeopardizing American companies ' natural advantage in distributing products provides a wonderful opportunity for our European , Asia and Australian friends , '' he said .
`` If the American people are going to be able to take advantage of what WTO has to offer , permanent normal trade relations must be passed , '' says Larry Wortzel , director of the Heritage Foundation 's Asian Studies Center .
He says that 20 percent of the shipping containers passing through the port of Seattle are going to or coming from China , and American union workers handle all of those containers .
More than 200,000 American jobs are directly related to China trade , he adds .
The House of Representatives will vote on China 's trade status during the week of May 22 .
Legislators familiar with the vote say it is still 10 to 15 votes short of passage .
The White House has been working with Rep. Sander Levin , D - Mich. , on `` parallel legislation '' that would set up a watchdog congressional commission to review Chinese trade and human rights policies and perhaps recommend sanctions against Beijing within the limits of WTO rules .
Meeks and Hinojosa , for their part , remained undecided as they headed home this weekend .
`` You do get a different feel once you have been here , '' Meeks said .
`` Theory and practice are two different things . ''
