THE ENDOMEMBRANE SYSTEM

 

 The endoplasmic reticulum manufactures membranes and performs many other biosynthetic functions



 

 The Golgi apparatus finishes, sorts, and ships cell products



 

 Lysosomes are digestive compartments



 

 Vacuoles have diverse functions in cell maintenance



Many of the different membranes of the eukaryotic cell are part of an endomembrane system. These membranes are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane segments as tiny vesicles (sacs made of membrane). Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. Moreover, the thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, but may be modified several times during the membrane's life. The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, various kinds of vacuoles, and the plasma membrane (not actually an endomembrane in physical location, but nevertheless related to the endoplasmic reticulum and other internal membranes). We have already discussed the nuclear envelope and will now focus on the endoplasmic reticulum and the other endomembranes to which it gives rise.
