NEW YORK --
The Coast Guard abandoned the search for survivors of EgyptAir Flight 990 in waters off Nantucket Island , Mass. , on Monday , but recovered a large piece of the plane and detected submerged pinging signals , apparently from one of the black boxes , whose retrieval could explain the jetliner 's mysterious plunge into the sea .
On the second day of what was expected to be a sprawling , complex inquiry lasting months or years , investigators analyzed radar tracks of the doomed plane , questioned potential witnesses , attended to organizational tasks , set up headquarters in Rhode Island and even pursued a lead in a Los Angeles hotel where the crew had stayed .
The large questions -- whether acts of sabotage , mechanical failure or human error lay behind the disaster -- remained unanswered .
But the recovery of some wreckage and the chance that the flight-data and cockpit voice recorders might soon be found appeared to represent significant early progress .
Like many aspects of the early investigation , numerous facts begged for interpretation and elaboration -- the meaning of the radar tracks , for example , and the size and significance of the wreckage found -- but no immediate conclusions were forthcoming from officials .
`` We are dedicated to finding the cause of this tragedy , '' James Hall , the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board , said at a news briefing in Newport , R.I. `` Factual information may not be developed as quickly as the press may like , '' he said , but he added that the American and Egyptian people would be kept abreast of all the relevant facts .
In an inquiry that will undoubtedly produce many leads , an intriguing one surfaced Monday .
A law-enforcement official said the FBI was checking a report that an EgyptAir 990 crew member had complained to the management of a hotel where the crew stayed that a briefcase had been tampered with .
Agents took a bomb-sniffing dog to the room where the crew member stayed , and it reacted to a bag of sugar near a coffee maker .
The sugar and some loose wires found in the room were sent to FBI labs in Washington for analysis .
At the moment , investigators do not believe that there was ever a bomb or bomb materials in the room .
They said they were not attaching much significance to the lead .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. intelligence officials reiterated on Monday that they had no evidence of terrorism in the EgyptAir case .</ENAMEX>
A review of the plane 's cargo manifest suggested nothing out of the ordinary : it listed computer and dental equipment , aircraft spare parts for EgyptAir , and luggage .
The FBI , which was taking a clearly subordinate role to the safety board , assigned more than 600 agents to the inquiry , many from its New York , Los Angeles and Newark , N.J. , field offices .
Hundreds of additional state and local law-enforcement officials were involved , as well as others from the Defense Department , the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies .
While a review of recent intelligence data collected by national security agencies and eavesdropping techniques had unearthed nothing yet to suggest any criminal threat against the plane , one senior official noted that more than 30 Egyptian military officers had been on the flight , along with some diplomats , and that their presence might have increased the risk of terrorism .
The sheer number of investigators involved was suggestive .
`` We would n't be doing this if it was abundantly clear that it was an accident , '' the senior official said .
But he added , `` We do n't really know . ''
Many of the investigators had already interviewed baggage handlers , caterers , mechanics , ground crews , drivers of fuel trucks , customer-service workers and others who had come in contact with the plane and its occupants in recent days .
`` Everyone seems to have checked out and everyone cooperated , '' said Robert Kelly , director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York .
Much of Monday was devoted to getting organized , an effort that centered on Quonset Point , R.I. A morgue was set up for the remains of the victims , and a hangar was selected to house the wreckage of the plane , which may be pieced together in months ahead .
And accommodation was being arranged in a motel for families of the victims , some of whom were flown in from New York on Monday .
Other relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo , Egypt , in flights on Tuesday and Thursday , officials said .
As the investigation developed , the Coast Guard shifted the focus of its search from finding victims to recovering their remains , along with their effects and the remnants of their shattered aircraft .
It was a day of wrenching emotions for the families of the 217 people who went down with the plane early Sunday , for it meant the abandonment of hope that they could still be alive .
With life expectancy in the chilly 58-degree Atlantic limited to five or six hours , officials directing search operations acknowledged Monday afternoon what had been fairly obvious for a day -- that there was no longer any hope for the victims , 199 passengers and 18 employees of EgyptAir .
`` We believe at this point it is in everyone 's interests to no longer expect that we will find survivors in this case , '' Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said at a news conference in Newport 35 hours after the aircraft went down .
`` Our thoughts and prayers are with these victims and their families .
It is now a search-and-recovery operation . ''
Larrabee noted that only one body had been recovered on Sunday and that by Monday only the partial remains of other victims had been found in what he termed a saturation sea-and-air search of a 36-square-mile area around what is believed to be the aircraft 's splashdown point , about 52 miles south of Nantucket .
EgyptAir 990 , a twin-engine Boeing 767 that had come in from Los Angeles , took off from Kennedy International Airport at 1 : 19 a.m .
Sunday for what was to be an 11-hour nonstop flight to Cairo .
It was cruising at 33,000 feet in a clear night sky 31 minutes later when , without warning or signal of distress from the cockpit , it went into a two-minute plunge and crashed into the sea .
The ensuing search , involving a half-dozen Coast Guard cutters and a dozen planes and helicopters , found an abundance of debris from the plane , Larrabee said .
He cited seats , seat cushions , a wheel , clothing , personal papers , two partly inflated life rafts and two emergency chutes .
None showed evidence of scorching , suggesting that there had been no fiery explosion .
He said the searchers on Monday had also recovered `` a significant piece of the aircraft floating on the surface . ''
He did not specify its size , but called it `` a large piece of the aircraft structure , '' so large that it had to be hoisted by a crane onto the deck of the Coast Guard cutter Juniper .
Neither Larrabee nor Hall would characterize the significance of the object .
But it seemed to confirm that the aircraft had come apart , either in the air or upon impact with the ocean .
The admiral also announced that searchers had detected a pinger signal , apparently from the plane 's flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder .
The vessels currently involved in the search were not equipped to pinpoint the signal 's location , presumably on the ocean floor , but Navy ships arriving overnight would have such equipment , he said , raising hope that one of the black boxes might be recovered in the next few days .
The flight data recorder is a 24-hour machine capable of holding all the airplane 's technical data , from speed and direction to orientation , rate of fuel consumption and the exact positions of all rudders , ailerons and other moving parts .
The cockpit voice recorder , fed by three microphones , has a 30-minute tape , and could reveal what was said by the pilots throughout most of the flight , especially in the crucial last two minutes .
While the crash of EgyptAir 990 was in some ways reminiscent of that of Trans World Airlines 800 in July 1996 -- both fell into the Atlantic shortly after leaving Kennedy Airport -- there were also major differences .
TWA 800 blew up in midair , while there is as yet no evidence of any explosion aboard the Egyptian plane .
And , officials said Monday , the recovery operations for EgyptAir 990 are going to be substantially different .
The plane 's watery grave off Nantucket is 250 to 270 feet deep , twice the depth of the water off the south Shore of Long Island , where TWA 800 went down .
Moreover the water off Nantucket is much colder now than the summertime waters where the TWA wreckage was raised .
And the TWA recovery site was close to shore , while the EgyptAir site is over 50 miles offshore , compounding the difficulties of diving , recovering parts of the plane and transporting them to shore .
Another problem is the advancing season of autumn .
Larrabee noted Monday that rain and high winds were expected to buffet the search area Tuesday and Wednesday .
In any event , the Navy 's Norfolk -based ship USS Grapple was expected to arrive Tuesday with a remotely operated submersile vehicle that would be used to locate debris underwater .
In addition , the navy ship USS Mohawk , from Philadelphia , was expected .
It has sonar equipment that would enable the Navy to create a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor and objects resting on it .
The wreckage of the Egyptian aircraft is believed to be resting on the bottom near the site of several shipwrecks including the luxury liner Andrea Doria , which sank in July 1956 , after colliding with the Swedish ship Stockholm .
The sea floor in the area is believed to be relatively smooth , so objects would be more readily apparent .
Eighty relatives and friends of the crash victims arrived in Newport on a chartered flight from New York on Monday afternoon and were met by two buses that took them to the Newport Islander Doubletree Hotel , a secluded place on a small island off Newport .
They did not speak to reporters .
But George Arian , the publisher of a small Arabic newspaper in New Jersey who said he was acting as an unofficial spokesman for the group , said , `` Everyone was weeping and crying on the plane , and the Red Cross people talked to them . ''
He said about 100 relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo and would also be put up at the hotel .
