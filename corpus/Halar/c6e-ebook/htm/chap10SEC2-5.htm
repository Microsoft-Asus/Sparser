The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon, one of the molecule’s electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. After absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, the pigment molecule is said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of atom or molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Photons are absorbed by clusters of pigment molecules embedded in the thylakoid membrane (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.9</span>). The energy of an absorbed photon is converted to the potential energy of an electron raised from the ground state to an excited state. But the electron cannot remain there long; the excited state, like all high-energy states, is unstable. Generally, when pigments absorb light, their excited electrons drop back down to the ground-state orbital in a billionth of a second, releasing their excess energy as heat. This conversion of light energy to heat is what makes the top of an automobile so hot on a sunny day. (White cars are coolest because their paint reflects all wavelengths of visible light, although it may absorb ultraviolet and other invisible radiation.) Some pigments, including chlorophyll, emit light as well as heat after absorbing photons. The electron jumps to a state of greater energy, and as it falls back to ground state, a photon is given off. This afterglow is called fluorescence. If a solution of chlorophyll isolated from chloroplasts is illuminated, it will fluoresce in the red part of the spectrum and also give off heat (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.10</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig10-10','../fig/big/fig10-10.jpg','fig10-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig10-10.jpg" alt="fig10-10" name="myfig10-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 10-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Excitation of isolated chlorophyll by light.

This redox reaction occurs when light excites the electron to a higher energy level in chlorophyll and the electron acceptor traps the high-energy electron before it can return to the ground state in the chlorophyll molecule. Isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor to prevent electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll from dropping right back to the ground state. In a chloroplast, the acceptor molecule functions like a dam that prevents this immediate plunge of high-energy electrons back to the ground state. Thus, each photosystem--reaction-center chlorophyll and primary electron acceptor surrounded by an antenna complex--functions in the chloroplast as a light-harvesting unit. The solar-powered transfer of electrons from chlorophyll to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">The thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis.

The reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I is known as P700 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 700 nm (the far-red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll at the reaction center of photosystem II is called P680 because its absorption spectrum has a peak at 680 nm (also in the red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P700 and P680, are actually identical chlorophyll <span class="Emphasis1">a</span> molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane affects the electron distribution in the chlorophyll molecules and accounts for the slight differences in light-absorbing properties.

An electron transport chain assembled in a membrane pumps protons across the membrane as electrons are passed through a series of carriers that are progressively more electronegative. In this way, electron transport chains transform redox energy to a proton-motive force, potential energy stored in the form of an H<SUP>+</SUP> gradient across a membrane. Built into the same membrane is an ATP synthase complex that couples the diffusion of hydrogen ions down their gradient to the phosphorylation of ADP. Some of the electron carriers, including the iron-containing proteins called cytochromes, are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The ATP synthase complexes of the two organelles are also very much alike. But there are noteworthy differences between oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and photophosphorylation in chloroplasts. In mitochondria, the high-energy electrons dropped down the transport chain are extracted from food molecules (which are thus oxidized). Chloroplasts do not need food to make ATP; their photosystems capture light energy and use it to drive electrons to the top of the transport chain. In other words, mitochondria transfer chemical energy from food molecules to ATP, whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy.</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText">The spatial organization of chemiosmosis also differs in chloroplasts and mitochondria (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.15</span>).

The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space, which functions as the H<SUP>+</SUP> reservoir. The thylakoid membrane makes ATP as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through ATP synthase complexes, whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane.

		 a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by NADP<SUP>+</SUP>. The diffusion of H<SUP>+</SUP> from the thylakoid space to the stroma (along the H<SUP>+</SUP> concentration gradient) powers the ATP synthase. These light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the sugar-producing Calvin cycle.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s summarize the light reactions. Noncyclic electron flow pushes electrons from water, where they are at a low state of potential energy, to NADPH, where they are stored at a high state of potential energy. The light-driven electron current also generates ATP. Thus, the equipment of the thylakoid membrane converts light energy to the chemical energy stored in NADPH and ATP. (Oxygen is a by-product.) Let’s now see how the Calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to synthesize sugar from CO<SUB>2</SUB>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
