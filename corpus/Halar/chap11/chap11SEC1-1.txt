AN OVERVIEW OF CELL SIGNALING

 

 Cell signaling evolved early in the history of life



 

 Communicating cells may be close together or far apart



 

 The three stages of cell signaling are reception, transduction, and response



What do cells talk about? What kinds of things does a "talking" cell say to a "listening" cell, and how does the latter cell respond to the message? Let's approach these questions by first looking at communication among microorganisms, for modern microbes are a window to the role of cell signaling in the evolution of life on Earth.
