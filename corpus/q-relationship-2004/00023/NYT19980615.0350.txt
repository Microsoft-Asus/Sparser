ROME --
Warning that the eyes of past and future victims `` are fixed upon us , '' the U.N. secretary-general Monday urged establishment of a global war crimes court as a `` bulwark against evil . ''
The secretary-general , Kofi Annan , opened a five-week conference here to develop rules for a permanent tribunal that could prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity .
He urged the delegates , from 156 nations , to take a firm stand : `` I trust you will not flinch from creating a court strong and independent enough to carry out its task .
It must be an instrument of justice , not expediency . ''
But just how strong and independent such a court will be is one of the critical issues to be decided .
The United States wants to limit the court 's jurisdiction .
Washington is concerned that unless the Security Council has a say in what crimes are brought to trial , American soldiers around the globe could be prosecuted on politically motivated charges .
But such traditional American allies as Britain and Canada say the court should work as independently as possible and are leading a coalition of 40 to 50 nations , the `` like-minded group , '' that want to minimize Security Council involvement .
Before hunkering down in private to debate more than 400 disputed articles in the draft , the two sides moved quickly Monday to stake claims in the battle for public opinion .
There is broad consensus that the court should be called in only when national courts are unable or unwilling to act , and only for the gravest of crimes , like genocide and civilian massacres .
Responding to the systematic use of sexual assault in wars in the Balkans and Rwanda , the court is expected to include rape as a recognized war crime for the first time , alongside torture , prisoner abuse and violence against civilians .
Support is not quite as widespread for a provision mandating the court to prosecute crimes committed during internal conflicts , which account for 90 percent of the victims of war today .
Some states argue that the court should only investigate crimes in conflicts between nations .
These arguments are viewed as fatally obstructionist by human rights groups .
France , for example , is leading an effort to require the court to obtain a nation 's consent before investigating crimes committed by its leaders or soldiers .
Rights groups have denounced that proposal as tantamount to destroying the court 's credibility .
Canada , which holds the chairmanship of the conference , has warned that members of the `` like-minded group '' might walk away from a treaty rather than allow it to be watered down .
`` We want to make it very clear to those who are trying to compromise down to the lowest common denominator that they have no chance , '' warned the Canadian foreign minister , Lloyd Axworthy .
Having no court `` is better than a Potemkin village . ''
Both Axworthy and Annan cited the treaty to ban the use of land mines as a promising precedent to build popular support for the court .
Last year more than 120 nations signed a treaty to ban the production and use of anti-personnel land mines in a conference in Ottawa that was organized outside U.N. channels .
The United States , Russia and China did not sign the treaty .
Hinting at the way the United States was isolated on the land-mine issue , Annan told reporters , `` No one country , I hope , will want to be responsible for the failure of this conference . ''
Axworthy said that in terms of public relations , the court would be a harder sell than the ban on land mines .
`` On land mines , we had Princess Diana looking at broken children in Angola , '' he explained .
`` The court is more abstract ; people do n't get as excited by legal issues , especially where lawyers are concerned . ''
