MANILA , March 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Philippines is weighing reports of cattle afflicted with `` mad cow disease '' before it decides to ban beef exports from Britain .
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today , `` It 's a very technical issue that must be studied carefully before any action , such as banning imports of British beef , could be taken . ''
Meanwhile , British embassy spokesman Matthew Gould noted that Britain had taken `` several protective measures '' since 1989 to prevent the spread of the disease .
`` There are no possible grounds to doubt the safety of British beef , '' he said , citing the lack of scientific evidence that the disease spreads from one species to another .
Recent cases of a fatal disease , believed to be caused by eating meat infected with mad cow disease , have sparked alarms in capitals around the world .
The reports have led 10 members of the European Union and an increasing number of other countries to impose precautionary bans on British beef .
