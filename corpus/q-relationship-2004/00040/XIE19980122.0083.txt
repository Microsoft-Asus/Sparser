CANBERRA , January 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Japanese fishing vessels will be banned from fishing for endangered southern bluefin tuna in Australian waters after three days of talks on fishing quotas collapsed , the Australian government said Thursday .
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said in a statement that Japan had refused to accept quotas set at a responsible level in the talks between Australia , Japan and New Zealand , the three members of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna .
Japan had also announced it could introduce an experimental fishing program , which would push its catch above last year 's limit , Parer said .
`` Japan 's position is completely unacceptable to Australia .
Accordingly , we will not allow Japanese fishing vessels to operate in our exclusive economic zone until the commission has set responsible quotas . ''
A 16-hour marathon meeting by CCSBT representatives ended here Thursday without setting a quota for fishing in 1998 .
However , Parer said he still hoped the disagreement could be resolved .
Last year , the total allowable catch of southern bluefin tuna was 11,750 tons , with 5,265 tons allocated to Australia , 6,065 tons to Japan and 420 tons to New Zealand .
In the just-concluded meeting , Japan asked to increase the total allowable catch by 3,000 tons a year from the current 11,750 tons while Australia wanted to maintain the status quo and New Zealand called for reducing the catch by 3,000 tons .
The southern bluefin tuna was declared an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 1996 .
