AMMAN , Jordan --
She stood up for her country when the United States accused it of being too soft on Iraq , but back home she has been seen as being just too American .
Now that Jordan 's Queen Noor , 47 , is literally by the sick bed of her husband , Jordan 's King Hussein , the woman who has worked hard to straddle two cultures faces an uncertain future .
Last week , the ailing Hussein , 63 , shocked his country and the region by removing his brother Hassan from the role of heir , which he held for 33 years , and replacing him with Hussein 's first son , Abdullah .
The change was notable for its transparent intrigue .
Hussein wrote , in a letter to Hassan , that `` parasites '' and `` climbers '' were poisoning the palace atmosphere .
Queen Noor was in the mix .
Friends and observers , though most speaking anonymously , said she had longed hope that her son Hamzah , could be the next King .
Hamzah is Noor 's first son , but not the king 's .
Jordan 's Ambassador to the United States , Marwan Muasher , `` categorically '' denies that Noor ever got involved .
Hamzah is Hussein 's favorite son and , had he become heir , it would have sealed Noor 's status .
But the prince is only 18 years old .
Some say she will be a respected queen mother , maintaining her charitable works .
But , finding a popular role has always been a challenge for Noor among Jordanians , many of whom still look at her suspiciously as a foreigner .
Hussein seemed intent on securing a place in Jordan for his wife , apparently answering the criticisms he has heard of the conspicuous blonde with the heavy American accent in her Arabic .
`` She brought happiness and cared for me during my illness with the utmost affection , '' he wrote .
`` She , the Jordanian , who belongs to this country with every fiber of her being , holds her head high in the defense and service of this country 's interest . ''
She has been accused of spending too freely and being too much in the jet-set .
It may be that Jordanians criticize her for things they do n't want to express about the rest of the royal family .
`` She 's not the only one -LRB- in the royal family -RRB- who 's corrupt , but , certainly , her tastes are very apparent in this poor kingdom , '' said Laith Shubailat , a Jordanian dissident .
Shubailat 's niece is Noor 's press secretary .
But , when he ridiculed Noor for crying at the funeral of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- Hussein 's treaty with Israel is highly unpopular among Jordanians -- it was one of the statements the police cited in jailing him for 11 months .
Noor 's background makes her an equally easy target , and unlikely Arab figurehead .
She was born in the United States as Lisa Halaby , to a mother of Swedish background and father Najeeb Halaby , of Syrian - Lebanese descent .
Born in the United States , he once headed Pan American World Airways .
Lisa Halaby was a cheerleader and protested against the Vietnam War .
She graduated from Princeton -- class of 1974 -- with a degree in architecture .
Working on an aviation university in Jordan , she met Hussein , the avid pilot .
Their courtship included palace dinners , introductions to the children from his three previous marriages and rides on the back of the macho King 's motorcycle .
They were married in 1978 , the tall blonde with the beauty-queen looks and the short-but-regal descendent of the Islamic prophet Mohammed .
Lisa Halaby converted to Islam and became Noor Al - Hussein , meaning `` Light of Hussein . ''
Noor has said she found adjusting to Jordan easy , relying on a coterie of strong women friends that defied Arab stereotypes .
But , there was clearly a cultural gap to bridge .
`` She came here under very difficult circumstances , '' said former chief of Noor 's office , Mohammad Al - Adwan , addressing the tough time that outsiders face in the cliquish world of Amman .
She founded Jordan 's gifted school and a music conservatory .
Her Noor Al - Hussein Foundation helps Jordan 's poor , rural women find economic independence through crafts , poultry raising and beekeeping .
Since the death of Britain 's Princess Diana , she has headed the international push to ban land mines .
Risking controversy in a society steeped in tradition , she has spoken out against `` honor killings , '' in which brothers or fathers in Jordan sometimes kill female family members who have sex outside of marriage .
In 1990 , after U.S. officials vilified Hussein for staying neutral in the Gulf War , Noor traveled to Washington , D.C. to help explain her country 's position .
But , her first job is to stay in her husband 's shadow .
`` She is not supposed to be the star .
You cannot have a Princess Diana in Jordan .
No way , '' says Salameh Nematt , a Jordanian journalist .
`` It 's a man-dominated society . ''

Jordanians appreciate that Noor raised four children to speak excellent Arabic .
She often wears embroidered Jordanian Bedouin dresses and , according to a friend , will serve tea and sweets herself at gatherings .
She moved Jordanians with her attentiveness to Hussein during a bout with cancer in 1992 .
It quieted rumors that the marriage was in trouble due to infidelities by Hussein .
Mostly , people say they like her because she is Hussein 's choice .
`` She is nice .
She is popular because she is the Queen , '' said grocer Nwayer Naber , 37 .
In a barber shop , haircutters echoed that mild endorsement .
But , one leaned forward on his chair to add carefully : `` She is originally American .
Her name is not Noor .
It is something else . ''
