NICOSIA , April 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- - Russia will work to achieve the demilitarization of Cyprus and the convocation of an international conference on the Cyprus issue , Russian ambassador to Cyprus Boris Zenkov said here today .
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides , Zenkov said that during the forthcoming meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , Russia will `` insist on promoting the demilitarization of Cyprus and the convening of an international conference on the Cyprus problem . ''
According to U.N. Secretary - General 's resident representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel , the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council will meet in New York on April 17 to try to work out a concerted approach by all parties involved in an effort to revive the stalled Cyprus peace talks .
The Russian ambassador said that the idea of a demilitarized Cyprus `` heads in the right direction '' and that `` only a demilitarized Cyprus can find a just solution '' .
Asked if there is a Russian initiative to push the stalled Cyprus talks forward , Zenkov said that `` we all hope to find a way out of the present situation .
I do not think any single country can solve a complex problem on her own . ''
`` In essence , the Cyprus problem is an issue which concerns all nations , '' he added .
Referring to Russia 's arms sales to the island , Zenkov said he did not think it proper if Russia were to deny arms sales to Cyprus to strengthen its defense .
`` Since we recognize the Republic of Cyprus and we have had very good ties for years , I do not believe it would be right to reject a request to meet the legal right of the Republic of Cyprus to strengthen its defense , '' Zenkov said .
Last year , Cyprus purchased a number of Russian BMP -3 armored vehicles .
Moreover , Cyprus has shown interest to buy Russian tanks and medium range anti-aircraft missile systems during Cyprus ' Defense Minister Costas Eliades ' recent visit to Moscow .
