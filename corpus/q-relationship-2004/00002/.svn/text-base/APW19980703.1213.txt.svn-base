Japan 's Planet - B probe to Mars blasted into space Saturday , beginning the first effort by a nation other than the two former Cold War superpowers to visit another world .
The 450-kilo -LRB- half-ton -RRB- unmanned craft was launched from Kagoshima Space Center in southern Japan without problems , the state-run NHK television said .
Planet - B , renamed Nozomi or `` Hope '' after liftoff , is scheduled to begin beaming back photographs and experimental data from the Red Planet in October 1999 .
Japan is only the third nation after the United States and Russia to have attempted an interplanetary space mission .

One reason Japan chose the July 4 liftoff date was to celebrate the first anniversary of the United States ' Mars Pathfinder mission , officials said .
But unlike the Pathfinder , which broadcast dramatic images from the Martian surface , the Japanese probe will conduct experiments from orbit high above the planet .
Planet - B will swing by Earth twice to pick up enough speed to make the 700 million-kilometer -LRB- 440 million-mile -RRB- journey to Mars in 10 months .
Once there , the 11 billion yen -LRB- dlrs 80 million -RRB- probe will examine the Martian atmosphere to study how it reacts to solar winds and measure the rate at which oxygen escapes into space .
Planet - B will also photograph the planet 's massive sand storms and use high-frequency pulses to search for traces of water beneath its surface .
Japan will rely on the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's deep space tracking network to receive the probe 's transmissions .
Japan 's next planned missions include a robot probe in 2002 to bring back rock samples from one of the solar system 's thousands of asteroids .
Japan 's next visit to an alien planet will likely be a probe to Mercury launched early in the next millennium .
