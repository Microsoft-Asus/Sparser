CARBOHYDRATES--FUEL AND BUILDING MATERIAL

 

 Sugars, the smallest carbohydrates, serve as fuel and carbon sources



 

 Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles



Carbohydrates include both sugars and their polymers. The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, or single sugars, also known as simple sugars. Disaccharides are double sugars, consisting of two monosaccharides joined by condensation. The carbohydrates that are macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers of many sugars.
