NEW YORK --
Three Venezuelan leaders are on a mission in the United States this week to convince Americans that their oil-rich nation of 23 million is emerging from months of political strife and getting its act together .
The leaders , members of Venezuela 's National Constituent Assembly , which is rewriting the nation 's constitution for the 27th time in its 188-year history , acknowledged Wednesday that the process of creating a new system of government from scratch has been messy .
But `` despite the disruptions , no one has been killed or injured , '' said Isaias Rodriguez , who is the assembly 's first vice president .
`` The tensions have been resolved . ''
After a breakfast meeting here with reporters , the Venezuelans traveled to Washington to meet with State Department officials as well as representatives of the Organization of American States and the Inter - American Development Bank .
On Tuesday they met with Wall Street financiers and analysts .
They will wrap up their trip Friday by meeting with former President Jimmy Carter in Atlanta .
Carter led an international delegation that monitored Venezuela 's presidential election last December in which the current president , Hugo Chavez , was elected .
`` We are trying to transmit confidence , '' said Claudio Eloy Fermin , an assembly delegate .
`` To do that , you have to respect property and -LRB- promote -RRB- less government interference in the economy . ''
The turmoil in Venezuela pits Chavez , a former army lieutenant colonel jailed in 1992 for plotting a coup , against the leaders of the nation 's two main parties that control Venezuela 's Congress and have dominated politics there since the 1950s .
The Congress leaders oppose the 131-member assembly , which was elected in July .
Chavez , 45 , and his backers who control the assembly say the Congress and the two parties are corrupt .
The parties , they charge , have promoted nepotism and looted Venezuela 's coffers , leaving the majority of its population impoverished despite Venezuela 's considerable oil wealth .
Chavez , a follower of South America 's great 19th century liberator , Simon Bolivar , has styled himself a populist crusading against waste and inefficiency in government , including the judiciary .
As president , he has cut the number of ministries from 29 to 13 and eliminated 500 governmental bodyguard positions .
But leaders of the two main parties , Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party , have accused Chavez and his followers of a crude power grab .
The party leaders say the assembly is a tool of Chavez designed to do an end run around Congress .
The crisis reached a climax late last month when the assembly voted essentially to shut down the Congress .
Chavez 's opponents compared him with Cuba 's communist dictator Fidel Castro .
The United States , a major purchaser of Venezuelan oil , took a dim view of the assembly 's action .
But last week the assembly relented .
It and the Congress agreed to a power-sharing scheme until Venezuela 's new constitution is completed by the end of October .
A referendum approving or disapproving it could take place by the end of the year .
Venezuelan leaders are now trying to soothe feelings in U.S. financial and political circles .
Chavez is planning a visit to the United Nations and to Washington later this month .
Ricardo Combellas , another assembly delegate , said Wednesday that `` we have had a system that has operated totally behind closed doors in the past , but it 's not closed now .
We are the ones who are legitimizing Congress . ''
The three delegates characterized the recent political turmoil as a natural byproduct of a new political system replacing the old .
`` The United States has constitutional stability and Venezuela does not , '' said Rodriguez .
`` We want our constitution to have permanency . ''
Fermin said that formulating a new governmental system through a constitution is `` a democratic act , and it will be carried out democratically . ''
Fermin , a 1993 presidential candidate of the Democratic Action Party , said he had opposed the assembly and advocated reforming Venezuela 's constitution through the Congress .
But he decided to run for the assembly anyway this summer .
`` I have to be the guardian of my ideas , '' he said .
`` I cannot be outside . ''
Although not a Chavez supporter , Fermin said , `` It bothers me very strongly that -LRB- the political parties opposing Chavez -RRB- are telling the country and the world that we are in a dictatorship .
That 's not true . ''
