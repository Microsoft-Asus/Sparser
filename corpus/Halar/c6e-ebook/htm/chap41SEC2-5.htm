Many aquatic animals are <span class="Emphasis2">suspension-feeders</span> that sift small food particles from the water. Clams and oysters, for example, use their gills to trap tiny morsels, which are then swept along with a film of mucus to the mouth by beating cilia. Baleen whales, the largest animals ever to live, are also suspension-feeders. They swim with their mouths agape, straining millions of small animals from huge volumes of water forced through screenlike plates attached to their jaws (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.6</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig41-6','../fig/big/fig41-6.jpg','fig41-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig41-6.jpg" alt="fig41-6" name="myfig41-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 41-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Suspension-feeding: a baleen whale.</span> The humpback whale and other baleen whales use comblike plates suspended from the upper jaw to sift small invertebrates from enormous volumes of water. The whale opens its mouth and fills an expandable oral pouch with water, then closes its mouth and contracts the pouch. This forces water out of the mouth through the baleen, leaving a mouthful of trapped food.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Substrate-feeders</span> live in or on their food source, eating their way through the food.
