BEIJING --
A Chinese news service reported Wednesday that the navy was conducting mobilization exercises along the southern coast , across from Taiwan .
But it appears to be a relatively moderate operation that hints at little real military preparation .
On Tuesday , a newspaper ran a front-page photograph of military helicopters intended to look as though they were preparing for battle .
But the picture was so badly doctored , so obviously fake , that it had the opposite effect of signaling Beijing 's distinctly halfhearted attitude toward potential conflict with Taiwan .
Nearly three weeks after President Lee Teng -hui caused an uproar by asserting that Taiwan would deal with China only on a `` special state-to-state '' basis , heightening tension about a possible military conflict , Chinese officials and Western diplomats say Beijing is shying away from any action .
Despite Beijing 's insistence that it would use military force to block a declaration of independence by Taiwan , which it has considered a renegade province since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 , the danger of military conflict , it seems clear , is receding .
Editorials in the Communist Party newspaper People 's Daily continue to denounce Lee , but behind the often vociferous warnings , the overall reaction in Beijing has been restrained .
`` China has to express its position strongly , '' a senior Chinese official involved in talks with Taiwan said .
`` But there does n't seem to be any need for military action this time . ''
One reason behind China 's relatively reserved response , the official said , is that Lee is scheduled to be replaced in elections in March .
Because Beijing sees the Taiwan -born Lee as predisposed against China , it makes sense to wait until his successor takes office .
That is especially the case , because the candidate who is leading in Taiwan opinion polls , James Soong , favors more cordial ties with China .
`` Seven months is not such a long time , '' the official said .
`` We can wait . ''
A second reason is that Beijing recognizes that in the last Taiwan crisis , in 1996 , China 's decision to launch missiles near Taiwan only created sympathy for Lee , achieving the opposite of what Beijing intended .
China 's military may have also been humiliated when the United States sent two carrier battle groups to the region to show support for Taiwan .
`` They learned a lesson in ` 96 , '' a Western diplomat in Beijing said as he referred to China 's leaders .
`` This time , if they sit back and do nothing , it 's Lee who 's getting all the flak . ''
It is indeed Lee who has drawn international criticism for roiling diplomatic waters .
When President Clinton spoke out last week in support for Beijing 's position that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan should continue to be considered a single country , that effectively drew Washington closer to Beijing and further from Taipei .
`` Lee Teng -hui is actually bringing China and the U.S. closer together , '' said the Chinese official , who favors close ties with the United States .
`` We should thank him . ''
In Taiwan on Wednesday , Lee rejected the sobriquet `` troublemaker '' that Beijing has tried to pin on him , saying that Taiwan should wait until China is more democratic and economically developed before it seriously considers reunification .
Talks between China and Taiwan , conducted in off-again-on-again since they began in 1993 , appear to be off again .
Wang Daohan , a senior Chinese official scheduled to visit Taiwan in October , is virtually certain to cancel that trip .
Officially , Wang is waiting for his Taiwan counterpart , Koo Chen -fu , to take a public stance on Taiwan - China relations before a decision is made about continuing talks .
But Beijing said over the weekend that with the vanishing premise of the talks -- that both sides agree on a `` one China '' formula -- it is highly unlikely that they will go forward .
From Beijing 's view , the danger of taking no real action in response to Lee 's move is that politicians in Taiwan may conclude that they can take steps to distance themselves further from China without any negative response from Beijing .
In an effort to deliver a tough-sounding , but ultimately ambiguous , message , Beijing appears to have authorized news reports in China -backed news media in Hong Kong that report on military preparations off the Taiwan coast .
Last week , Wen Wei Po , a Communist Party -owned newspaper in Hong Kong that rarely reports sensitive political news without instruction from Beijing , reported in unusual detail about military preparations by the Nanjing Military Region , which oversees Chinese military forces in Fujian province , across the coast from Taiwan .
The paper reported that the deputy chief of staff of the Nanjing Military Region , Su Jing , had watched military drills in which sailors sang , `` We will liberate Taiwan . ''
Yet two days later , officials in the region denied the reports .
The report Wednesday by China News Service appeared to follow the same pattern , reporting military preparations that send a guarded signal to Taiwan , but allowing Beijing room for deniability .
All along , Taiwan military intelligence has told local news media that it had detected no serious military activity on the mainland side of the 100-mile wide strait that separates Taiwan from the mainland .
As Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China reminded reporters in Singapore this week , China has never renounced the threat of using force against Taiwan , should peaceful means fail to achieve Beijing 's cherished goal of reunification .
In more tough-sounding language , the New China News Agency reported Wednesday that the chief of the People 's Liberation Army general staff had warned Lee to stop `` separatist '' activity .
`` The PLA has the determination and strength to defend the state 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , '' the official , Fu Quanyou , told a visiting Malaysian military official .
Yet behind such language , there seems to be relatively little punch .
One factor often overlooked by outsiders is that military experts say any large-scale amphibious assault on Taiwan by China would face enormous military difficulties .
Taiwan , operating American -supplied F -16 fighter planes , has distinct air superiority .
Even a more militarily feasible attack on one of the small islands controlled by Taiwan that are next to China 's southern coast , Kinmen and Matsu , could prompt retaliation by Taiwanese guided missiles that would cause serious damage to mainland cities .
A less direct military confrontation could involve the launching of Chinese missiles into the sea near Taiwan , as in 1995 and 1996 , or an attempt to blockade sea traffic around Taiwan .
There is little sign that Beijing has the political will for military action in the near future .
China 's leaders left Beijing this week for the seaside resort of Beidaihe , where they are holding an annual political gathering intended to sort out pressing issues of the day .
Although Taiwan may be on the agenda , leaders appear to be more concerned now with Falun Gong , the spiritual movement that Beijing has outlawed and has made the target of a major political campaign .
The other top issue at the gathering is said to be money-losing state-run industries , which the authorities have been trying to reorganize , without success .
