Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transfer hydrogen from various substrates to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>) as a by-product, from which the organelle derives its name. These reactions may have many different functions. Some peroxisomes use oxygen to break fatty acids down into smaller molecules that can then be transported to mitochondria as fuel for cellular respiration. Peroxisomes in the liver detoxify alcohol and other harmful compounds by transferring hydrogen from the poisons to oxygen. The H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> formed by peroxisome metabolism is itself toxic, but the organelle contains an enzyme that converts the H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> to water. Enclosing in the same space both the enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide and those that dispose of this toxic compound is another example of how the cell’s compartmental structure is crucial to its functions.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-19','../fig/big/fig7-19.jpg','fig7-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-19.jpg" alt="fig7-19" name="myfig7-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Peroxisomes.</span> Peroxisomes are roughly spherical and often have a granular or crystalline core that is probably a dense collection of enzyme molecules.
