 Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants

The mistletoe we find tacked above doorways during the holiday season lives in nature as a parasite on oaks and other trees. Mistletoe is photosynthetic, but it supplements its nutrition by using projections called haustoria to siphon xylem sap from the vascular tissue of the host tree. Some parasitic plants, such as dodder (FIGURE 37.15a), do not perform photosynthesis at all, drawing all their nutrients from other plants by tapping into the host's vascular tissue. In another version of parasitism, Indian pipe obtains its nutrients from trees indirectly via its association with fungal hyphae of the host tree's mycorrhizae (FIGURE 37.15b).

Plants called epiphytes (from the Greek epi, upon, and phyton, plant) are sometimes mistaken for parasites. An epiphyte is an autotrophic plant that nourishes itself but grows on the surface of another plant, usually on the branches or trunks of trees. An epiphyte is anchored to its living substratum, but it absorbs water and minerals mostly from rain that falls on its leaves. Examples of epiphytes are staghorn ferns, some mosses, Spanish moss (actually an angiosperm), and many species of bromeliads and orchids.
