;;;  Version:  1.5 March 2003

;; initiated 6/14/93 v2.3
;; but giving them a lot more power to make decisions
;; 0.1 (6/30) made the ] routine more modular by incorporating code from the
;;      scan routine -- lets it be called from different points
;; 0.2 (3/17/94) added case for conjunction.], moved to rules;brackets
;; 0.3 (4/24) commented out a reference to verb]., since couldn't find its
;;      definition and trying to run with a minimal grammar.
;; 0.4 (5/5) backing out of earlier decision to mark the status of a segment-ending
;;      position as :ended-segment because it seems to be losing useful information.
;; 0.5 (5/26) added ].adverb.  6/9,10 added mvb]. & verb].
;; 0.6 (7/11) adding some reasoning.  
;; 1.0 (7/13) added elaboration to extend the handling of det+noun/verb
;; 1.1 (8/4) tweeked flag in that elaboration to be a kcons to record its position
;; 1.2 (10/19) switched back to commenting out reference to verb]. that is of
;;      unclear value -- see [random and hacks].  10/24 added triv. case
;; 1.3 (11/17) added .[np case to the test that overrules vg-starts
;; 1.4 (1/23/95) added .[adverb + ].verb case
;;     (1/24) added case for ]newline.  1/25 pulled an old break.  1/30 added
;;      ].treetop.  2/15 tweeked stub msg in checking for stronger open bracket and
;;      put in a real test against bracket ranks
;; 1.5 (4/3) looked carefully at the verb]. problem and realized it was redundant
;;      with mvb].
;;     (4/20) started to deal w/  "[ has ][ awarded ..." problem
;;     (6/28/96) added case for ].text-segment
;;     (7/11) hit a trivial case in the (stubbed) equal-rank-brackets test
;;     (3/26/03) Added proper-noun to Bracket-ends-the-segment? to handle a year by
;;      itself.
