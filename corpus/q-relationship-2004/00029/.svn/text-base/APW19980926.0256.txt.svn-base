<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">FBI agents have returned to a white two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya</ENAMEX> that killed 248 people , the new tenants said Saturday .
An American couple , who refused to give their names , said FBI agents , who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug. 7 bombing , returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard and the exterior of No. 43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge of the Kenyan capital .
The couple , who explained that they were trying to complete the move into their new home in peace , refused further comment and would not say who owned the house .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil , one of four suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in the blast</ENAMEX> .
According to a complaint filed Sept. 17 by the U.S. Attorney 's office in Manhattan , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Fazil , a native of the Comoros Islands off East Africa , rented the house from May to August and was later joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud ` Owhali</ENAMEX> .
No neighbors , other residents , security guards or household employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil 's stay .
It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi investigating the bombing .
According to the complaint , the bomb that destroyed the embassy was built at the house rented by Fazil , who is a fugitive .
He is alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the bomb .
The house is about 12 kilometers -LRB- 8 miles -RRB- from the embassy building in downtown Nairobi .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Fazil , ` Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh , the other suspect charged in the Kenyan bombing , are believed to be members of the al- Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> .
The latter two are in custody in New York .
On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim , who was arrested Sept. 16 in Germany on an Iterpol warrant , was charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens .
He was not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing .
In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7 , another bomb killed 11 people , all Africans , at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held by police in Dar es Salaam .
Adadi Rajabu , head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian police , was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection with the bombing</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">One of the suspects charged , Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed , owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper , Daily Nation , to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them</ENAMEX> .
Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the mid 1980s .
Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the attack .
