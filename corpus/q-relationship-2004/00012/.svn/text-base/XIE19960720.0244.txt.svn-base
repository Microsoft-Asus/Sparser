WASHINGTON , July 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- --<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY"> Top U.S. officials investigating the explosion of the TWA plane today offered Congress members no conclusion on the cause of the crash , but another senior aviation safety official said it might be `` a criminal act . ''</ENAMEX>
James Hall , chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- , and Federal Bureau of Investigation -LRB- FBI -RRB- Director Louis Freeh briefed members of Congress and told them they did not know how long it might take to find out the cause of the crash that killed 230 people .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">However , NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis told CNN this morning `` the possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one . ''
But at the same time he urged people not to assume that it was a terrorist work .</ENAMEX>
Meanwhile , U.S. officials are trying to prevent people from threatened by terrorism at a time when the Summer Olympic Games is going on the American land .
On Thursday , President Bill Clinton , while expressing his condolences for the 230 people killed on the plane , warned Americans not to assume it was a terrorist act .
He referred to the apparently incorrect early speculation that the April 19 , 1995 , bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City might have been the work of foreign terrorists .
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt , after being briefed by Clinton , said today that the president wanted to dampen speculation .
`` We 've got the Olympics going on , '' he said , paraphrasing Clinton .
`` People have been worrying about terrorism at the Olympics .
The last thing we need to do is to frighten people wrongly about terrorism if it does n't exist . ''
Pentagon officials today discounted reports that radar had detected an object approaching the plane seconds before the explosion , an Associated Press report said .
Federal officials also were checking out claims of responsibility that were being made .
It was reported that the underground Movement for Islamic Change had sent a fax to an Arab newspaper in London a day before the explosion , threatening to hit an American target .
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said there had been `` a variety of calls '' claiming responsibility for the crash , but that their credibility was doubtful .
Investigators put hopes on the search of the black boxes , which might provide clues to what caused the plane to explode .
