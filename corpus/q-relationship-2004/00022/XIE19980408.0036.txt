LAGOS , April 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The operation to repatriate Sierra Leonean refugees from neighboring Guinea has come to a complete halt three weeks since it started .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- , which suspended the exercise , did not give any official reason for the move however , according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here Tuesday night .
The report said the suspension may be partly attributed to Sierra Leones who are making money out of the exercise .
It quoted a UNHCR source as blaming that the tickets issued to registered returnee refugees have been resorted to businessmen and women who are making higher profits from them than from border trade .
The report did not say when the repatriation exercise will resume .
Hundreds of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have fled to neighboring Guinea and Liberia since a coup overthrew the legitimate government last May .
