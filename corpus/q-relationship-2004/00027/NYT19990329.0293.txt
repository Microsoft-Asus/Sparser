<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A large number of monkeys and lemurs in French zoos appear to be infected with the agent that causes mad cow disease</ENAMEX> , according to a provocative study published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Although it is not the first time that the disease has been found in monkeys and lemurs , the extent of the infection is surprising , researchers said .
When 18 apparently healthy lemurs were killed and their tissues examined , every single animal was infected with what looked like mad cow disease .
The finding is bad news for people living in Britain who fear that a human form of mad cow disease , called new variant Creutzfedlt - Jakob disease or CJD , may have similar underpinnings .
For many years , zoo animals throughout Europe were fed protein supplements containing the rendered remains of British cattle , some of which carried a mysterious disease agent called an infectious prion .
A number of species that ate the tainted animal feed , including cats and hoofed animals , developed sponge-like holes in their brains and died in much the same way that British cattle were dying from mad cow disease .
As a result , feed manufacturers stopped adding British beef to their products in 1996 .
That same year , Dr. Noelle Bons , a neurobiologist at Montpellier University in France reported that a rhesus monkey and two lemurs from the local zoo died of a brain disease similar to mad cow disease .
But the link to animal feed could not be proved .
In the study reported Tuesday , Dr. Bons and her colleagues fed a large portion of infected cattle brain to two young lemurs that had never before eaten meat .
One animal received one dose , equivalent to a 154 pound person eating a 1 pound hamburger made entirely from cow brain .
The second animal got two similar doses , a couple of months apart .
After five months , one animal showed `` a loss in vitality '' and was killed by it 's cage mates , Dr. Bons said .
Researchers then killed the other lemur and the tissues of both animals were examined for the presence of infectious prions .
Another 20 lemurs from three French zoos were also killed as part of program to cull certain animals .
Two showed subtle neurological symptoms but the other 18 looked completely normal .
All had eaten animal feed containing British beef for many years .
Finally , three young lemurs that had never eaten beef were also killed ; they showed no signs of infectious prions , Dr. Bons said .
But the two animals intentionally infected and the 20 lemurs living in different zoos showed identical patterns of infection .
In primates , the infection first takes hold in epithelial tissues of the gut , moves to tonsils , esophagus , lymph nodes and spleen and then spreads up the spinal cord to the brain , Dr. Bons said .
This is the first time that such a pattern has been shown in animals incubating a prion disease , said Dr. Paul Brown , a senior research scientist at the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda , Md. and co-author of the paper .
Dr. Bons said that she suspects the pattern is typical of most prion diseases , called spongiform encephalopathies , found in many mammalian species .
Prion diseases take many years to spread , incubate and produce symptoms , though once symptoms appear the disease usually progresses swiftly and is always fatal .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Thus far , 39 people in Britain and one Frenchman have died from new variant CJD , which most experts think is contracted from eating infected beef , particularly brain tissue .</ENAMEX>
