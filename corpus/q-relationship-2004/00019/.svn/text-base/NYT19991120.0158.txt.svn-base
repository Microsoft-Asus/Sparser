ISTANBUL , Turkey --
No visitor in memory has left as positive and potentially far-reaching an impression on Turkey as President Clinton did last week .
Clinton 's vigor and youthful political style sent an unavoidable message for change to a country where the president , prime minister and main opposition leader are all phlegmatic septuagenarians .
Many believe the visit has given Turkey new momentum toward reform .
The enthusiasm with which he plunged into crowds of earthquake victims , entered their tents and shared their tea and misery astonished many Turks , who rarely see their own politicians mix so closely with ordinary people .
Throughout his trip , Clinton seemed determined to encourage forces in Turkish society that defend minority rights and political change .
To show his support for the Greek Orthodox minority , whose leaders sometimes complain that the government does not treat them respectfully enough , Clinton paid a call on the Orthodox patriarch .
Aides said that he expressed sympathy with one of the patriarch 's long-held dreams , the reopening of a religious seminary here that was ordered shut years ago .
Later Clinton met with a group of human rights advocates , including some whose organizations have been in trouble with the government .
Among them were leaders of Mazlum - Der , a Muslim -oriented group whose bank account was frozen to prevent it from sending unauthorized aid to earthquake victims in August , and the Human Rights Association , which government officials have accused of collaborating with terrorists .
`` For the longest time we have lacked leadership and vision in this country , and when I had a chance to speak , I thanked him for giving us some , '' said Kemal Koprulu , one of those who attended the meeting .
Koprulu heads a group that advocates sweeping political change in Turkey .
`` After this visit , people here are yearning for leadership even more than before , '' he said .
`` People have a tendency to think that the whole world is as slow to develop democracy as we are , but now they see that is n't true .
`` Our standards are very low .
Clinton set a benchmark for us .
He put the standard way up there .
He told us we have a few problems to solve , and people are energized to go out and meet the challenge he gave us . ''
Just as significant as the list of people with whom Clinton met was the list of those he ignored .
Although military commanders hold ultimate power in Turkey , Clinton scheduled no meetings with any of them .
Instead he addressed the relatively powerless Parliament , a gesture that aides said was intended to show his support for strengthening civilian power here .
In his speech , Clinton praised Turkey 's progress toward democracy but also asserted , `` There is still far more to be done . ''
Touching on one of the country 's most sensitive challenges , he said he hoped that it would be possible `` for Kurdish citizens of Turkey to reclaim that most basic of birthrights , a normal life . ''
Clearly aligning himself with those who desire more political liberty in Turkey , Clinton said : `` When writers and journalists freely express themselves , they exercise not only a fundamental right , but fuel the exchange of ideals essential to prosperity and growth .
When peaceful outlets exist to express normal human differences , the peace is preserved , not shattered .
When people can celebrate their culture and faith in ways that do not infringe upon the rights of others , moderates do not become extremists , and extremists do not become misguided heroes . ''
Political reformers were ecstatic about the speech and Clinton 's visit in general .
`` I think he 's just great , '' gushed Omer Madra , a radio station manager whose biting commentaries have made him a symbol of impatience with the old order .
`` He 's got to be one of the best American presidents in history . ''
Clinton was careful to mix his calls for democracy with lavish praise for Turkey 's `` ability to bridge east and west , '' gratitude for its `` half a century of friendship , mutual respect and partnership '' with the United States , and praise for `` the great founder of the Turkish Republic , '' Mustafa Kemal Ataturk .
As a result , although small leftist groups staged scattered protests , no prominent figure of any persuasion criticized his message , at least in public .
