The idea that there is specific pairing of nitrogenous bases in DNA was the flash of inspiration that led Watson and Crick to the correct double helix. At the same time, they saw the functional significance of the base-pairing rules. They ended their classic paper with this wry statement: "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." In the next section, you will learn about this basic mechanism of DNA replication. Some important details of the process will be presented in the section that follows.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
