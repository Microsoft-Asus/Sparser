 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago

Cooksonia, named for the paleobotanist Isabel Cookson, is an extinct plant that left fossils over 408 million years old in the Silurian rocks of Europe and North America. It is the earliest-known vascular plant (FIGURE 29.20). Though its branched sporophytes stood only a few centimeters to 50 or so centimeters tall, Cooksonia had small lignified cells similar to the water-conducting cells in the xylem of modern pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). Some of Cooksonia's branches terminated in bulbous sporangia, the sporophyte organs that produce spores.

Fig 29-20. Cooksonia, a vascular plant of the Silurian. The dichotomous (forked like a Y) branching and terminal sporangia characteristic of Cooksonia are evident in the photograph of the fossil on the left. Water-conducting cells were present in true stems, but true roots and leaves were absent. The plant was anchored by a rhizome, a horizontal stem. Cooksonia grew in dense stands around marshes. The largest species was about 50 cm tall.

By Devonian times, 362-408 million years ago, a diversity of vascular plants had evolved, as revealed in the fossil record. The seven extant vascular plant phyla listed in TABLE 29.1 are their descendants, including the two modern phyla of seedless vascular plants.
