An action potential triggered by light striking the eye is the same as an action potential triggered by air vibrating in the ear. The ability to distinguish any type of stimulus, such as sight or sound, depends on the part of the brain that receives the signal. What matters is where impulses go, not what triggers them.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Action potentials that reach the brain via sensory neurons are called <span class="Emphasis2">sensations.</span> Once the brain is aware of sensations, it interprets them, giving us the <span class="Emphasis2">perception</span> of the stimuli. Perceptions, such as colors, smells, sounds, and tastes, are constructions of the brain and do not exist outside it. So, if a tree falls and no one is present to hear it, is there a sound? The fall certainly produces pressure waves in the air, but if sound is defined as a perception, then there is none unless sensory receptors detect the waves and an animal’s brain perceives them.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
