CALI , Colombia --
The long , chaotic line outside the government passport office here begins forming shortly after sunrise .
By the end of the day , as has been the case every workday for more than a year , 800 to 900 passports will be issued to a multitude of Colombians eager to leave a country that has become one of the world 's most lawless and violent .
Many will be headed for the United States .
`` Until the end of 1998 , the high figure had been about 500 a day , and then only during the peak vacation season in July and August , '' said Colombia Medina , the passport department 's weary director .
`` But we no longer have a high or slow season anymore , just a constant flow of people wanting to get out . ''
After four decades of civil conflict and a proliferation of guns and gangs , the forces driving Colombians to abandon their country are perhaps especially acute in this city of 2 million people , best known for its ruthless drug cartels .
But the phenomenon is national , with people of every class leaving from small towns and rural areas as well as large cities .
By government estimates , 800,000 people -- 2 percent of Colombia 's total population of 40 million -- have left the country in the last four years .
The expectation is that the exodus has not yet reached its peak because the country 's problems are no nearer a solution .
And the prospect of a $ 1.6 billion , two-year aid package from the United States has not eased Colombians ' anxieties .
Political violence continues to rise and left-wing guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups increasingly use kidnapping and extortion to finance their war with each other and the state .
Colombia 's murder rate is 10 times that of the United States , and last year 2,663 kidnappings were reported .
Both rates , experts say , are the world 's highest .
Such statistics , abstract as they are , have left the average citizen with a very real feeling that there is no longer a safe haven to be found anywhere on Colombian soil .
The raw numbers of people leaving are alarming enough , but because many of those exiting are highly educated professionals , including engineers , architects and doctors , the accelerating exodus has become a deep source of concern here .
`` Colombia in its entirety has been transformed into a giant travel agency , '' Juan Fernando Cristo complained in a recent column in El Espectador , a major national daily .
`` Everyone seems disposed to emigrate , and nothing could be worse for the country than this growing phenomenon and the subsequent loss of human talent , productivity and earnings . ''
For many Cali residents , a turning point came last spring when a unit of one of the country 's leftist guerrilla groups , the People 's Liberation Army , raided a church in an affluent neighborhood during Sunday Mass and took more than 150 hostages for ransom .
In addition , guerrilla groups now operate at will in the surrounding countryside , setting up roadblocks , halting vehicles to check the identities of passengers , and , in a practice known in Colombian slang as `` miraculous fishing , '' kidnapping those whose names appear in a laptop computer registry of the rich and prominent .
Affluent neighborhoods of the city are apparently no safer : On Wednesday , three teen-agers were kidnapped on their way to an elite private school .
One man waiting in line for a passport last week was Luis Alberto Guevara , 28 , a former investigator at the prosecutor 's office here .
He now works for an airport security company , but has obtained a visa that will allow him to move to Florida and do the same work there .
The environment , he said , is certain to be `` much calmer and less dangerous . ''
`` The level of insecurity here is growing tremendously , and so our work becomes increasingly dangerous , with constant threats from all sides , '' he said .
`` I do not want my children to have to live through what we have lived through . ''
One prominent family recently began moving to Florida after suffering through three kidnappings of family members by guerrillas , paying a ransom each time .
They are trying to liquidate their businesses and properties and shift the rest of their assets to the United States .
`` I love this country , but the situation here has become unbearable , '' said a family member who is still here , coordinating the transfer , and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears that he , too , could be kidnapped .
`` Anyone with a decent economic situation is trying to get out , '' he said , `` because no matter how many ransoms you pay , you are never fully vaccinated against the guerrillas , and the police or even private security can provide no protection . ''
The affluent are not the only ones giving up .
Working -class Colombians are also leaving in growing numbers .
Armando Berenguez , a 32-year -old taxi driver , is about to go to Spain , leaving his wife and 10-year -old child behind until he can find a job `` at a hotel or in construction or anything that is honest '' and a place for his family to live .
`` You do n't dare take a fare out past the city limits here anymore because the guerrillas will stop you at one of their roadblocks and kidnap you and your passenger and take your car , '' he said when asked why he was leaving .
`` It happens all the time to people I know , and when you 've had your car taken from you like that , there is no way you can make a living . ''
Some of those leaving are unemployed and would ordinarily be regarded as economic immigrants .
But they are quick to reject that label , pointing out that the recession Colombia is currently living through , its worst in 70 years , has its origins in the guerrilla conflict , which has intensified in recent years as efforts to find a settlement have deadlocked .
`` The rich are getting themselves and their money out of the country as fast as they can , and the guerrillas keep on bombing power pylons and oil pipelines , which makes the foreign companies afraid to invest here , '' said Juan Carlos Rios , 28 , an electrician about to head for the Netherlands Antilles , where a sister-in-law works as a hotel chambermaid .
`` That means there is no work for people like me , and we become victims of a crisis we did not create . ''
In an effort to curb the drug trafficking profits that allow the guerrillas to buy weapons , recruit fighters and maintain a huge network of informants , the Clinton administration is proposing a $ 1.6 billion two-year emergency aid package for Colombia .
But that plan , too , seems to be contributing to the jitters that are driving Colombians abroad .
`` If things are this bad now , what is going to happen when all the gringo money gets here ? '' asked Juan Pablo Robles , 34 , a technician who is about to go to Spain .
`` The whole country is going to become a war zone . ''
According to statistics provided by the U.S. Embassy in Bogota , Colombians are seeking entry to the United States at a record rate : 366,423 applied for nonimmigrant visas last year , compared with 150,514 in 1997 .
About three-quarters of the requests for nonimmigrant visas and just over half of the 11,345 applications for immigrant visas were granted last year , embassy records indicate .
The preferred destinations of Colombians fleeing to the United States are said to be Miami , New York City and parts of New England .
Large Colombian immigrant communities are already well established there and newcomers can hope to be received warmly by relatives , former neighbors or schoolmates .
`` Going to the United States remains the dream of most of those who are leaving , '' said Medina , the passport official .
`` But getting an American visa can be a real problem , so a lot of people are also going to Spain '' or to nearby countries like Costa Rica , which does not require visas of Colombians .
Applications for political asylum in the United States , while still small in absolute terms , have also begun to rise , as has the approval rate for such claims , according to Immigration and Naturalization Service figures .
In the last quarter of 1999 , the agency received 396 political asylum requests from Colombians , compared with 334 in the previous 12 months , and the approval rate rose from 19 percent in 1998 to 46 percent by the end of last year .
According to the Colombian government agency that oversees immigration matters , at least 565,000 Colombians , or one of every five travelers , who left the country from 1996 to 1998 did not return .
Final figures for 1999 are still being compiled , but government officials say everything points to a sharp increase in the rate of departure .
Picking up on the trend , the newspaper El Tiempo recently published what it called `` an inventory of reasons not to leave for the United States . ''
These ranged from `` You really have to stop completely at stop signs '' and `` There are not as many holidays , '' to even more fanciful considerations like `` The natives do not know how to dance either salsa or merengue '' and the coffee and chocolate are inferior .
Just a decade ago , `` the extraditable leaders of the drug cartels said they preferred ` a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States , ' '' the newspaper reminded its readers .
But `` many Colombians today prefer any space whatsoever in the colossus of the north to a moral , physical , psychological , or employment tomb here in our own country . ''
