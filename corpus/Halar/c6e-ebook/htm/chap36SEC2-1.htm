Here we reexamine a few of these transport processes in the specific context of plant cells.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The selective permeability of a plant cell’s plasma membrane controls the movement of solutes between the cell and the extracellular solution. Recall from Chapter 8 that solutes tend to diffuse down their gradients, and when this occurs across a membrane, the process is termed passive transport--<span class="Emphasis1">passive</span> because it happens without the direct expenditure of metabolic energy by the cell. Most solutes, however, cross a membrane very slowly unless they can pass through <span class="Emphasis2">transport proteins</span> embedded in the membrane. Some of these facilitate diffusion by binding selectively to a solute on one side of the membrane and releasing the solute on the opposite side. Transfer of the solute across the membrane involves a conformational (shape) change by the transport protein. Other transport proteins function as <span class="Emphasis2">selective channels,</span> which are simply selective passageways across the membrane. For example, the membranes of most plant cells have potassium channels that allow potassium ions (K<SUP>+</SUP>) to pass, but not similar ions, such as sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>). Some channels are gated;that is, certain environmental or biochemical stimuli can cause the channels to open or close. Later in this chapter, we will see how gated K<SUP>+</SUP> channels in the membranes of guard cells function in the opening and closing of stomata.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Recall also from Chapter 8 that active transport is the pumping of solutes across membranes against their electrochemical gradients, the combined effects of the solute’s concentration gradient and the voltage (charge difference) across the membrane. It is termed <span class="Emphasis1">active</span> because the cell must expend metabolic energy, usually in the form of ATP, to transport a solute "uphill"--that is, counter to the direction in which the solute diffuses. Transport proteins that simply facilitate diffusion, such as selective channels, cannot perform active transport. The active transporters are a special class of membrane proteins, each responsible for pumping specific solutes.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
