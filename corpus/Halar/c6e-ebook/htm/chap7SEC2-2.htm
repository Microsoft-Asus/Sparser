The objective is to break the cells apart without damaging their organelles. Spinning the soupy homogenate in a centrifuge at low speed separates the parts of the cell into two fractions: the pellet, consisting of the larger, heavier structures that become packed at the bottom of the test tube; and the supernatant, consisting of the smaller, lighter parts of the cell suspended in the liquid above the pellet. The supernatant is decanted into another tube and centrifuged again at a higher speed. The process is repeated, increasing the speed with each step, collecting smaller and smaller components of the homogenized cells in successive pellets.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Cell fractionation enables the researcher to prepare specific components of cells in bulk quantity in order to study their composition and functions. By following this approach, biologists have been able to assign various functions of the cell to the different organelles, a task that would be far more difficult with intact cells. For example, one cellular fraction collected by centrifugation has enzymes that function in the metabolic process known as cellular respiration. The electron microscope reveals this fraction to be very rich in the organelles called mitochondria. This evidence helped cell biologists determine that mitochondria are the sites of cellular respiration. Cytology and biochemistry complement each other in correlating cellular structure and function.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
