The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided in Vienna Wednesday to continue cutting production of crude oil , a move expected to insure high prices for crude and high retail prices for gasoline and heating oil this winter .
After a two-day meeting , the 11 OPEC ministers said in a statement that their countries would maintain production cuts through March 2000 and then decide on further action .
The price of crude oil has more than doubled since the cuts were first put into effect last March , going from a low of $ 11 early this year to nearly $ 24 Wednesday .
The spike in prices , which the production cutbacks are intended to continue , has had a ripple effect on a broad range of petroleum derivatives .
Prices for gasoline have risen more than 25 percent and are not dropping despite the end of the heavy summer driving season , which usually ushers in lower prices .
The price of home heating oil is expected to begin rising shortly , as demand begins to kick in with cooler weather .
The Energy Department estimates that home heating oil will cost consumers about 30 percent more than last year , on average .
`` The consumer will get socked big time , `` said Fred Leuffer , an oil analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co .
OPEC countries suffered a huge loss of revenue because of a plunge in crude oil prices last year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The cutbacks by OPEC , as well as by other major producers like Mexico and Norway , could send prices for crude and refined products even higher in the months ahead , some analysts warned</ENAMEX> .
Retail prices of petroleum products in this country have been going up for months .
The average price of self-serve regular gasoline rose to $ 1.268 a gallon this week , up 1.8 cents from a week ago , according to a survey of 800 gasoline stations made by the Energy Department .
A year ago , prices were about $ 1 a gallon .
The department 's Energy Information Administration projects that the price will average $ 1.24 for regular gasoline in the first quarter of next year , compared with 95 cents in the first quarter of last year .
The agency also expects that heating oil , which averaged about 80 cents a gallon last winter , will cost an average of about $ 1.04 this winter .
Although natural gas is not directly affected by OPEC , prices have also risen substantially this year , until recently , and are also expected to be much higher this winter than last year .
With demand rising , the supply of natural gas has not increased significantly because of a major slowdown in drilling that began last year , when many companies cut back on spending because of falling prices .
In an unusual show of unity , OPEC has held firm since March when it put in cuts that reduced oil production by about 4.3 million barrels a day from the levels of February .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">With the support of non- OPEC members , including Mexico and Norway , which in the past kept pumping all they could while OPEC held back , the major oil producing nations have been able to largely eliminate a glut of oil that built up last year and caused prices to fall</ENAMEX> .
Combined with an economic recovery in Asia and strong demand elsewhere , the cuts have led to a sustained resurgence in the price of crude oil .
In the short term , Leuffer and other analysts said , crude could go much higher , perhaps to $ 30 a barrel .
They said , however , that some of the world 's largest producers such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela would then increase production for fear of cooling demand and undermining the world 's major economies , most of which are heavily dependent on imported oil .
The decision to keep the cuts in place comes at a time when inventories have been dropping and demand continues to be strong .
The International Energy Agency , which is based in Paris and tracks world energy trends , predicted this month that demand for crude oil would grow by 2.5 percent next year , which would be the largest annual increase since 1997 .
The agency said that consumption would total 77.1 million barrels a day next year , compared with 75.2 million barrels a day this year .
Edgard Habib , a Middle East specialist with the agency , said that OPEC must be careful not to let the price go too high because it could stifle the Asian recovery .
In the end , he said , if prices go high enough , this would stimulate production of non- OPEC oil .
In an indication that tensions continue within OPEC , the organization failed Wednesday to agree on a new secretary-general , and the incumbent , Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria , will extend his term at least until next March 's meeting .
Some analysts believe that OPEC will have to ease up on its cutbacks and actually increase production next year to prevent a huge run-up in price .
`` Things look awfully tight , '' Leuffer said .
`` In order to balance the market , OPEC will have to increase production substantially , by more than 2.5 million barrels a day . ''
But for this winter , at least , there seems little relief in sight for consumers who enjoyed unusually low energy prices last year .
Dave Costello , an International Energy Agency economist , said that for the short term , `` the fundamentals will keep an upward pressure on prices . ''
He added , `` The consumer will be paying more for goods related to petroleum . ''
