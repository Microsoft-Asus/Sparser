AMMAN , Jordan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Jordan signed a global land mine treaty Saturday , joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact , which prohibits the use , production and stockpiling of the weapon .
The announcement was made by Queen Noor , King Hussein 's American -born wife .
`` I would like to begin by announcing with great pride and hope that , as of this morning , the Jordanian Cabinet approved the signing of the Ottawa convention , '' Noor told more than 250 people from more than 20 countries at a conference on land mines .
Delegates at the two-day meeting are discussing ways of assisting mine victims in the Middle East .
It is hosted by the Landmine Survivors Network , a private organization based in Washington , D.C. The Ottawa convention , which was reached in Canada last December , has been signed by 127 nations .
Only 10 countries , however , have ratified the treaty , which prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transferring of anti-personal land mines .
In her 30-minute address , Noor said that Jordan stopped importing land mines in 1974 `` and will never import them anymore . ''
But she stressed that Jordan needs technical assistance and equipment to clear the 185,000 remaining mines , the bulk of them planted along the border with Israel since the 1967 Middle East war .
Jordan has already cleared 65,000 mines in the last five years , but its efforts have slow , apparently because of the lack of the necessary equipment , said Jerry White , executive director of the Landmine Survivors Network .
Nasser Majali , a Jordanian army general responsible for clearing mines , said that from 1973 until 1993 more then 80 Jordanians were killed and 621 injured , including 400 civilians , from mines .
Since March 1993 , only 29 people were injured and there were no deaths , Majali added .
