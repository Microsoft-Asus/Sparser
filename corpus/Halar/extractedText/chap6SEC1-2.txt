ENZYMES

 

 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers



 

 Enzymes are substrate specific



 

 The active site is an enzyme's catalytic center



 

 A cell's physical and chemical environment affects enzyme activity



The laws of thermodynamics tell us what can and cannot happen under given conditions but say nothing about the speed of these processes. A spontaneous chemical reaction may occur so slowly that it is imperceptible. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose (FIGURE 6.11) is exergonic, occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy (DG = - 7 kcal/mol). Yet a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis. But if we add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase to the solution, then all the sucrose may be hydrolyzed within seconds. How does an enzyme do this?
