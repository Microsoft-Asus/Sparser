These plants are particularly common and diverse in moist alpine, boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, as well as wetlands, where they form essential habitats for a variety of tiny animals. Some mosses even inhabit such extreme environments as mountaintops, arctic and antarctic tundra, and deserts; similarly harsh habitats likely challenged the earliest plants. Mosses are able to exist in very cold or dry habitats because many are able to lose most of their body water without dying, then rehydrate and reactivate their cells when moisture again becomes available. In contrast, few vascular plants can survive the same degree of desiccation. Moreover, phenolic compounds in moss cell walls absorb damaging levels of UV and other short-wavelength radiation present in deserts or at high altitudes and latitudes.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">One moss genus is especially abundant and widespread. <span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span> is a wetland moss that forms extensive deposits of undecayed organic material known as <span class="Emphasis2">peat.</span> Thus, <span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span> is also called peat moss. Boggy regions dominated by this moss are known as peat bogs (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.19</span>), and extensive high-latitude boreal regions occupied by <span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span> are among the wetlands called peatlands. <span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span> and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the resistant phenolic compounds embedded in the moss’s cell walls. <span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span> moss also secretes acidic and phenolic compounds that may reduce bacterial activity. Low temperatures and nutrient levels typical of peat bogs also inhibit microbial decay.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-19','../fig/big/fig29-19.jpg','fig29-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-19.jpg" alt="fig29-19" name="myfig29-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Sphagnum</span>, or peat moss.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The world’s peatlands store an estimated 400 billion tons of organic carbon.
