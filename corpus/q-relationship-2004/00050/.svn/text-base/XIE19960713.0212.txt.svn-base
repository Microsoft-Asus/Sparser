CARACAS , July 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Venezuela deplored a U.S. government decision to cancel Colombian President Ernesto Samper 's entry visa for his alleged links with drug cartels there .
In a statement released today , Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said they deplored the U.S. move since Samper represents not an individual but a whole country .
Parliamentarians and diplomats have deplored Washington 's decision and forecast an impending intensified conflict between both countries .
Professor of the Central University of Venezuela Carlos Romero proposed an urgent meeting of the Organization of American States -LRB- OAS -RRB- to study the current situation with reference to the 1991 Santiago Commitment .
Under the commitment , member countries of the OAS are committed to condemn any action jeopardizing the democracy of the region including military coups and external interference .
Previously , Samper 's defense minister Fernando Botero had accused him of accepting narco-money from Cali drug cartel , the biggest cocaine syndicate in the world in the 1994 election campaign which brought him to power .
After investigations the Colombian Congress exonerated him from such charges early this year .
The U.S. move came in response to Colombia 's rejection some days ago of a U.S. request to extradite four detained Colombian drug traffickers most wanted by the United States .
Observers believed the cancellation of Samper 's entry visa may be a prelude to severe U.S. economic sanctions against this South American country .
