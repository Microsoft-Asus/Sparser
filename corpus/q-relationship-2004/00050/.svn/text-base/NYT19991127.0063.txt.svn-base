Microsoft Faces Flurry Of Class - Action Suits Microsoft 's antitrust troubles are attracting a growing number of class-action lawyers .
Three long-time class-action lawyers filed a suit on behalf of millions of computer users in California , alleging that the users were overcharged for Microsoft 's Windows operating system .
Those lawyers were soon followed by Stanley Chesley , a longtime opponent of the tobacco industry who filed suit in Ohio .
The suits came in the wake of a federal judge 's findings of fact earlier this month in the Justice Department 's case against Microsoft .
The judge concluded that Microsoft was a monopoly that had harmed consumers .
The class-action lawyers , however , must prove their cases largely on their own , against a company with deep pockets and skilled lawyers .
Iraq Cuts Oil Sales Iraq cut off the oil it is allowed to export in exchange for food , medicine and other supplies , protesting a two-week stop-gap extension of the U.N. Nations program , which is normally rolled over for six months .
The goods will continue to arrive , however , because many orders were in the works when the Security Council deadlocked over whether to alter the terms of the program , which allows President Saddam Hussein to sell limited quantities of oil to mitigate the effects of stringent international sanctions .
Security Council members hope to renew the program this week , unchanged , for another six months .

Ferry Disaster in China The ferry boat , with more than 300 passengers and crew on board , set out from China 's northeastern port of Yantai for the journey north to Dalian .
In a blinding snowstorm with high winds and waves , the ferry somehow caught fire and the extreme conditions prevented rescue ships from approaching .
When the burning vessel began to sink , lifeboats were swamped and most of the passengers who donned life jackets and jumped into the icy waters perished .
Only 22 people were confirmed as surviving one of China 's worst ship disasters in decades , and the government immediately opened an inquiry into the cause .
U.S. Economy Steams Ahead The government 's latest snapshot of the nation 's $ 8.9 trillion economy revealed even more momentum than had been thought .
With employment , incomes , consumer optimism and stock market indexes all at or near peaks , the Commerce Department raised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to an annual rate of 5.5 percent , from 4.8 .
percent .
That pace surpassed nearly all predictions .
`` How can you not be thankful ? '' asked James Glassman , chief U.S. economist at Chase Securities .
But some analysts warned that unless the growth slows sharply , the Federal Reserve could feel compelled to raise interest rates again and threaten the long-running expansion .
Domestic Abuse by Women Accepted wisdom among sociologists who study domestic abuse holds that 95 percent of batterers are men .
But in certain spots , from Concord , N.H. to Boulder County , Colo. , 25 percent or more of recent arrests for domestic assault have been of women .
Experts agree that the arrest rates are an unexpected consequence of tougher laws and procedures introduced in recent years mainly to help women by forcing police and courts to crack down on brutal men .
But the experts disagree on the root cause : many say most of the women arrested are acting in self-defense .
Others say women are more violent in their homes than usually thought .
All concur that the phenomenon is complex and worth further study .
Bad News for Boxing Group The 15-year -old International Boxing Federation , staggered by the Nov. 4 indictment of its top officials for allegedly extorting money from fighters for preferred rankings and shots at lucrative championship bouts , received more bad news .
The U.S. attorney for New Jersey asked a federal judge to appoint a monitor to take over the organization and its ranking functions .
In making the request under the civil provisions of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act , prosecutors labeled the boxing group a corrupt enterprise in need of immediate reform .
The organization , with headquarters in East Orange , N.J. , is the only one of the three sanctioning groups for boxing based in the United States .
If the request is granted , the group would become the first sports organization to come under federal court supervision amid racketeering allegations .
