Cuba is subject to strict sanctions by the United States and has been desperately short of oil since 1989 .
Rodriguez said that under the so-called Pact of San Jose , Venezuela and Mexico provide oil under easy payment conditions to 11 Caribbean and Central America countries .
Cuba , now excluded from the group , will soon be covered , he added .
In 1994 , Mexico agreed to invest 200 million U.S. dollars in Cuba 's Cienfuegos refinery , which also involved an oil supply agreement .
But that deal fell apart on financial problems .
