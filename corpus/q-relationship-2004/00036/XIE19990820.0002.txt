WASHINGTON , August 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">China 's consistent policy on the Taiwan question is peaceful reunification on the basis of `` one country , two systems '' , but it refuses to rule out the use of force , Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing said at a press conference here Thursday .
`` We refuse to rule out the use of force .
We keep that option open not to target at the people in Taiwan , but to stop possible Taiwan independence and foreign invasion or intervention against the island , '' Li Zhaoxing said .</ENAMEX>
The Chinese government and people have both the determination and capability to maintain China 's sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity , Li said .
Lee Teng -hui , the so-called `` President '' of Taiwan , could avoid total condemnation only if he abandons his `` state-to-state '' fallacy and returns to the `` one China '' principle , he added .
Commenting on the recent remarks by some American politicians that the U.S. would protect Taiwan militarily should China use force on Taiwan , the ambassador said that Chinese people love peace and long for peace , but they will not be cowed by threats and blackmails from anyone .
`` Taiwan is part of China .
It is not Florida , Hawaii or Guam .
The Taiwan issue is China 's internal affair which brooks no foreign interference , '' he said .
He said China has noted the U.S. government has committed to follow the `` one China '' policy , abide by the three joint communiques , and not to support Taiwan independence , `` two Chinas '' or `` one China , one Taiwan '' and Taiwan 's membership in the U.N. and other international organizations where statehood is required .
`` Only Lee Teng -hui wants a military flare-up between China and U.S. , '' he said , `` he wants Americans to do things for him at their expense . ''
`` What is in there for the vital U.S. interests ?
I hope people with vision in this country can understand this and judge wisely . ''
The ambassador accused Lee Teng -hui of `` racking his brains '' to undermine China - U.S. relations and to damage the basis for cross- Straits dialog in an attempt to seek Taiwan independence .
`` Lee Teng -hui 's motive for putting forth the ` state-to-state ' doctrine is crystal clear .
The crux of the matter is that he is after Taiwan independence , denying the `` one China '' principle and separating Taiwan from China , '' Li Zhaoxing said .
`` Facts show that Lee Teng -hui is the biggest obstacle to the cross- Straits dialog and China 's peaceful reunification .
He is the biggest trouble-maker for China - U.S. relations .
And for the time being , he is also the biggest destabilizing factor in the Asia -pacific region , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">On the question of Taiwan 's entry into World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , the ambassador said as a separate customs territory of China , Taiwan can join the WTO only after China has become its member .</ENAMEX>
