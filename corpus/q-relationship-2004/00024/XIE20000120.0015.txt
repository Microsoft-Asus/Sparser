ANKARA , January 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Thursday that it is possible to solve the Cyprus issue through dialogue between Turkey and Greece .
Ecevit made the remarks while meeting with visiting Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou , who arrived here later Wednesday for a three-day official visit .
He said the two countries can speed up their rapprochement process by cooperating in the fields of economy , culture , tourism and anti-crime drive .
He also invited his Greek counterpart Constantinos Simitis to visit Turkey .
Earlier in the day , Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Papandreou signed four agreements on tourism , environment , investments and fighting terrorism , organized crime , illegal immigration and drug trafficking following their talks .
The agreements were designed to build confidence between the two long-time rivals before they tackle more contentious issues such as Cyprus and the Aegean Sea disputes which have led the two Aegean neighbors to the brink of war three times during the past 25 years .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Turko - Greek ties have been improved steadily since the two countries rushed aid to each other following devastating earthquakes last summer and Greece dropped its objection to Turkey 's European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- candidacy at the EU Helsinki summit last December</ENAMEX> .
At a joint press conference held after the talks , Papandreou said that Greece will help press for Turkey 's membership in the EU .
Cem said that Greece will advise Turkey on the legal and administrative steps that Turkey must take to win membership .
The Turkish minister also proposed to set up a working group to discuss `` military goodwill measures , '' including reducing the size and extent of military exercises in the Aegean Sea where Turkish and Greek warplanes sometimes stage mock dogfights .
But Papandreou said he needs to discuss the offer with the Greek defense ministry .
Analysts said that Papandreou 's visit shows that the Turko - Greek ties have entered an important stage .
