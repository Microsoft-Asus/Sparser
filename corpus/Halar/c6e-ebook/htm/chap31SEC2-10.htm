Without decomposers, carbon, nitrogen, and other elements would become tied up in organic matter. Plants and the animals they feed would starve because elements taken from the soil would not be returned (see Chapter 54).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Fungi are well adapted as decomposers of plant material. Their invasive hyphae enter the tissues and cells of dead organic matter, secreting exoenzymes that hydrolyze polymers, including the cellulose and lignin of plant cell walls. A succession of fungi, in concert with bacteria and, in some environments, invertebrate animals, are responsible for the complete breakdown of plant litter. The air is so loaded with fungal spores that as soon as a leaf falls or an insect dies, it is covered with spores and is soon infiltrated by saprobic hyphae.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">We may applaud fungi that decompose forest litter or dung, but it is a different story when molds attack our fruit or our shower curtains. Between 10%  and 50%  of the world’s fruit harvest is lost each year to fungal attack. Ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, also stimulates fungal spores on the fruit surface to germinate. This timing mechanism allows fungi to invade when fruit is most vulnerable and nutritious. A wood-digesting saprobe does not distinguish between a fallen oak limb and the oak planks of a boat. During the Revolutionary War, the British lost more ships to fungal rot than to enemy attack. Soldiers stationed in the tropics during World War II watched their tents, clothing, boots, and binoculars be destroyed by molds. Some fungi can even decompose certain plastics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
