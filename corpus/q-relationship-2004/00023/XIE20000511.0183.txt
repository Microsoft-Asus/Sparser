GENEVA , May 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United Nations Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- has called on all parties in Sierra Leone to keep their promises of not recruiting child soldiers , according to a UNICEF press release made available here Thursday .
`` We 're very concerned right now about the threat to children , '' said Joanna Van Gerpen , head of UNICEF 's office in Sierra Leone .
'' The very high level of instability could lead us back into the vicious cycle where children are used as tools of war .
This war is the business of adults -- children should n't be forced to pay the price . ''
She said that the current crisis in the country could result in the renewed recruitment of child soldiers , a practice that most military leaders have repeatedly disavowed in the last two years .
UNICEF estimates that during Sierra Leone 's nine-year civil war , some 5,000 children , mostly boys , were used as combatants .
Thousands of other boys and girls were abducted and forced to become wood gatherers , cooks , sex slaves or porters for the military .
Sierra Leone was one of the first countries in the world to sign the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Van Gerpen said that nearly 1,700 former child combatants had been `` demobilized '' since the signing of the Lome peace accords last July and the commencement of the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration program .
