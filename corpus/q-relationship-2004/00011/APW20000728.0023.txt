MIAMI
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- A federal judge has refused to move the trial of four accused Cuban spies out of Miami .
Defense attorneys had argued that extensive coverage by the city 's news media of Cuban -related stories -- including the Elian Gonzalez saga -- would make it impossible to seat an impartial jury .
The four are part of a group of 14 people accused of trying to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Florida .
Five others have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify at the trial , which begins Sept. 5 .
The spy ring is said to be the largest Cuban espionage operation uncovered in the United States in decades .
The people named in Thursday 's ruling includes alleged spymaster Gerardo Hernandez , who is charged with murder conspiracy .
He allegedly supplied Cuba with information about two planes flown by an exile group in 1996 .
Cuban fighter jets shot the planes down , killing all four men aboard .
