ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Iran 's foreign minister praised Pakistan for its nuclear tests -- offering some solace amid near-worldwide disapproval .
Muslims in the Middle East long had worried about Israel 's nuclear capability , said Kamal Kharrazi , the first foreign dignitary to visit Pakistan since the blasts occurred .
`` Now , they feel confident , '' because a fellow Islamic nation possesses the know-how to build nuclear weapons , he said .
Other Islamic nations expressed concern about the nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India , citing the threat to peace .
In New Delhi on Monday , India announced an increase in its defense spending , despite the hardships expected from international sanctions imposed after its own nuclear tests .
Also Monday , India rejected reports it was planning another nuclear test .
Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan 's claims that India was surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was `` surprising '' -- and wrong .
`` India has declared a moratorium on testing , and this has been reiterated by the prime minister himself , '' Singh said .
His ministry reiterated India 's long-standing call for international talks on reducing nuclear weapons in a statement Sunday .
India 's five tests May 11-13 escalated the long-standing Indo - Pakistan rivalry to the nuclear level .
Pakistan reponded with what it said were six detonations of its own ; five on Friday and one on Saturday .
Pakistan has not said whether it will test again ; U.S. intelligence sources say they have detected no signs that either Pakistan or India is readying new tests .
Speaking at a news conference Monday , Kharrazi defended Pakistan 's tests , saying India left Pakistan no choice .
`` As a matter of its national security and to create a balance in the region , '' Pakistan had to respond with its own nuclear tests , he said .
`` Over the world , Muslims are happy that Pakistan has this capability . ''
The leader of the militant Palestinian Hamas group , Sheik Ahmed Yassin , echoed the Iranian leader , calling Pakistan 's nuclear capability `` an asset to the Arab and Muslim nations . ''
But a leading Islamic organization expressed `` deep concern '' over the tests and urged immediate talks by India and Pakistan .
The `` international community must seriously encourage both India and Pakistan to expediently conclude a nonaggression agreement with the aim of ensuring the promotion of peace and security in the region , '' the Organization of the Islamic Conference said in a statement Monday in Jiddah , Saudi Arabia .
China , an ally of Pakistan , said it would urge world powers to find a way to halt the nuclear arms race when foreign ministers of the U.N. Security Council 's permanent members meet later this week in Geneva .
Kharrazi dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow Pakistan with tests of its own .
`` We do n't have any nuclear weapons program , '' Kharrazi said .
`` What we have is for peaceful purposes . ''
Iran has repeatedly denied U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is close to building a nuclear weapon .
Kharrazi said Iran 's nuclear facilities are open to international inspectors .
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged last week to safeguard his country 's nuclear technology and not to share it with any other nation .
Meanwhile , India 's new Hindu nationalist government unveiled a budget Monday that included a 14 percent increase in defense spending -- and a hefty 68 percent increase in spending on atomic energy .
The country 's space program , which includes missiles , also got a 62 percent budget increase .
India has threatened to step up military activity on its side of the troubled Kashmir border -- the flash point of two previous wars between the two countries .
They fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh , or what was then East Pakistan .
Pakistan accused India of preparing to attack its nuclear sites last week , and scrambled its own air force and put its soldiers on alert .
The latest accusation came from Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub who said his country had `` credible evidence '' that India was preparing a second site to test nuclear weapons .
India denied the accusation .
