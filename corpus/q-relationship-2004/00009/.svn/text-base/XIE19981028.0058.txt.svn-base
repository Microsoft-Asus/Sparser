ANKARA , October 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The U.S. will continue to support the Baku - Ceyhan pipeline project aimed at transporting the Caspian oil to the European markets .
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Mark Parris made the remarks Tuesday at a seminar held in Istanbul on U.S. investment in the Caspian region , the Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday .
He said the U.S. administration will back the building of the pipeline that links Baku , capital of Azerbaijan , to Ceyhan , Turkey 's Mediterranean port .
The feasibility study for the pipeline that can carry 50 million tonnes -LRB- 7.1 million barrels -RRB- of oil a year has been completed in August and it is planned to be put into operation in 2003 .
`` The east-west energy corridor should be the Baku - Ceyhan pipeline , '' Parris said .
He dismissed as `` premature , untimely and misleading '' press reports that U.S. oil companies involved in the region have found the pipeline unfeasible .
All scenarios need to be taken into consideration , Parris said , but he warned that shipment of the region 's oil through the Bosphrous Straits will strain the Turkish waterway .
`` The capacity of the Bosphrous -LRB- to handle oil shipments -RRB- is limited , '' the U.S. ambassador said .
The Baku - Ceyhan pipeline is vying with other plans to carry the region 's abundant oil and natural gas to the European markets .
Russia has proposed the usage of an existing small pipeline between Baku and Russian Black Sea port of Novorossisk and Georgia backs construction of a pipeline to its Black Sea port of Soupsa .
Turkey firmly supports the Baku - Ceyhan pipeline because the project will provide oil and natural gas to the energy-starving country and it will earn a considerable transportation fee every year .
Azerbaijan 's oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are considered to be the world 's second richest after the Middle East .
The Azerbaijan 's oil started flowing through the Russian pipeline in 1997 to Novorossisk and beyond .
