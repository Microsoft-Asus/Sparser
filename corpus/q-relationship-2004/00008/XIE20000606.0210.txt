TOKYO , June 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday sentenced former AUM Shinrikyo member Yoshihiro Inoue to life in prison for murder and other crimes related to 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system that killed 12 people and injured thousands , Kyodo News reported .
Inoue , 30 , was one of the closest aides to AUM founder Shoko Asahara .
In addition to the murder of the sarin gas attack victims , he was found guilty of taking part in other cases of murder and kidnapping .
The public prosecutors have demanded the death sentence for Inoue , but the call was rejected by the presiding judge on the ground that the defendant did not play an active role in the crimes , such as releasing sarin in the subway trains .
Koichi Ueda , a senior official at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office , said he did not expect the ruling to be life imprisonment for such serious crimes .
Ueda said he plans to appeal the ruling after discussing the case with the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office .
The court also rejected a defense plea that Inoue followed Asahara 's orders under `` mind control '' , therefore , he was not fully responsible for his actions .
A 29-year -old woman whose father was killed in the sarin attack was quoted by Kyodo as saying , `` It was a completely unexpected ruling .
I 'm confused , to be honest . ''
Takeshi Tsuchimoto , a professor of the Penal Code at Teikyo University , told the Japanese news agency that the court should have handed down the death penalty , because Inoue planned , prepared and carried out so many lethal crimes .
