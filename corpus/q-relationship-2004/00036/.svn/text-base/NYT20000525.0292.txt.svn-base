HONG KONG --
For a city that has prospered as an intermediary between the Chinese economy and the outside world , Hong Kong has lobbied hard to help China win full membership in the world 's club of trading nations .
Now the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to give China permanent normal trade status , bringing normalized trade relations closer to reality and easing China 's accession to the World Trade Organization .
And Hong Kong has to begin facing the consequences of its successful campaign , one that has been driven at least as much by politics as by economics .
A China more open to commerce with the outside world , many experts say , will jeopardize Hong Kong 's historic role as a trading post .
`` There 's no question that companies are going to do business directly with China , '' said Robert C. Broadfoot , the managing director of the Political & Economic Risk Consultancy here .
`` It 's not a question of if , but when , you 're going to have shocks to Hong Kong 's role . ''
Broadfoot contends that in the long run Hong Kong will benefit from China 's integration into the global economy , because the overall volume of China -related trade will grow .
But in the short term , China 's march into the World Trade Organization will pose a thorny challenge .
As a former British colony and now a semiautonomous region of China , Hong Kong is a separate trading entity that already has its own membership in the WTO. Hong Kong 's stock market reflected this ambivalence , falling slightly on Thursday while shares in the mainland Chinese cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen roared ahead .
In 1998 , more than $ 52 billion worth of goods passed through Hong Kong 's port bound for mainland destinations .
Broadfoot estimates that a third of that traffic will disappear after the United States and other countries start shipping directly to mainland ports .
Likewise in air travel , Hong Kong could lose its role as a gateway to China .
As part of the WTO negotiations last year between the United States and China , Beijing agreed to increase the frequency of commercial flights , which would enable more American cities to have more direct flights to mainland Chinese cities .
That could hurt Dragonair , a Hong Kong carrier that serves many mainland cities .
It stands to lose Western passengers who fly to Hong Kong and transfer to planes to popular Chinese destinations like Xian or Guilin .
Hong Kong 's position is further threatened by Taiwan , whose new president , Chen Shui -bian , has signaled that he is open to negotiating direct trade links with China .
In 1998 , Hong Kong 's container port handled nearly $ 10 billion worth of Taiwanese exports bound for China .
If Taiwan and China were to break down these barriers , some of that trade would also bypass Hong Kong .
`` Once China gets into the WTO , Taiwan would presumably get into the WTO soon as well , '' said Eden Woon , director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce .
`` That means that Taiwan would have to deal more directly with China . ''
With all the troubling implications , why did Woon and other Hong Kong officials push so energetically for the House to pass the bill ?
Part of the reason is political .
Beijing has made gaining entry into the trade organization the centerpiece of its economic agenda .
In Hong Kong , where politicians and business leaders try to outdo each other to be seen as loyal to the motherland , supporting the trade campaign was a natural .
Even Martin Lee , Hong Kong 's most prominent pro-democracy leader , traveled to Washington to lobby for the bill .
Lee , a longtime critic of Beijing , said his motives were political rather than economic .
`` I went to support the 1.2 billion people of China , not the Chinese government , '' Lee said .
`` I see in this bill a reasonable possibility that China will change its culture toward observing the rule of law . ''
Other supporters argue that Hong Kong can retain its middleman role -- with a few tweaks -- as a provider of services to the next generation of foreign companies that try to get into China .
Hong Kong , with its legions of lawyers , accountants and consultants , is quite likely to remain a valuable guide for those companies .
`` In order to handle all this trade , China will have to have a very well-developed service sector , '' said Victor K. Fung , the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the owner of a trading firm .
`` In the short run , it will be very difficult for China to ramp up those services . ''
But some more old-line Hong Kong industries will have to redefine themselves .
With the United States set to lift import quotas on Chinese textiles and textile products by 2005 , Woon predicted that many Hong Kong clothing makers would move their factories to the mainland to take advantage of lower production costs .
Hong Kong , he suggested , could recast itself as a center for Asian fashion design , rather than a manufacturing center .
China 's entry into the trade organization is also quite likely to deprive Hong Kong of its thriving gray market in goods like oil , cigarettes and agricultural products .
Those are smuggled from mainland China by the truckload and exported from Hong Kong so that they will be subject to lower tariffs .
Despite its expected negative effects on some Hong Kong industries , China 's trade campaign has made people here recognize that their economic fortunes are inextricably tied to the mainland .
It seemed no coincidence that last week Hong Kong announced a $ 12 billion expansion of its rail system , including a direct link between central Hong Kong and Shenzhen .
Hong Kong 's government estimates that China 's joining the WTO would add more than 5 percent to the territory 's gross domestic product over the next decade .
It also predicts that investment by Hong Kong companies in China will explode .
Local companies have already poured in a cumulative $ 156 billion .
Because Hong Kong and China would retain separate memberships in the World Trade Organization , officials said Hong Kong would not necessarily gain access to Chinese markets earlier than other countries .
But business people here are lobbying for special treatment .
Even without it , officials say , Hong Kong will flourish .
`` We do not mind if multinational companies go directly to China , '' the government 's chief spokesman , Stephen Lam , said .
`` As long as the pie gets bigger , even if we get a smaller piece , it will still be more than enough for us . ''
