As with populations and communities, the boundaries of ecosystems are usually not discrete. Ecosystems can range from a microcosm, such as the terrarium you see here, to lakes and forests. Many ecologists regard the entire biosphere as a global ecosystem, a composite of all the local ecosystems on Earth. The biosphere, or whole-earth ecosystem, is the most inclusive level in the hierarchy of biological organization (see</span><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.2</span><span class="Emphasis1">)</span>.</p><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The dynamics of an ecosystem involve two processes that cannot be fully described at lower organizational levels: energy flow and chemical cycling. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight. It is then converted to chemical energy by autotrophic organisms, passed to heterotrophs in the organic compounds of food, and dissipated in the form of heat. Chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen are cycled between abiotic and biotic components of the ecosystem. Photosynthetic organisms assimilate these elements in inorganic form from the air, soil, and water and incorporate them into organic molecules, some of which are consumed by animals. The elements are returned in inorganic form to the air, soil, and water by the metabolism of plants and animals and by other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, that break down organic wastes and dead organisms. The movements of energy and matter through ecosystems are related because both occur by the transfer of substances through photosynthesis and feeding relationships. However, because energy, unlike matter, cannot be recycled, an ecosystem must be powered by a continuous influx of new energy from an external source (the sun).
