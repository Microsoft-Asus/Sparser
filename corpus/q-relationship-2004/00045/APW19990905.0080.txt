MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Relations between Russia and the United States must not be damaged by allegations of money laundering by Russian organized crime through a New York bank , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in an interview Sunday .
Putin said Russian law enforcement was working with U.S. officials on the allegations that up to $ 10 billion was laundered through the Bank of New York , but gave no details .
He called for calm to avoid a deterioration in U.S. - Russian ties , already strained in recent months by the conflict in Kosovo and other international disputes .
The reputations of Russia and its businessmen were being unfairly tarnished , Putin said .
`` This campaign should not damage Russian - American relations and Russia 's business reputation , '' Putin said in an interview on ORT television .
`` Every Russian businessman should not be considered ... a Mafioso or connected with the mafia , '' he said in his first public reaction to the matter , which surfaced more than two weeks ago .
Illegal capital flight is a problem in Russia , but the claims about the Bank of New York case have been exaggerated and manipulated by politicians in both nations , Putin said in the interview .
The case has become an issue in early U.S. and Russian presidential election campaigning .
`` We will keep on working , try to solve the problem , but we should do it without dramatizing the situation , although we cannot ignore it , '' he said .
No one has been charged with a crime , and the Russian government has not been accused of any wrongdoing .
Some Russian officials have rejected the Bank of New York allegations as a Western attack designed to discredit and weaken Russia , but the government has shown little desire to discuss the matter .
Putin dismissed separate allegations that President Boris Yeltsin , his family and entourage received kickbacks from Mabetex , a Swiss company that won Kremlin construction contracts .
`` It is not likely , '' he said .
Russian officials have denied a report published last month by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra , which said that Mabetex deposited more than $ 1 million in a Swiss bank account .
The report said a top Kremlin aide allegedly made the money available to Yeltsin and his daughters , Tatyana Dyachenko and Yelena Okulova , through credit cards .
Mabetex chief executive Behgjet Pacolli has denied paying any bribes .
Meanwhile , former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said Sunday the government should consider filing charges if the Mabetex allegations are false .
`` If it 's a lie , it should be considered in court , '' Stepashin said in an interview with the television news program Itogi .
`` The rumor has appeared , and it undermines the stability of power . ''
