WASHINGTON --
A senior Pentagon adviser Thursday accused the Clinton administration of diminishing the Pentagon 's role in safeguarding sensitive American technology exports in favor of commercial interests .
`` What passes for an export control system has been hijacked by longtime ideological opponents of the very concept of export controls , '' said Peter Leitner , a senior trade adviser to the agency for 12 years .
While a senior Pentagon official denied Leitner 's charges made at a Senate hearing Thursday , he acknowledged the government could improve the way it handles exports of technology that have both commercial and military applications .
`` There is a balance , and we have to continue to make that balance , '' Franklin Miller , a principal deputy assistant secretary of defense told a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee .
Thursday 's hearing , a spinoff of the multipronged congressional inquiry into whether China obtained sensitive technology that helped its ballistic missiles , focused on an important , but little known Pentagon bureaucracy , the Defense Technology Security Administration .
The agency is responsible for preventing the unauthorized transfer of sensitive technical information and technology , such as communication satellites and supercomputers , to other countries .
Leitner , the hearing 's main witness , accused the administration of `` neutering '' the Pentagon agency 's role by hiring inexperienced and poorly trained staff , rubber-stamping export licenses on scant technical information and stifling dissent from career officials like himself .
But Miller took issue with virtually every one of Leitner 's criticisms .
Leitner , for example , had offered charts that indicated a sharp decline after 1995 in the percentage of cases of `` dual-use '' technology export cases that the agency had referred to the Defense Intelligence Agency and the armed services for review of sensitive technology .
But Miller said the decline coincided with a new policy that required the Commerce Department to refer all dual-use applications to the Pentagon agency for review , not just those that Commerce deemed necessary .
So the volume of cases rose .
After the hearing , Miller said the charge that the agency had been marginalized was `` nonsense , '' and then described fierce , internal administration debates over loosening exports controls on technology like satellites , as examples of full Pentagon participation .
But that defense did not persuade the committee chairman , Sen. Fred Thompson , R - Tenn. , who said , `` Commercial interests have had a bigger play than they should have . ''
Also on Capitol Hill , other congressional committees debated the merits of the administration 's China policies .
In a lift for President Clinton , the House Ways and Means Committee approved by voice vote Clinton 's decision to renew China 's trade status and urged lawmakers to reject calls to sever normal trading relations with Beijing .
The measure now goes to the full House .
In another House hearing , two major rocket motor makers testified that a policy started by President Ronald Reagan to allow American satellite companies to launch their satellites in foreign countries was hurting the American launching industry as well as helping foreign militaries .
`` A loss of satellite launching business to foreign competitors diminishes companies that support the U.S. strategic deterrent , while at the same time subsidizing the development of a foreign capability , '' Paul Ross , a group vice president of Alliant Techsystems , a rocket-motor maker in Hopkins , Minn. , told the House Science Committee .
At the same hearing , a former McDonnell Douglas aerospace engineer , Leon McKinney , confirmed what many scientists had been saying on Capitol Hill for weeks : `` If you improve launch-vehicle guidance technology . ''
The launch-vehicle technology guides rockets carrying satellites .
The underlying fear in any unauthorized technology transfer to the Chinese is that it helped improve the reliability of Beijing 's nuclear missiles .
The Clinton administration insists this has not been the result of any licensed technology exports .
`` Could American companies simply by asking questions in the right way upgrade Chinese capability ? '' asked Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R - Calif .
`` Most probably , '' said McKinney , who is now an independent aerospace consultant in Missouri .
