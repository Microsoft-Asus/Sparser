ANKARA , March 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkey has no intention to exclude Russia from Caspian oil projects , local newspaper Daily News Thursday quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying .
`` We reminded them -LRB- Russians -RRB- that it is out of the question for Turkey to exclude Russia from the Caspian Sea projects , '' said Sermet Atcanli , deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry .
Russian officials had expressed astonishment at the holding of the five-nation meeting in Turkish largest city Istanbul , which focused on the study of the Caspian oil exploitation , arguing all states around the Caspian Sea should take part in the meeting .
Foreign ministers and energy officials from Turkey , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan attended the meeting on March 1-2 .
Explaining why Russia was not included in the Istanbul meeting , Atcanli said that the gathering mainly focused on those countries that would sell oil and where the pipelines would pass through .
Russia will be invited to a more comprehensive meeting discussing the oil project , he said , without mentioning when and where the meeting will be held .
As an energy-starving country , Turkey has been playing an active role in exploiting the abundant Caspian oil in order to meet its rapidly increasing energy demands and also earn foreign exchange through the pipelines .
Azerbaijan and Georgia have expressed full support for the 1730-kilometer Baku -LRB- Azerbaijan -RRB- -Ceyhan -LRB- Turkey -RRB- route which passes through Azerbaijan , Georgia and Turkey .
The pipeline , which is estimated at a cost of 8 billion U.S. dollars , has an annual capacity of transporting 45 million tonnes of crude oil to international markets .
