Plants use light energy to build energy-rich organic molecules from water and CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and then use those organic molecules for fuel. In contrast, animals are heterotrophs and must obtain their chemical energy in food, which contains organic molecules synthesized by other organisms. Food is digested by enzymatic hydrolysis (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.2</span>), and energy-containing fuel molecules are absorbed by body cells. Once absorbed, fuel molecules have several possible fates. Most are used to generate ATP by the catabolic processes of cellular respiration and fermentation (see Chapter 9). The chemical energy of ATP powers cellular work, enabling cells, organs, and organ systems to perform the many functions that keep an animal alive. Since the production and use of ATP generates heat, an animal must continuously lose heat to its surroundings (heat balance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 44).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">After the energetic needs of staying alive are met, any remaining food molecules can be used in biosynthesis, including body growth and repair, synthesis of storage material such as fat, and production of reproductive structures, including gametes (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 40.10</span>). Biosynthesis requires both carbon skeletons for new structures and ATP to power their assembly. In some situations, biosynthetic products (such as body fat) can be broken down into fuel molecules for production of additional ATP, depending on the needs of the animal (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 9.19</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig40-10','../fig/big/fig40-10.jpg','fig40-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig40-10.jpg" alt="fig40-10" name="myfig40-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 40-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Bioenergetics of an animal: an overview.</span></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
