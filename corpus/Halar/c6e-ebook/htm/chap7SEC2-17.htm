(This would be a good time to review cell structure by returning to <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 7.7</span> and <span class="SmallCap">7.8</span> on pages 114 and 115.) But even as we dissect the cell, remember that none of its organelles works alone. As an example of cellular integration, consider the microscopic scene in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.31</span>. The large cell is a macrophage. It helps defend the body against infections by ingesting bacteria (the smaller yellow cells). The macrophage crawls along a surface and reaches out to the bacteria with thin pseudopodia ("filopodia"). Actin filaments interact with other elements of the cytoskeleton in these movements. After the macrophage engulfs the bacteria, they are destroyed by lysosomes. The elaborate endomembrane system, which includes the ER and the Golgi apparatus, produces the lysosomes. The digestive enzymes of the lysosomes and the proteins of the cytoskeleton are all made on ribosomes. And the synthesis of these proteins is programmed by genetic messages dispatched from the DNA in the nucleus. All these processes require energy, which mitochondria supply in the form of ATP. Cellular functions arise from cellular order: The cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-31','../fig/big/fig7-31.jpg','fig7-31');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-31.jpg" alt="fig7-31" name="myfig7-31"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-31.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The emergence of cellular functions from the cooperation of many organelles.</span> The ability of this macrophage (brown) to recognize, apprehend, and destroy bacteria (yellow) is a coordinated activity of the whole cell.
