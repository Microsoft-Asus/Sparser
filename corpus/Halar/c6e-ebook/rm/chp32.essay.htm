									<a name="para83"></a><p class="BlockText">Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts has suggested that observing an explosion of animal diversity in Cambrian strata is like viewing Earth from a satellite over a long period of time and noticing the emergence of cities only after they are large enough to be evident at that distance. What do you think Dr. Margulis was saying about the Cambrian "explosion"? How does this idea relate to the main point of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.14</span>?</p>

									<a name="para87"></a><p class="BlockText">The study of animal phylogeny is sometimes viewed as "science for science’s sake," and some organizations that fund scientific research tend to favor projects that have more obvious applications to human needs. On the other hand, general interest in the history of life seems to remain high, with articles on new discoveries frequently appearing in popular magazines. Suppose you have the opportunity to join a research team studying various aspects of the Cambrian explosion. Write a few paragraphs that could convince nonbiologists that this research is worth funding.</p>
