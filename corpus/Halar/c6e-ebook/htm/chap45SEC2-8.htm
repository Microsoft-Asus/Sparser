In many other vertebrates the two halves of the gland are separated on the two sides of the pharynx. The thyroid gland produces two very similar hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine: <span class="Emphasis2">triiodothyronine (T</span><SUB><span class="Emphasis2">3</span></SUB><span class="Emphasis2">),</span> which contains three iodine atoms, and tetraiodothyronine, or <span class="Emphasis2">thyroxine (T</span><SUB><span class="Emphasis2">4</span></SUB><span class="Emphasis2">),</span> which contains four iodine atoms (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.7</span>). In mammals, the thyroid secretes mainly T<SUB>4</SUB>, but target cells convert most of it to T<SUB>3</SUB>. T<SUB>3</SUB> has greater affinity for the hormone receptor, which is located in the cell nucleus. Thus it is mostly T<SUB>3</SUB> that brings about responses in target cells. The secretion of thyroid hormones is controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary in a complex negative feedback system (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.8</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig45-7','../fig/big/fig45-7.jpg','fig45-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig45-7.jpg" alt="fig45-7" name="myfig45-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 45-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Two thyroid hormones.</span> Structurally identical, except that T<SUB>3</SUB> has three iodine atoms and T<SUB>4</SUB> has four, these hormones regulate metabolism in most body cells.

When TSH binds to specific receptors in the thyroid gland, a signal-transduction pathway involving cAMP as a second messenger triggers the synthesis and release of the thyroid hormones T<SUB>3</SUB> and T<SUB>4</SUB>. The system is balanced by negative feedback loops. In the two main ones (red arrows), high levels of T<SUB>3</SUB>, T<SUB>4</SUB>, and TSH in the blood inhibit TRH secretion by the hypothalamus.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in vertebrate development and maturation. A striking example is the thyroid’s control of metamorphosis of a tadpole into a frog, which involves massive reorganization of many different tissues. The thyroid is equally important in human development. An inherited condition of thyroid deficiency known as cretinism results in markedly retarded skeletal growth and poor mental development. These defects can often be overcome, at least partially, if treatment with thyroid hormones is begun early in life. Studies with nonhuman animals have shown that thyroid hormones are required for the normal functioning of bone-forming cells and for the branching of nerve cells during embryonic development of the brain.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The thyroid gland also plays a vital role in homeostasis. In adult mammals, for instance, thyroid hormones help maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone, digestion, and reproductive functions. Throughout the body, T<SUB>3</SUB> and T<SUB>4</SUB> are important in bioenergetics, generally increasing the rate of oxygen consumption and cellular metabolism. Too much or too little of these hormones in the blood can result in serious metabolic disorders. For example, in humans, an excessive secretion of thyroid hormones, known as hyperthyroidism, produces such symptoms as high body temperature, profuse sweating, weight loss, irritability, and high blood pressure. The opposite condition, hypothyroidism, can cause cretinism in infants and produce symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, and intolerance to cold in adults.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Another condition associated with a shortage of thyroid hormones is an enlargement of the thyroid called goiter, often caused by a deficiency of iodine in the diet. The feedback system shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.8</span> explains why iodine deficiencies lead to goiter. In the absence of sufficient iodine, the thyroid gland cannot synthesize adequate amounts of T<SUB>3</SUB> and T<SUB>4</SUB>. Consequently, the pituitary continues to secrete TSH, leading to an enlargement of the thyroid.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">In addition to having cells that secrete T<SUB>3</SUB> and T<SUB>4</SUB>, the mammalian thyroid gland contains endocrine cells that secrete <span class="Emphasis2">calcitonin.</span> This hormone lowers calcium (Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>) levels in the blood as part of calcium homeostasis, described in the next section.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
