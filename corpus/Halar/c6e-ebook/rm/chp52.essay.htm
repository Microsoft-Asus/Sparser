									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">We estimate the size of a population of small mice in a particular field by the mark-recapture method. Our estimate is <span class="Emphasis1">N</span> = 350. Later, we learn from experiments on the behavior of these mice that they can locate a baited trap faster if they have already been rewarded with food by visiting that trap once before. Does this mean that our original estimate of 350 individuals was (a) too low or (b) too high? Explain your answer in terms of the equation for the mark-recapture method.</p>

									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">Many people regard the rapid population growth of developing countries as our most serious environmental problem. Others think that the population growth in developed countries, though smaller, is actually a greater threat to the environment. What kinds of problems result from population growth in (a) developing countries and (b) the industrialized world? Which do you think is the greater threat, and why?</p>
