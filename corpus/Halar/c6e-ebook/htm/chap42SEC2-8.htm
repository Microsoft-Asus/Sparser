There is also some leakage of blood proteins, even though the capillary wall is not very permeable to large molecules. The lost fluid and proteins return to the blood via the <span class="Emphasis2">lymphatic system.</span> Fluid enters this system by diffusing into tiny lymph capillaries intermingled among capillaries of the cardiovascular system. Once inside the lymphatic system, the fluid is called <span class="Emphasis2">lymph;</span> its composition is about the same as that of interstitial fluid. The lymphatic system drains into the circulatory system near the junction of the venae cavae with the right atrium (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.4</span>).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Lymph vessels, like veins, have valves that prevent the backflow of fluid toward the capillaries. Rhythmic contractions of the vessel walls help draw fluid into lymphatic capillaries. Also like veins, lymph vessels depend mainly on the movement of skeletal muscles to squeeze fluid toward the heart.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Along a lymph vessel are organs called <span class="Emphasis2">lymph nodes.</span> By filtering the lymph and attacking viruses and bacteria, lymph nodes play an important role in the body’s defense. Inside a lymph node is a honeycomb of connective tissue with spaces filled by white blood cells specialized for defense. When the body is fighting an infection, these cells multiply rapidly, and the lymph nodes become swollen and tender (which is why your doctor checks for swollen lymph nodes in your neck).</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The lymphatic system helps defend the body against infection and maintains the volume and protein concentration of the blood. You may also recall from Chapter 41 that the lymphatic system transports fats from the digestive tract to the circulatory system.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
