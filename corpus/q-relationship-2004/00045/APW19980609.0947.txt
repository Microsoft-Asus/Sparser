Police on Tuesday arrested 90 people across the country on drug-smuggling and arms-trafficking charges in what was believed to be a major blow to Albanian - Italian organized crime links .
The suspects included Albanian mob suspects who allegedly worked in connection with Mafia bosses from the Sicily and Calabria regions , the ANSA news agency said .
Those arrested included some Egyptian nationals who were mainly active in Milan in one of the biggest criminal rings in the whole Lombardy region .
Police also seized arms , reportedly headed to the embattled and mainly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia , and 113 kilos -LRB- 248 pounds -RRB- of cocaine and heroin .
The drugs were smuggled to Italy through Eastern Europe as well as through Greece across the Adriatic sea .
Police also issued arrest warrants for 25 fugitives .
Italian organized crime has long had links with the Balkan countries across the Adriatic .
Investigators say that Albanian gangs took advantage of the chaos at home last year to expand their operations in Italy .
