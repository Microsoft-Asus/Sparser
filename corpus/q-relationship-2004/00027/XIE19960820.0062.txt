LONDON , August 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A British man died from the strain of Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease -LRB- CJD -RRB- linked to BSE , or mad cow disease , after eating a `` contaminated beef product , '' a coroner ruled today .
The verdict , sure to arouse widespread controversy , is the first to legally link a human death to mad cow disease , according to BBC television .
Peter Hall , 20 , became a vegetarian in 1990 but previously had been very fond of beef , especially burgers .
Coroner Geoffrey Burt told an inquest in Durham , northeast England , that Peter Hall died last February of a new variant of CJD .
`` I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Peter contracted this disease prior to 1990 through eating some form of contaminated beef product , such as a beefburger , '' Burt said in his verdict .
In March , British government scientists said they had identified a new variant of CJD , and said it was likely people caught it from eating beef infected with BSE .
About a dozen cases of the new variant have been identified .
Burt said Hall was one of the victims .
The new variant of CJD affects people under the age of 40 , while the disease normally affects the elderly because of its long incubation period .
