MECHANISMS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

 

 Internal and external fertilization both depend on mechanisms ensuring that mature sperm encounter fertile eggs of the same species



 

 Species with internal fertilization usually produce fewer zygotes but provide more parental protection than species with external fertilization



 

 Complex reproductive systems have evolved in many animal phyla



The mechanisms of fertilization, the union of sperm and egg, play an important part in sexual reproduction. Some species have external fertilization; eggs are shed by the female and fertilized by the male in the environment (FIGURE 46.4). Other species have internal fertilization; sperm are deposited in or near the female reproductive tract, and fertilization occurs within the tract. (The cellular and molecular details of fertilization are discussed in Chapter 47.)

Fig 46-4. The release of eggs and external fertilization. Many amphibians shed gametes into the environment, and fertilization occurs outside the female's body. In most species, behavioral adaptations ensure that a male is present when the female releases eggs. Here, a female frog, clasped by a male (on top), has just released a mass of eggs. The male released sperm (not shown) at the same time, and external fertilization has already occurred in the surrounding water.
