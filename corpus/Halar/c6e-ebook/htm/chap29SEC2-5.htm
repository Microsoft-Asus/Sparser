There is no sporophyte generation, though these algae do retain and seem to nourish zygotes on the parental bodies, as do the gametophytes of land plants. The main difference is that the zygote of a charophycean undergoes <span class="Emphasis1">meiosis</span> to produce haploid spores, while the zygote of a plant undergoes <span class="Emphasis1">mitosis</span> to produce a multicellular sporophyte, which in turn produces haploid spores by meiosis. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis for the origin of plant sporophytes is that genetic change (mutations) in an ancestral charophycean caused a delay in meiosis until one or more mitotic divisions of the zygote had occurred (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.13</span>). The result would be a multicellular, diploid sporophyte. This would increase the number of cells that undergo meiosis and thus increase the number of spores produced per zygote. Some botanists speculate that such an evolutionary breakthrough was an important adaptation for maximizing the output of sexual reproduction from each zygote on land, where a shortage of water decreased the probability of swimming sperm fertilizing eggs.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-13','../fig/big/fig29-13.jpg','fig29-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-13.jpg" alt="fig29-13" name="myfig29-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A hypothetical mechanism for the origin of alternation of generations in the ancestor of plants.</span> Meiosis in a multicellular sporophyte, rather than direct meiosis by the zygote, would increase the number of haploid offspring (gametophytes) possible from each sexual union of sperm and ovum.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
