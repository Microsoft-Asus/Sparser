SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - An Iraqi girl who died on Jan. 17 in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, had bird flu, Iraq's health minister said on Monday, despite the World Health Organisation (WHO) having initially ruled out the virus.

The WHO said it was asking for further tests to be carried out in a laboratory in Britain and was sending a mission to Iraq to assess the situation.

"The test of Tijan's blood emphasised that she had bird flu from the kind that kills humans," Iraqi Health Minister Abdul Muttalib Mohammed Ali told a news briefing in Sulaimaniya, referring to 14-year-old Tijan Abdel-Qader.

The WHO said on Jan. 19 that the teenager, who died two days earlier, did not have bird flu. A WHO spokeswoman said at the weekend the statement had been based on tests carried out only in Iraq.

Iraqi officials have warned that rebel violence and anarchy that have impoverished Iraq, leaving its frontiers porous and sanitary regulations unenforceable, would make it very difficult for Baghdad to control any epidemic among wildfowl and poultry.

Bird flu is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia and can infect people who come into close contact with infected birds. It has killed at least 83 people since late 2003 and recently spread to Iraq's neighbour Turkey where local officials blame it for the death of four children.

Scientists say the H5N1 virus is mutating steadily and may eventually acquire the changes it needs to be easily transmitted from human to human. Because people lack any immunity to it, it could sweep the world in weeks or months, killing millions.
