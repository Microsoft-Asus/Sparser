CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla .
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Astronauts and cosmonauts may start moving into the international space station sooner than expected .
It 's the latest twist in a program that has dragged on for 15 years and is still bogged down in politics and economics .
Eager to move beyond the turmoil , NASA is considering launching the station 's first permanent crew as early as October , rather than in February 2000 as scheduled .
The pros , according to NASA : An early crew could handle any problems that crop up with the Russian -made living quarters , to be launched to the fledgling space station no earlier than September .
What 's more , an early crew would get Americans more interested and Russians more committed .
The cons : Because an early crew would leapfrog over shuttle supply flights , the station might not be ready to house all three men .
So one man might have to stay behind , at least until the next shuttle arrived with additional cargo .
Leaving the lone American behind is not an option , says NASA 's Gretchen McClain , deputy associate administrator for space station .
She 'd rather have the whole crew wait than bump William Shepherd , the station commander .
The problem is that Shepherd , 49 , a Navy captain and three-time shuttle flier , is not qualified to operate the Russian Soyuz capsule that will carry the first residents to the space station .
The two other crewmen , both Russian cosmonauts , are experienced Soyuz fliers .
So the debate over whether to launch the crew early -- and , if so , how many can go -- goes on .
The two space programs will discuss the matter next month in Moscow .
A decision likely wo n't be made , however , until much later .
`` As much as I 'd like to say we ought to go do it if we can , we need to make sure we 've asked all the right questions , '' McClain says .
`` We 'd have to have a real good story why we 'd go change our concept . ''
It might be more prudent , for instance , to launch the crew one month early instead of four , says McClain .
As usual , everything hinges on Russia 's still-incomplete crew quarters , a 43-foot cylinder that will double as a crucial control or so-called service module .
No one can move into the space station , and no other compartments can be attached , until the service module and its life-support systems are in place .
The compartment already is 1 1/2 years behind schedule because of inadequate Russian government funding .
It held up space station assembly for a full year ; the first two pieces did n't soar until November and December .
Russian space officials hope to ship the service module from Moscow to the launch site in Kazakstan in mid- April .
Months of testing will follow .
The Russian Space Agency is aiming for a late September launch of the module .
McClain calls that `` doable but aggressive . ''
The launch date , she says , will depend on how many problems pop up in testing .
`` The biggest issue continues to be the funding , '' she says .
And that funding , meager as it is , continues to be sapped by Mir .
Just last week , Russian space officials canceled at least two spacewalks by Mir cosmonauts -- not enough money , they explained .
If Russia cannot afford routine spacewalks , how can it afford to finish the service module and take part in the new space station , observers wonder .
`` There are many other pieces of hardware and services that Russia has promised to provide and , to the best of my knowledge , NASA does n't see much progress on any of those , '' says Marcia Smith , a specialist in space policy for the Congressional Research Service in Washington .
Staffing the international space station a few months early may be `` a good game plan to get the Russian government interested , '' Smith says .
But the idea loses its appeal , she says , if the United States has to pay for the Russian supply ships that would be needed ahead of schedule .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">To keep the service module progressing , NASA shelled out $ 60 million last year to the Russian Space Agency .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">NASA has $ 100 million available this year to assist the Russians , if necessary , but then that would be it , McClain says .</ENAMEX>
Smith questions such tactics .
`` If this is going to be a long-standing financial commitment on the part of the United States to keep sending money over there to buy this or buy that , I 'm not sure that 's a partnership , '' Smith says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Unless private investors can be found in the next month , Russian space officials say they will send the 13-year -old Mir crashing into the Pacific Ocean in August .</ENAMEX>
That would free up not only money but Soyuz spaceships and Progress supply ships for the international space station .
Staffing the international space station as soon as possible after Mir 's demise should ease the pain .
`` It helps them sell the concept of deorbiting the Mir , '' McClain says .
What 's more , McClain says , the sooner the international space station is occupied , the sooner `` the general public will start really understanding what it is that we 're doing with the space station and become a little bit more interested . ''
Smith doubts the interest will last long .
`` It will be very good publicity for a couple of weeks , '' she says , `` and then it will fade just like Skylab faded and just like Mir has faded . ''
