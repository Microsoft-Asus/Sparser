MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The Central Bank halted dollar sales for the second straight day Thursday in an effort to save its dwindling hard currency reserves .
The Central Bank has kept the official exchange rate unchanged at 7.86 rubles a dollar , or 12.7 cents per ruble , since Tuesday .
It said it was forced to stop selling dollars because it needed to save its hard currency reserves for key imports and other urgent needs , rather than spending them in attempts to prop up the weak ruble .
The Moscow interbank currency exchange opened Thursday with the ruble quoted at 8.2-9.5 against the dollar , or 12.1-10.5 cents per ruble , and the demand for dollars at nearly dlrs 300 million .
There were virtually no offers to sell dollars and the trading was suspended `` for some time , '' according to the Central Bank .
Analysts say that currency controls , which would amount to taking the ruble off the open market , are now almost inevitable .
But officials have denied such plans , and said the suspension of trading is temporary .
Acting deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said on Thursday that the market should determine the ruble 's real value , which he said now could be around 9.5 rubles a dollar .
However , Alexander Shokhin , the head of the pro-government Our Home Is Russia parliament faction close to acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin , said Thursday that the government may consider suspending the ruble 's convertibility and instituting price controls to cope with the crisis .
Shokhin , who is considered the main candidate for the post of the Central Bank chairman to replace current chief Sergei Dubinin , also said that some major commercial banks may be nationalized .
`` Now we ca n't rely on liberal monetary approaches , '' he said at a news conference .
The financial crisis has so far had little effect on ordinary Russians , who do n't own stocks or bonds or mutual funds .
The anxiety some are beginning to feel comes largely from fear of inflation , which many expect to rise in the wake of the government 's decision to devalue the ruble .
`` Prices on most things have n't risen much yet , but we are buying more just in case , '' said 51-year -old Galina Filatova , who runs a small candy shop .
`` Before , I might have bought one package of sugar , but now I 'm buying three at a time . ''
The interbank currency market has remained paralyzed as Russian commercial banks fear doing business with each other , trying to get rid of their increasingly worthless ruble assets .
The Central Bank announced Thursday that its hard currency reserves as of last Friday stood at dlrs 13.4 billion , down dlrs 1.7 billion in the week since Aug. 14 .
Overall since July , the Central Bank has pumped dlrs 8.8 billion into the Russian economy .
In street trading , the ruble fell below 10 rubles a dollar but it was difficult to buy any significant amount of hard currency amid the run on the national currency .
Russian stocks continued their steep dive in thin trading .
By early afternoon , the Russian Trading System index had dropped to 69.29 points , down 9.15 percent from its close Wednesday at 76.26 points .
The trading volume was dlrs 4 million , still less than Wednesday 's volume -- the lowest in the market 's history -- of dlrs 4.6 million .
Communists and other hardliners dominating the Russian parliament urged the government on Thursday to pump more cash into the economy and provide social guarantees to state workers .
Critics warned that the increase in money supply could again trigger the hyperinflation that plagued Russia at the start of its market reforms .
Chernomyrdin said Thursday that his urgent talks Wednesday night with International Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus did not address new IMF credits to Russia , Russian news reports said .
Camdessus reportedly assured Chernomyrdin that the Fund would support Russia .
Media reports said that the Russian government was desperately trying to persuade the IMF and other Western lending organizations to deliver the whole dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package intended for this and next year as soon as possible .
