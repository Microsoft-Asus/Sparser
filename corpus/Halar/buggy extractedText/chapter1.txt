REVIEW: USING THEMES TO CONNECT THE CONCEPTS OF BIOLOGY

   

Biology, the study of life, is rooted in the human spirit. People keep pets, nurture houseplants, invite avian visitors with backyard birdhouses, and visit zoos and nature preserves. Biology is the scientific extension of this human tendency to feel connected to and curious about all forms of life. It is a science for adventurous minds. It takes us, personally or vicariously, into jungles, deserts, seas, and other environments, where a variety of living forms and their physical surroundings are interwoven into complex webs called ecosystems. Studying life leads us into laboratories to examine more closely how living things, called organisms, work. Biology draws us into the microscopic world of the fundamental units of life known as cells and into the submicroscopic realm of the molecules that make up those cells. Our intellectual journey also takes us back in time, for biology encompasses not only contemporary life, but also a history of ancestral forms stretching nearly 4 billion years into the past. The scope of biology is immense. The purpose of this book is to introduce you to this multifaceted science.

You are becoming involved with biology during its most exciting era. The largest and best-equipped community of scientists in history is beginning to solve biological puzzles that once seemed unsolvable. We are moving ever closer to understanding how a single cell becomes a plant or animal; how the human mind works; how plants convert solar energy to the chemical energy of food; how organisms network in biological communities such as forests and coral reefs; and how the great diversity of life on Earth evolved from the first microbes.

Modern biology is as important as it is inspiring. Genetics and cell biology are revolutionizing medicine and agriculture. Molecular biology is providing new tools for anthropology, helping us trace the origin and dispersal of early humans. Ecology is helping us evaluate environmental issues, such as the causes and consequences of global warming. Neuroscience and evolutionary biology are reshaping psychology and sociology. These are just a few examples of how biology is weaving into the fabric of our culture as never before.

These are also the most challenging times to learn biology. The same discovery explosion that makes modern biology so exhilarating can also be intimidating, even to professional biologists. How, then, can beginning biology students hope to keep their heads above water in this deluge of data and discovery? The key is to recognize unifying themes that pervade all of biology--themes that will still apply decades from now, when much of the specific information presented in any textbook will be obsolete. This chapter introduces some broad, enduring themes in the study of life. The bulleted list on this page previews these ten themes.

EVOLUTION, UNITY, AND DIVERSITY

 

 Diversity and unity are the dual faces of life on Earth



 

 Evolution is the core theme of biology



We can think of biology's enormous scope as having two dimensions. The "vertical" dimension is the size scale that reaches all the way from molecules to the biosphere, as you learned in the preceding section. But there is also a "horizontal" dimension stretching across the great diversity of life, now and throughout life's history. Evolution is the key to understanding this biological diversity. Evolutionary change has been a central feature of life since it arose about 4 billion years ago. The evolutionary connections among all organisms explain the unity and diversity of life. This section introduces two related themes that will help you see these evolutionary connections throughout your study of life.





THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE

 

 Science is a process of inquiry that includes repeatable observations and testable hypotheses



 

 Science and technology are functions of society



Darwin helped develop biology as a science by seeking natural rather than supernatural causes for the unity and diversity of life. But what is science? And how do we tell the difference between science and other ways we try to make sense of nature?





REVIEW: USING THEMES TO CONNECT THE CONCEPTS OF BIOLOGY

In some ways, biology is the most demanding of all sciences, partly because living systems are so complex and partly because biology is a multidisciplinary science that requires a knowledge of chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Modern biology is the decathlon of natural science. And of all the sciences, biology is the most connected to the humanities and social sciences. If you are a biology major or a preprofessional student, you have an opportunity to become a versatile scientist. If you are a physical science major or an engineering student, you will discover in the study of life many applications for what you have learned in your other science courses. If you are a nonscience student enrolled in biology as part of a liberal arts education, you have selected a course in which you can sample many scientific disciplines.

No matter what brings you to biology, you will find the study of life to be challenging and uplifting. Do not let the details of biology spoil a good time. The complexity of life is inspiring, but it can be overwhelming. To help you from "getting lost in the forest because of all the trees," each chapter of this book is constructed from a manageable number of key concepts. The concepts are listed at the beginning of the chapter, are displayed throughout the chapter, and then reappear in the summary at the end of the chapter. The details of a chapter enrich your understanding of the concepts and how they fit together. This introductory chapter is the exception; instead of presenting the key concepts of a particular area of biology, this chapter has introduced themes that cut across all biological fields--ways of thinking about biology (TABLE 1.1). These ten themes, along with the key concepts in each chapter, will provide you with a framework for fitting together the many things you will learn in your multidisciplinary exploration of life--and will encourage you to begin asking important questions of your own.

 Each level of biological organization has emergent properties

A basic characteristic of life is a high degree of order. You can see it in the intricate pattern of veins throughout a leaf or in the colorful pattern of a bird's feathers. Biological order exists at all levels, even those invisible to the unaided eye.

A Hierarchy of Organization

Biological organization is based on a hierarchy of structural levels, each level building on the levels below it (FIGURE 1.2). Starting at the lowest level, atoms, the chemical building blocks of all matter, are ordered into complex biological molecules. Many of the molecules of life are arranged into minute structures called organelles, which are in turn the components of cells.

Fig 1-2. The hierarchy of biological organization. This sequence of images takes us all the way from atoms to a biological community of many interacting species.

Cells are subunits of organisms, and organisms are the units of life. Some organisms, such as amoebas, consist of single cells, but others are multicellular aggregates of many specialized types of cells. What an amoeba accomplishes with a single cell--the uptake and processing of nutrients, excretion of wastes, response to environmental stimuli, reproduction, and other functions--a human or other multicellular organism accomplishes with a division of labor among specialized cells. Unlike the amoeba, none of your cells could live for long on its own. The organism we recognize as an animal or plant is not a random collection of individual cells, but a multi cellular cooperative.

Multicellular organisms exhibit three major structural levels above the cell: Similar cells are grouped into tissues; specific arrangements of different tissues form organs; and organs are grouped into organ systems. For example, the signals (nerve impulses) that coordinate your movements are transmitted along specialized cells called neurons. The nervous tissue within your brain has billions of neurons organized into a communications network of spectacular complexity. The brain, however, is not pure nervous tissue; it is an organ built of many different tissues, including a type called connective tissue that forms the protective covering of the brain. The brain is itself part of the nervous system, which also includes the spinal cord and the many nerves that transmit messages between the spinal cord and other parts of the body. The nervous system is only one of several organ systems characteristic of humans and other complex animals.

In the hierarchy of biological organization, there are tiers beyond the individual organism. A population is a localized group of organisms belonging to the same species; populations of different species living in the same area make up a biological community; and community interactions that include nonliving features of the environment, such as soil and water, form an ecosystem.

Investigating biological organization at its many levels is fundamental to the study of life. This text essentially follows such an organization, beginning with the chemistry of life and ending with the study of ecosystems and the biosphere, the sum of all Earth's ecosystems. However, we will also see that biological processes often involve several levels of biological organization. For example, when a rattlesnake explodes from its coiled posture and strikes a mouse, the snake's coordinated movements result from complex interactions at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels within its body. This behavior also affects the biological community in which the snake and its prey live. Such episodes of predation can have an important cumulative impact on the sizes of both the mouse and the rattlesnake populations. Most biologists specialize in the study of life at a particular level, but they gain broader perspective when they integrate their discoveries with processes occurring at lower and higher levels.

Emergent Properties

With each step upward in the hierarchy of biological order, novel properties emerge that were not present at the simpler levels of organization. These emergent properties result from interactions between components. A molecule such as a protein has attributes not exhibited by any of its component atoms, and a cell is certainly much more than a bag of molecules. If the intricate organization of the human brain is disrupted by a head injury, that organ will cease to function properly, even though all its parts may still be present. And an organism is a living whole greater than the sum of its parts.

This theme of emergent properties accents the importance of structural arrangement and applies to inanimate material as well as to life. By itself, neither the head nor the handle of a hammer is very useful for driving nails; but put these parts together in a certain way, and the functional properties of a hammer emerge. Diamonds and graphite are both made of carbon, but they have different properties because their carbon atoms are arranged differently. The emergent properties of life are not supernatural, but simply reflect a hierarchy of structural organization without counterpart among inanimate objects.

Life resists a simple, one-sentence definition because it is associated with numerous emergent properties. Yet almost any child perceives that a dog or a bug or a tree is alive and a rock is not. We recognize life by what living things do. FIGURE 1.3 illustrates and describes some of the properties and processes we associate with the state of being alive.

Fig 1-3. Some properties of life.

Reductionism in Biology

Because the properties of life emerge from complex organization, scientists seeking to understand biological processes confront a dilemma. One horn of the dilemma is that we cannot fully explain a higher level of order by breaking it down into its parts. A dissected animal no longer functions; a cell reduced to its chemical ingredients is no longer a cell. Disrupting a living system interferes with the meaningful explanation of its processes. The other horn of the dilemma is the futility of trying to analyze something as complex as an organism or a cell without taking it apart. Reductionism--reducing complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study--is a powerful strategy in biology. For example, by studying the molecular structure of a substance called DNA that had been extracted from cells, James Watson and Francis Crick deduced, in 1953, how this molecule could serve as the chemical basis of inheritance. The central role of DNA was better understood, however, when it was possible to study its interactions with other substances in the cell. Biology balances the reductionist strategy with the longer-range objective of understanding emergent properties--how the parts of cells, organisms, and higher levels of order, such as ecosystems, are functionally integrated.





 Cells are an organism's basic units of structure and function

The cell is the lowest level of structure capable of performing all the activities of life. All organisms are composed of cells, the basic units of structure and function (see FIGURE 1.2).

The Cell Theory

Robert Hooke, an English scientist, first described and named cells in 1665, when he observed a slice of cork (bark from an oak tree) with a microscope that magnified 30 times (30&#160;X&#160;). Apparently believing that the tiny boxes, or "cells," that he saw were unique to cork, Hooke never realized the significance of his discovery. His contemporary, a Dutchman named Anton van Leeuwenhoek, discovered organisms we now know to be single-celled. Using grains of sand that he had polished into magnifying glasses as powerful as 300&#160;X&#160;, Leeuwenhoek discovered a microbial world in droplets of pond water and also observed the blood cells and sperm cells of animals. In 1839, nearly two centuries after the discoveries of Hooke and Leeuwenhoek, cells were finally acknowledged as the universal units of life by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, two German biologists. In a classic case of inductive reasoning--reaching a generalization based on many concurring observations--Schleiden and Schwann summarized their own microscopic studies and those of others by concluding that all living things consist of cells. This generalization forms the basis of what is known as the cell theory. This theory was later expanded to include the idea that all cells come from other cells. The ability of cells to divide to form new cells is the basis for all reproduction and for the growth and repair of multicellular organisms, including humans.

The Two Main Cell Types

All cells are enclosed by a membrane that regulates the passage of materials between the cell and its surroundings. And every cell, at some stage in its life, contains DNA, the heritable material that directs the cell's many activities.

Two major kinds of cells--prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells--can be distinguished by their structural organization. The cells of the microorganisms called bacteria and archaea are prokaryotic. All other forms of life are composed of eukaryotic cells. Much more complex than the prokaryotic cell, the eukaryotic cell is subdivided by internal membranes into many different functional compartments--membrane-enclosed organelles (FIGURE 1.4). In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is organized along with certain proteins into structures called chromosomes contained within a nucleus, the largest organelle of most eukaryotic cells. Surrounding the nucleus is the cytoplasm, consisting of a thick fluid (cytosol) in which are suspended the various organelles that perform most of the cell's functions. Some eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, have tough walls external to their membranes. Animal cells lack walls.

Fig 1-4. Structural organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cell, found in plants, animals, and all other organisms except bacteria and archaea, is characterized by an extensive subdivision into many different functional compartments called organelles. The prokaryotic cell, unique to bacteria and archaea, is much simpler, lacking most of the organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Most prokaryotic cells are also much smaller than eukaryotic cells.

In the much simpler prokaryotic cell, the DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell in a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells also lack the cytoplasmic organelles typical of eukaryotic cells. Almost all prokaryotic cells have tough external cell walls.

Although prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells contrast sharply in complexity, we will see that they have some key similarities. Cells vary widely in size, shape, and specific structural features, but all are highly ordered structures that carry out complicated processes necessary for maintaining life.





 The continuity of life is based on heritable information in the form of DNA

Order implies information; instructions are required to arrange parts or processes in an organized way. Biological instructions are encoded in the molecule known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA is the substance of genes, the units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to offspring (FIGURE 1.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 1-5. The genetic material: DNA. DNA molecules carry biological information from one generation to the next.

Each DNA molecule is made up of two long chains arranged into what is called a double helix. Each chain is composed of four kinds of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. The way DNA conveys information is analogous to the way we arrange the letters of the alphabet into precise sequences with specific meanings. The word rat, for example, conjures up an image of a rodent; tar and art, which contain the same letters, mean quite different things. Libraries are filled with books containing information encoded in varying sequences of only 26 letters. We can think of nucleotides as the alphabet of inheritance. Specific sequential arrangements of these four chemical letters encode the precise information in a gene, which is typically hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long.

All forms of life employ essentially the same genetic code. A particular sequence of nucleotides says the same thing to one organism as it does to another; differences between organisms reflect differences between their nucleotide sequences. The diverse forms of life are different expressions of a common language for programming biological order.

Inheritance itself depends on a mechanism for copying DNA and passing its sequence of chemical letters on to offspring. As a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, it copies its DNA. A mechanical system that moves chromosomes then distributes the DNA copies equally to the two "daughter" cells. In species that reproduce sexually, offspring inherit copies of DNA from the parents' sperm and egg cells. The continuity of life over the generations and over the eons has its molecular basis in the replication of DNA.

The entire "library" of genetic instructions that an organism inherits is called its genome. The nucleus of each human cell packs a genome that is 3 billion chemical letters long. If this sequence of nucleotides were written in letters the size of those you are now reading, the information would fill more than a hundred books the size of this one. In 2001, scientists tabulating the sequence of these letters published a "rough draft" of the human genome. The press and world leaders acclaimed this international achievement as the greatest scientific triumph ever. But unlike past cultural zeniths, such as the landing of Apollo astronauts on the moon, the sequencing of the human genome is more a commencement than a climax. As the quest continues, biologists will learn the functions of thousands of genes and how their activities are coordinated in the development of an organism. It is a striking example of human curiosity about life at its many levels.





 Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization

Given a choice of tools, you would not loosen a screw with a hammer or pound a nail with a screwdriver. How a device works is correlated with its structure: Form fits function. Applied to biology, this theme is a guide to the anatomy of life at its many structural levels, from molecules to organisms. Analyzing a biological structure gives us clues about what it does and how it works. Conversely, knowing the function of a structure provides insight about its construction.

An example of this structure-function theme is the aerodynamically efficient shape of a bird's wing (FIGURE 1.6). The skeleton of the bird also has structural qualities that contribute to flight, with bones that have a strong but light honeycombed internal structure. The flight muscles of a bird are controlled by neurons (nerve cells), which transmit impulses. With their long extensions, neurons are especially well structured for communication. The flight muscles need plenty of energy, which they obtain from organelles called mitochondria. These organelles are the sites of cellular respiration, the chemical process that powers the cell by using oxygen to help tap the energy stored in sugar and other food molecules. A mitochondrion has an inner membrane with many infoldings. Molecules embedded in the inner membrane carry out many of the steps in cellular respiration, and the infoldings pack a large amount of this membrane into a minute container (see FIGURE 1.6d). In exploring life on its different structural levels, we discover functional beauty at every turn.

 Organisms are open systems that interact continuously with their environments

Life does not exist in a vacuum. An organism is an example of what scientists call an open system, an entity that exchanges materials and energy with its surroundings. Each organism interacts continuously with its environment, which includes other organisms as well as nonliving factors. The roots of a tree, for example, absorb water and minerals from the soil, and the leaves take in carbon dioxide from the air. Solar energy absorbed by chlorophyll, the green pigment of leaves, drives photosynthesis, which converts water and carbon dioxide to sugar and oxygen. The tree releases oxygen to the air, and its roots change the soil by breaking up rocks into smaller particles, secreting acid, and absorbing minerals. Both organism and environment are affected by the interaction between them. The tree also interacts with other life, including soil microorganisms associated with its roots and animals that eat its leaves and fruit.

Ecosystem Dynamics

The many interactions between organisms and their environment are interwoven to form the fabric of an ecosystem. The dynamics of any ecosystem include two major processes. One is the cycling of nutrients. For example, minerals acquired by plants will eventually be returned to the soil by microorganisms that decompose leaf litter, dead roots, and other organic debris. The second major process in an ecosystem is the flow of energy from sunlight to photosynthetic life (producers) to organisms that feed on plants (consumers) (FIGURE 1.7).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 1-7. An introduction to energy flow and energy transformation in an ecosystem. Living is work, and work requires that organisms obtain and use energy. Most ecosystems are solar powered. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert light energy to the chemical energy stored in sugar and other complex molecules. By breaking these fuel molecules down to simpler molecules, organisms can harvest the stored energy and put it to work. Animals and other consumers acquire their energy in chemical form by eating plants, by eating animals that ate plants, or by decomposing organic refuse, such as leaf litter and dead animals. The energy that enters an ecosystem in the form of sunlight exits in the form of heat, which all organisms dissipate to their surroundings.

Energy Conversion

The exchange of energy between an organism and its surroundings involves the transformation of one form of energy to another. For example, when a leaf produces sugar, it converts solar energy to chemical energy in sugar molecules. When an animal's muscle cells use sugar as fuel to power movements, they convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. All of the work of cells involves the transformation of chemical energy (which is ordered) into heat, which is the unordered energy of random molecular motion. Life requires the continual uptake of ordered energy and the release of some unordered energy to the surroundings.





 Regulatory mechanisms ensure a dynamic balance in living systems

If you strike a match, it undergoes a chemical reaction in which the chemical energy in its molecules is transformed into heat and light. Burning is unregulated energy transformation, obviously not a suitable way for living cells to transform energy. Organisms are able to obtain useful energy from fuel molecules such as sugar because cells break the molecules down in a series of closely regulated chemical reactions.

Regulation of the chemical reactions within cells centers on protein molecules called enzymes. Produced by the cells in which they function, enzymes are catalysts, substances that speed up chemical reactions. When your muscle cells need a lot of energy during exercise, enzymes catalyze the rapid breakdown of sugar (glucose) molecules, releasing energy that can be put to work. In contrast, when you rest, other enzymes catalyze the chemical conversion of glucose to storage substances that may be added to the body's fuel reserves. With one group of enzymes catalyzing the breakdown of glucose and another group catalyzing its formation, how is order maintained in the cell? A big part of the answer is that regulatory mechanisms determine precisely when, where, and how fast certain reactions occur in a cell.

Many biological processes are self-regulating, operating by a mechanism called feedback, in which an output or product of a process regulates that process. Negative feedback, also called feedback inhibition, slows or stops processes; positive feedback speeds a process up (FIGURE 1.8).

Fig 1-8. Regulation by feedback mechanisms.

Mammals and birds have a negative-feedback system that keeps body temperature within a narrow range, despite wide fluctuations in the animal's surroundings. A "thermostat" in the brain controls processes that hold the temperature of the blood close to a set point (about 37&#176;C in mammals). For instance, when the human body starts getting hot, signals from the brain's control center increase the activity of sweat glands and the diameter of blood vessels in the skin. Evaporative cooling results as sweating increases, and heat radiates from the blood vessels as they fill with warm blood. Negative feedback occurs as soon as the blood cools back to the set point, causing the control center to stop sending signals to the skin. If the blood temperature drops below the set point, the brain's control center inactivates the sweat glands and constricts the skin's blood vessels. This shunts blood to deeper tissues, reducing heat loss. When the blood warms back to the set point, negative feedback occurs again, and signals from the control center cease. This type of steady-state regulation, which keeps an internal factor such as body temperature within narrow tolerance limits, is called homeostasis (see FIGURE 1.3f).

The clotting of blood is an example of positive feedback. When a blood vessel is injured, structures in the blood called platelets start accumulating at the site. Positive feedback occurs as chemicals released by the platelets attract more platelets, and the platelet cluster initiates a complex sequence of chemical reactions that seals the wound with a clot.

Regulation by positive and negative feedback is a pervasive theme in biology, and we will see numerous examples throughout this text.





 Diversity and unity are the dual faces of life on Earth

Diversity is a hallmark of life. Biologists have identified and named about 1.5 million species, including over 280,000 plants, almost 50,000 vertebrates (animals with backbones), and more than 750,000 insects. Thousands of newly identified species are added to the list each year. Estimates of the total diversity of life range from about 5 million to over 30 million species.

Grouping Species: The Basic Concept

Biological diversity is something to relish and preserve, but it can also be a bit overwhelming (FIGURE 1.9). Confronted with complexity, humans are inclined to categorize diverse items into a smaller number of groups. Grouping species that are similar is natural for us. We may speak of squirrels and butterflies, though we recognize that many different species belong to each group. We may even sort groups into broader categories, such as rodents (which include squirrels) and insects (which include butterflies). Taxonomy, the branch of biology that names and classifies species, formalizes this hierarchical ordering (FIGURE 1.10). You will learn more about this taxonomic scheme in Chapter 25. For now, we focus on kingdoms and domains, the broadest units of classification.

Fig 1-9. A small sample of biological diversity. Shown here are just some of the tens of thousands of species in the butterfly and moth collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. As diverse as the species are, they are all variations on a common anatomical theme. One of biology's major goals is to explain how such diversity arises while also accounting for characteristics common to different species.

Fig 1-10. Classifying life. The taxonomic scheme classifies species into groups nested within more comprehensive groups. Species that are very closely related are placed in the same genus, genera are grouped into families, and so on, each level of classification being more comprehensive than those it includes. This example classifies the species Canis lupus, the wolf.

The Three Domains of Life

Until the past decade, most biologists divided the diversity of life into five main groups, or kingdoms. (The most familiar two are the plant and animal kingdoms.) But new methods, such as comparisons of DNA among organisms, have led to an ongoing reassessment of the number and boundaries of kingdoms. Various classification schemes are now based on six, eight, or more kingdoms. But as the debate continues on the kingdom level, there is broader consensus that the kingdoms of life can now be assigned to three even higher levels of classification called domains.

The three domains are named Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (FIGURE 1.11). The first two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, recognize two very different groups of organisms that both have prokaryotic cells. In the five-kingdom system, these prokaryotes were combined in a single kingdom. But newer evidence suggests that the organisms known as archaea may be more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to bacteria.

Fig 1-11. Three domains of life. The domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya represent three fundamentally different kinds of organisms. The domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of organisms, mostly unicellular, with prokaryotic cells (see FIGURE 1.4). The more traditional five-kingdom system of classification recognized all prokaryotes as members of one kingdom, Monera, plus the four kingdoms in the domain Eukarya (organisms with eukaryotic cells) shown here.

All the eukaryotes (organisms with eukaryotic cells) are grouped into at least four kingdoms in the domain Eukarya. Kingdom Protista consists of eukaryotic organisms that are generally single-celled--for example, the microscopic protozoans, such as the amoebas. Many biologists extend the boundaries of the kingdom Protista to include certain multicellular forms, such as seaweeds, that seem to be closely related to the unicellular protists. Other biologists split the protists into multiple kingdoms. The remaining three eukaryotic kingdoms--Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia--consist of multicellular eukaryotes. These three kingdoms are distinguished partly by their modes of nutrition. Plants produce their own sugars and other foods by photosynthesis. Fungi are mostly decomposers that absorb nutrients by breaking down dead organisms and organic wastes, such as leaf litter and animal feces. Animals obtain food by ingestion, which is the eating and digesting of other organisms. It is, of course, the kingdom to which we belong.

Unity in the Diversity of Life

If life is so diverse, how can biology have any unifying themes at all? What, for instance, can a tree, a mushroom, and a human possibly have in common? As it turns out, a great deal! Underlying the diversity of life is a striking unity, especially at the lower levels of biological organization. We have already seen one example: the universal genetic language of DNA. That ubiquitous feature connects all kingdoms of life, even uniting prokaryotes such as bacteria with eukaryotes such as humans. And among eukaryotes, unity is evident in many of the details of cell structure (FIGURE 1.12). Above the cellular level, however, organisms are so variously adapted to their ways of life that describing and classifying biological diversity remains an important goal of biology. It is the process called evolution that accounts for this combination of unity and diversity in life.

Fig 1-12. An example of unity underlying the diversity of life: the architecture of eukaryotic cilia. Eukaryotic organisms as diverse as the single-celled Paramecium and animals possess cilia, locomotor "hairs" that extend from cells. Comparing cross sections of cilia from diverse eukaryotes reveals a common structural organization. Such striking similarity in complex components contributes to the evidence that organisms as different as Paramecium and humans are, to some degree, related.





 Evolution is the core theme of biology

The history of life, as documented by fossils and other evidence, is a saga of a restless Earth billions of years old, inhabited by a changing cast of living forms (FIGURE 1.13). Life evolves. Just as an individual has a family history, each species is one twig of a branching tree of life extending back in time through ancestral species more and more remote. Species that are very similar, such as the brown bear and the polar bear, share a common ancestor that represents a relatively recent branch point on the tree of life. But through an ancestor that lived much farther back in time, all bears are also related to squirrels, humans, and all other mammals. Hair and milk-producing mammary glands are just two of a long list of uniquely mammalian traits. It is what we would expect if all mammals descended from a common ancestor, a prototypical mammal. And mammals, birds, reptiles, and all other vertebrates share a common ancestor even more ancient. Evidence of a still broader relationship can be found in such similarities as the matching machinery of all eukaryotic cilia (see FIGURE 1.12). Trace life back far enough, and there are only fossils of the primeval prokaryotes that inhabited Earth over 3.5 billion years ago. We can recognize some of their vestiges in our own cells--in the universal genetic code, for example. All of life is connected. And the basis for this kinship is evolution, the process that has transformed life on Earth from its earliest beginnings to the extensive diversity we see today. Evolution is the one theme that ties together all others and unifies biology.

Darwin and Natural Selection

Charles Darwin (FIGURE 1.14) brought biology into focus in 1859 when he published The Origin of Species. Darwin's book presented two main concepts. First, Darwin argued convincingly from several lines of evidence that contemporary species arose from a succession of ancestors through a process of "descent with modification," his phrase for evolution. (The evidence for evolution is discussed in detail in Chapter 22.) Darwin's second concept in The Origin of Species was his theory for how life evolves. This proposed mechanism of evolution is called natural selection.

The author of numerous books and monographs on topics as diverse as barnacles, plant movements, and island geology, Darwin would be remembered as one of the greatest naturalists of the 19th century even if he had never published on the topic of evolution. But it was The Origin of Species that established Darwin's place as the most influential scientist in the development of modern biology. He is buried next to Isaac Newton in London's Westminster Abbey.

Darwin synthesized the concept of natural selection from observations that by themselves were neither new nor profound. Others had the pieces of the puzzle, but Darwin saw how they fit together. He inferred natural selection by connecting two observations:

OBSERVATION #1: Individual variation. Individuals in a population of any species vary in many heritable traits.

OBSERVATION #2: Struggle for existence. Any population of a species has the potential to produce far more offspring than the environment can possibly support with food, space, and other resources. This overproduction makes a struggle for existence among the variant members of a population inevitable.

INFERENCE: Differential reproductive success. Those individuals with traits best suited to the local environment generally leave a disproportionately large number of surviving, fertile offspring. This differential reproductive success of some individuals over others means that certain heritable traits (those carried by the best-suited individuals) are more likely to appear in each new generation. Darwin called differential reproductive success natural selection, and he envisioned it as the cause of evolution (FIGURE 1.15, p. 14).

We see the products of natural selection in the exquisite adaptations of organisms to the special problems posed by their environments (FIGURE 1.16, p. 14). Notice, however, that natural selection does not create adaptations; rather, it screens the heritable variations in each generation, increasing the frequencies of some variations and decreasing the frequencies of others over the generations. Natural selection is an editing process, with heritable variations exposed to environmental factors that favor the reproductive success of some individuals over others. The camouflage of the sea horse in FIGURE 1.16 did not result from individuals changing during their lifetimes to look more like their backgrounds and then passing that improvement on to offspring. The adaptation evolved over many generations by the greater reproductive success in each generation of individuals that were innately better camouflaged than the average member of the sea horse population.

Fig 1-16. Evolutionary adaptation is a product of natural selection. This sea horse lives among kelp (seaweed). The fish looks so much like a seaweed that it lures prey into the seeming safety of the kelp forest and then eats them. The camouflage also helps prevent the sea horse itself from becoming prey.

Natural Selection and the Diversity of Life

Darwin proposed that natural selection, by its cumulative effects over vast spans of time, could produce new species from ancestral species. This would occur, for example, if a population fragmented into several populations isolated in different environments. In these various arenas of natural selection, what began as one species could gradually diversify into many species as the geographically isolated populations adapted over many generations to different sets of environmental problems (FIGURE 1.17).

Diversification of finches on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands.(a) The Gal&aacute;pagos, which Darwin visited in 1835, are a relatively young cluster of volcanic islands about 900 kilometers (540 miles) off the Pacific coast of South America. The islands are home to many species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world, though Gal&aacute;pagos life-forms are clearly related to species inhabiting the South American mainland. (b) Fourteen species of finches classified in three different genera diversified on the various islands of the Gal&aacute;pagos. These birds probably descended from a common ancestor that managed to reach the Gal&aacute;pagos from the South American mainland several million years ago after volcanism built the islands. Note the specialization of beaks, which are adapted to various food sources on the different islands.

Descent with modification accounts for both the unity and the diversity we observe in life. In many cases, features shared by two species are due to their descent from common ancestors, and differences between the species are due to natural selection modifying the ancestral equipment in different environmental contexts. Evolution is the core theme of biology--a unifying thread that ties every chapter of this text together.





 Science is a process of inquiry that includes repeatable observations and testable hypotheses

The word science is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to know." Science is a way of knowing. It emerges from our curiosity about ourselves, the world, and the universe. Striving to understand seems to be one of our basic drives. At the heart of science are people asking questions about nature and believing that those questions are answerable. Scientists tend to be quite passionate in their quest for discovery. Max Perutz, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, put it this way: "A discovery is like falling in love and reaching the top of a mountain after a hard climb all in one, an ecstasy induced not by drugs but by the revelation of a face of nature that no one has seen before."

The process of science blends two main types of exploration: discovery science and hypothetico-deductive science. Most scientists practice a combination of these two forms of inquiry.

Discovery Science and Induction

Science seeks natural causes for natural phenomena. This limits the scope of science to the study of structures and processes that we can observe and measure, either directly or indirectly with the help of tools such as microscopes that extend our senses. This dependence on observations that other people can confirm demystifies nature and distinguishes science from supernatural explanations. Science can neither prove nor disprove that angels, ghosts, deities, or spirits, both benevolent and evil, cause storms, rainbows, illnesses, and cures, for such explanations are outside the bounds of science.

Verifiable observations and measurements are the data of discovery science (FIGURE 1.18). In our quest to describe nature accurately, we discover its structure and behavior. In biology, discovery science enables us to describe life at its many levels, from ecosystems down to cells and molecules. A naturalist's careful description of diverse plants and animals is an example of discovery science, sometimes called descriptive science. A more recent example is the sequencing of the human genome; it's not really a set of experiments, but a detailed dissection and description of the genetic material.

Fig 1-18. Careful observation and measurement provide the raw data for science. Cornell University's Eloy Rodriguez collects a sample of chemicals extracted from a plant. His analysis will determine the types and amounts of chemicals in the plant.

In contrast to the carefully structured description of the human genome, curious and observant people sometimes make totally serendipitous discoveries. One of the most famous examples is Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery that certain fungi produce chemicals that kill bacteria. Fleming, a Scottish physician and microbiologist, was culturing bacteria in glass dishes in his laboratory. After finding that a mold (fungus) had contaminated some of his bacterial cultures, he was in the process of discarding the cultures when he noticed that no bacteria were growing in the vicinity of the mold. The fungus turned out to be a common bread mold named Penicillium, which produces an antibacterial chemical that was later named penicillin. Quite by accident, Fleming had made a discovery that led to the use of penicillin and other antibiotics to cure syphilis, meningitis, and many other diseases caused by bacteria.

Discovery science can lead to important conclusions based on a type of logic called inductive reasoning. An inductive conclusion is a generalization that summarizes many concurrent observations. "All organisms are made of cells" is an example. That induction was based on two centuries of biologists discovering cells in every biological specimen they observed with microscopes. The careful observations of discovery science and the inductive conclusions they sometimes produce are fundamental to our understanding of nature.

Hypothetico-Deductive Science

The observations of discovery science engage inquisitive minds to ask questions and seek explanations. Ideally, such investigation consists of what is called the scientific method. As a formal process of inquiry, the scientific method consists of a series of steps, but few scientists adhere rigidly to this prescription (FIGURE 1.19). Science is a less structured process than most people realize. Although it would be misleading to reduce science to a stereotyped method, we can identify the key element of the method. It is called hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The "hypothetico" refers to what scientists call hypotheses.

Fig 1-19. Idealized version of the scientific method. Although science rarely conforms exactly to this protocol of steps, inquiry usually involves posing and testing hypotheses.

A hypothesis is a tentative answer to some question--an explanation on trial. It is usually an educated guess. We all use hypotheses in solving everyday problems. Let's say, for example, that your flashlight fails during a camp-out. That's an observation. The question is obvious: Why doesn't the flashlight work? A reasonable hypothesis based on past experience is that the batteries in the flashlight are dead.

"If &#160;...&#160; then" Logic. The deductive in hypothetico-deductive reasoning refers to the use of deductive logic to test hypotheses. Deduction differs from induction, which, remember, is reasoning from a set of specific observations to reach a general conclusion. In deduction, the reasoning flows in the opposite direction, from the general to the specific. From general premises, we extrapolate to the specific results we should expect if the premises are true. If all organisms are made of cells (premise 1) and humans are organisms (premise 2), then humans are composed of cells (deductive prediction about a specific case).

In the process of science, the deduction usually takes the form of predictions about what outcomes of experiments or observations we should expect if a particular hypothesis (premise) is correct. We then test the hypothesis by performing the experiment to see whether or not the results are as predicted. This deductive testing takes the form of "If&#160;...&#160;then" logic:

OBSERVATION: My flashlight doesn't work.

QUESTION: What's wrong with my flashlight?

HYPOTHESIS: The flashlight's batteries are dead.

PREDICTION: If this hypothesis is correct

EXPERIMENT: and I replace the batteries with new ones,

PREDICTED RESULT: then the flashlight should work.

Let's say the flashlight still doesn't work. We can test an alternative hypothesis if new flashlight bulbs are available (FIGURE 1.20). We could also blame the dead flashlight on campground ghosts playing tricks, but that hypothesis is untestable and therefore outside the realm of science.

Fig 1-20. Applying hypothetico-deductive reasoning to a campground problem.

A Case Study. You should now be able to recognize the hypothetico-deductive process in an elegant study reported in the scientific literature. For many years, David Reznick of the University of California, Riverside, and John Endler of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have been investigating differences between populations of guppies in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are small freshwater fishes you probably recognize as common aquarium pets. In the Aripo River system of Trinidad, guppies live in small pools as populations that are relatively isolated from one another. In some cases, two populations inhabiting the same stream live less than 100 m (meters) apart, but they are separated by a waterfall that impedes the migration of guppies between the two pools.

When Reznick and Endler compared guppy populations, they observed differences in what are called life history characteristics. These characteristics included the average age and size of guppies when they reach sexual maturity and begin to reproduce. The researchers were able to correlate variations in these life history characteristics with the types of predators present in different locations. In some pools, the main predator is a small fish called a killifish, which preys predominantly on small, juvenile guppies. In other locations, a larger predator called a pike-cichlid preys more intensely on guppies and mainly eats relatively large, sexually mature individuals. Guppies in populations exposed to these pike-cichlids reproduce at a younger age and are smaller at maturity, on average, than guppies that coexist with killifish.

What causes these life history differences between the guppy populations? Correlation with the type of predator present is suggestive, but a correlation does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. The type of predator present and the life history characteristics of the guppy populations in a particular location may be independent consequences of some third factor. In fact, Reznick and Endler tested the hypothesis that the life history variations were due to differences in water temperature or other features of the physical environment. Notice the "If&#160;...&#160; then" logic characteristic of the hypothetico-deductive approach.

HYPOTHESIS #1: If differences in physical environments cause variations in the life histories of guppy populations,

EXPERIMENT: and samples from different wild guppy populations are collected and maintained for several generations in identical environments in predator-free aquaria,

PREDICTED RESULT: then the laboratory populations should become more similar in their life history characteristics.

When the researchers performed this experiment, the differences persisted for many generations. This result eliminates hypothesis #1 and also indicates that the life history differences in guppy populations are inherited. Based on the assumption that natural selection can lead to genetic differences in populations, Reznick and Endler tested the following explanation:

HYPOTHESIS #2: If the feeding preferences of different predators caused contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection,

EXPERIMENT: and guppies are transplanted from locations with pike-cichlids (predators of mature guppies) to guppy-free sites inhabited by killifish (predators of juvenile guppies),

PREDICTED RESULT: then the transplanted guppy populations should show a generation-to-generation trend toward later maturation and larger size--life history characteristics typical of natural guppy populations that coexist with killifish.

Reznick and Endler introduced guppies from locations with pike-cichlids to sites that had killifish but no guppies (FIGURE 1.21). Over a period of 11 years, the scientists compared the transplanted guppy populations with populations left in the pike-cichlid pools. The biologists measured such life history as age and size at maturity. To be certain that only heritable differences were counted, the scientists made their measurements after samples from the transplanted and non-transplanted guppy populations had been reared for two generations in identical aquarium environments. After 11 years, or 30 to 60 generations, the transplanted guppies had an average weight at maturity that was about 14%  greater than the guppies that were not transplanted to killifish pools. Other life history traits also changed in the direction predicted by the hypothesis that they type of predator affects the evolution of these traits in guppy populations (bar graphs in FIGURE 1.21).

Fig 1-21. Controlled experiments to test the hypothesis that selective predation affects the evolution of guppy populations.

The experimental design in our case study is an example of what scientists call a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, comparisons are made between two sets of subjects--guppy populations, in this case. The set that receives the experimental treatment is called the experimental group. In our example, the experimental group consisted of the guppies that Reznick and Endler transplanted from pike-cichlid pools to killifish pools. In contrast, the control group--the guppies that remained in the pike-cichlid pools, in this case--does not receive the experimental treatment. Ideally, the experimental treatment is the only difference between the experimental group and the control group. Such a controlled experiment enables researchers to focus on responses to a single variable--a change of predator in the guppy experiments.

Without a control group for comparison, there would be no way to tell whether it was the killifish or some other factor that caused the transplanted guppy populations to change. But because control sites and experimental sites were often nearby pools of the same stream, the main variable was probably the different predators. And the researchers observed similar results when guppies were reared in artificial streams that were identical except for the type of predator.

Of the several hypotheses Reznick and Endler have tested (we examined only two), they are left with natural selection due to differential predation on larger versus smaller guppies as the most likely explanation for the observed differences between guppy populations. Apparently, when predators such as pike-cichlids prey mainly on reproductively mature adults, the chance that a guppy will survive to reproduce several times is relatively low. The guppies with greatest reproductive success should then be the individuals that mature at a young age and small size and produce at least one brood before growing to a size preferred by the local predator. The controlled experiments of Reznick and Endler documented evolution in a natural setting over a relatively short time (within only 11 years in the study we have followed).

Our case study reinforces the important point that scientific hypotheses must be testable. Without such testing, ideas about nature, such as speculations on size differences in guppies, are "just so" stories. And explaining that something is true because "it's just so" is not very convincing.

Theories in Science

Many people associate facts with science, but accumulating facts is not what science is primarily about. A telephone book is an impressive catalog of factual information, but it has little to do with science. It is true that facts, in the form of verifiable observations and repeatable experimental results, are the prerequisites of science. What really advances science, however, is some new theory that ties together a number of observations and experimental results that previously seemed unrelated. The cornerstones of science are the explanations that apply to the greatest variety of phenomena. People like Newton, Darwin, and Einstein stand out in the history of science not because they discovered a great many facts, but because their theories had such broad explanatory power.

What is a scientific theory, and how is it different from a hypothesis? Compared with a hypothesis, a theory is much broader in scope. This is a hypothesis: "Feeding preferences of different predators cause contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection." But this is a theory: "Populations can evolve by natural selection because of feeding preferences of predators."

Because theories are so comprehensive, they only become widely accepted in science if they are supported by an accumulation of extensive and varied evidence. This use of the term theory in science for a comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence contrasts with our everyday usage, which equates theories more with speculations or hypotheses. Natural selection qualifies as a scientific theory because of its broad application and because it has been validated by a continuum of observations and experiments. (You will find many examples in Units Four and Eight of this textbook.)

Scientific theories are not the only way of "knowing nature," of course. A comparative religion course would be an excellent opportunity to learn about the diverse legends that tell of a supernatural creation of Earth and its life. Science and religion are two very different ways of trying to make sense of nature. Art is still another way. A broad education should include exposure to these different ways of viewing nature. Each of us synthesizes our worldview by integrating our life experiences and multidisciplinary education. As a science textbook that is part of that broad education, Biology showcases life in the scientific context of evolution, the one theme that continues to hold all of biology together no matter how big and complex the subject becomes.

Science as a Social Process

The Hollywood image of the socially challenged scientist working alone in a secluded laboratory is as much a false stereotype as the idea that scientists always practice the scientific method in rigid lockstep. The reality is that science is an intensely social activity. Most scientists work in teams, and in academic environments the research groups often include both graduate and undergraduate students (FIGURE 1.22). If you survey the table of contents of some scientific journals in your college library, you'll find that the majority of articles are coauthored by teams of two or more scientists. And those journal articles make another point about the social nature of science: Research results are inert until shared with a broader community of peers.

It is not unusual that several scientists are asking the same questions. Such convergence contributes to the progressive and self-correcting qualities of science. Scientists build on what has been learned from earlier research, and they pay close attention to contemporary scientists working in the same field. Scientists share information through publications, seminars, meetings, and personal communication. The Internet has added a new medium for this exchange of ideas and data.

Both cooperation and competition characterize the scientific culture. Scientists working in the same research field subject one another's work to careful scrutiny. It is common for scientists to check on each other's claims by attempting to repeat experiments. This obsession with evidence and confirmation helps characterize the scientific style of inquiry. Scientists are generally skeptics.

We have seen that science has two related features that distinguish it from other styles of inquiry: (1) a dependence on observations and measurements that others can verify and (2) the requirement that ideas (hypotheses and theories) are testable by observations and experiments that others can repeat.

Throughout this book, you will find many examples of science in action, each marked by the icon that is shown on the right.

The Cultural Context of Science

The sociology of biology extends beyond the boundaries of the scientific community; science as a whole is embedded in the culture of its times. Just one example is the increasing proportion of women in biology and the impact they are having on the research being performed. A few decades ago, for instance, biologists who studied the mating behavior of animals focused most of their attention on competition among males for access to females. More recent research is revealing the role that females play in choosing mates. For example, in many bird species, females prefer the bright coloration that "advertises" a male's vigorous health, a behavior that enhances the probability of having healthy offspring.

Some philosophers of science argue that scientists are so influenced by cultural and political values that science is no more objective than other ways of "knowing nature." At the other extreme are people who speak of scientific theories as though they were natural laws instead of human interpretations of nature. The reality of science is probably somewhere in between. The cultural milieu affects scientific fashion, but the criterion of repeatability in observation and hypothesis testing still defines science as fundamentally different from other strategies of knowing nature. This distinction also contrasts the provisional status of science-based knowledge with unconditional beliefs based on faith. There are many examples of cherished hypotheses and even theories in science that were eventually remodeled or rejected in light of compelling new data. A hundred years ago, for instance, most biologists agreed that fungi and bacteria were types of plants. And there are also cases of entrenched theories that went unchallenged for too long because they fit so comfortably into the current cultural context or because there was a tendency to reject evidence that "rocked the boat." The theory of a geocentric (Earth-centered) universe is an example. But such historical examples of theories that persisted in science in spite of their incompatibility with an accumulation of repeatable measurements and experiments are relatively rare. If there is "truth" in science, it is based on a preponderance of the available evidence.





 Science and technology are functions of society

Science and technology are associated. In many cases, technology results from scientific discoveries applied to the development of goods and services. Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA through the process of science. This breakthrough sparked an explosion of scientific activity that led to a better understanding of DNA chemistry and the genetic code. These discoveries eventually made it possible to manipulate DNA, enabling genetic technologists to transplant foreign genes into microorganisms and mass-produce such valuable products as human insulin. The new biotechnology is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry, and DNA technology has also had an enormous impact in other areas, including agriculture and the legal profession (FIGURE 1.23). Perhaps Watson and Crick envisioned that their discovery would someday have technological applications, but that was probably not what motivated their research; nor could they have predicted exactly what the applications would be.

Fig 1-23. Two examples of DNA technology.

Not all technology can be described as applied science. In fact, technology predates science, driven by inventive humans who built tools, crafted pots, mixed paints, designed musical instruments, and made clothing--all without necessarily understanding why their inventions worked. Science catalyzes certain technologies by complementing trial and error with more informed design. But the direction technology takes depends less on science than it does on the needs of humans and the values of society.

Technology has improved our standard of living in many ways, but not without introducing some new problems. Technology, especially technology that keeps people healthier, has enabled the human population to grow more than tenfold in the past three centuries. The environmental consequences are enormous. Acid rain, deforestation, global warming, nuclear accidents, ozone holes, toxic wastes, landscapes degraded by exploration for oil and other natural resources, and extinction of species are just a few of the repercussions from more and more people wielding more and more technology. Science can help us identify problems and provide insight about what course of action may prevent further damage. But solutions to these problems have as much to do with politics, economics, culture, and values as with science and technology.

Now that both science and technology have become such powerful functions of society, it is more important than ever to distinguish "what we would like to understand" from "what we would like to build." Scientists should not distance themselves from technology but instead try to influence how scientific discoveries are applied. And scientists have a responsibility to help educate politicians, bureaucrats, corporate leaders, and voters about how science works and about the potential benefits and hazards of specific technologies. The crucial relationship between science, technology, and society is a theme that increases the significance of any biology course.
