Species that occupy the same geographic area often live in separate habitats (habitat isolation); possess unique, exclusive mating signals and courtship behaviors (behavioral isolation); breed at different times (temporal isolation); and/or have anatomically incompatible reproductive organs (mechanical isolation) or incompatible sex cells (gametic isolation). Even if two different species manage to mate, postzygotic barriers usually prevent the interspecific hybrids from developing into adults, breeding with either parent species, or producing viable, fertile offspring.</p></LI><LI><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The biological species concept has some major limitations (p. 468)</span> For instance, it is not applicable to fossils or to organisms that reproduce only asexually.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species (p. 468)</span> Alternative concepts include the ecological species concept, which explains the similarity among members of a species by their adaptation to exploit a particular set of ecological resources (or niche); the morphological species concept, which defines species by phenotypic characteristics; pluralistic species concept, suggesting that different factors operate in different creatures to explain why species exist; and a genealogical species concept, which defines a species by the close genetic relatedness among its members.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">MODES OF SPECIATION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species (pp. 469-473,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 24.6</span>-<span class="SmallCap">24.12</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Allopatric speciation may occur when two populations of one species become geographically separated from each other.
