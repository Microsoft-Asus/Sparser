SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Quickening the pace of its economic restructuring , South Korea on Thursday announced a list of 55 companies it deems so financially weak they should be liquidated .
Although the firms have debts totaling dlrs 12.14 billion , most are small and analysts viewed the government 's action as at best a first step toward revamping the nation 's industries .
`` It is a good signal for potential foreign investors because it shows that South Korea is really determined to reform its industries , '' said Lee Ji -soon , an economist at Seoul National University .
`` But if you look at the companies , most of them are quite small and insignificant , `` Lee said .
`` I am not sure if it will be enough to let reluctant foreign investors make a commitment .
`` I would call it the first step for future reforms , '' Lee said .
`` To earn real trust by foreign investors , South Korea should continue swift and large-scale reforms of its conglomerates . ''
The move was the latest in a series of reforms South Korea has promised to the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout in December .
`` This is the beginning of our restructuring efforts .
There will be more follow-up measures , including major deals in which big companies will swap their subsidiaries to become more competitive , '' Lee Hun -jae , head of the Financial Supervisory Commission , told a news conference .
Lee 's commission , which acts as the government 's financial watchdog , oversaw the compilation of the list by major creditor banks .
`` One of the key functions of the banking sector is to ferret out unhealthy businesses , '' Lee said .
`` But so far , the function has been absent , resulting in a mass of nonviable companies . ''
Lee said that creditors banks will force the nonviable companies to fold at the earliest possible date by halting new loans and calling in old ones .
Lee said that government-controlled commercial banks also would be asked to withhold loans to major conglomerates unless they swap key , overlapping industries .
He specifically cited automobile manufacturing as one area in which such a swap is necessary .
South Korea 's car industry , the world 's fifth largest with four major manufacturers , is in deep trouble with slumping sales at home and abroad .
Samsung 's late entry into the car market this year added to the problem .
Local reports said that Samsung , Hyundai and LG are under government pressure to swap their car , petrochemical and semiconductor businesses .
Bae Chan -byung , head of Commercial Bank of Korea , said that Thursday 's list was made after a month-long survey of 313 heavily indebted companies .
Major companies on the list include the nation 's second largest confectionery , Haitai , which is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy with at least 1 trillion won -LRB- dlrs 715 million -RRB- in bank debts .
Also included is Hanil Synthetic Fiber Co. , the nation 's largest acrylic fiber maker , whose debts are 1,039 times its assets .
Hanil , with six subsidiaries , is South Korea 's 34th largest conglomerate .
The nation 's top five conglomerates -- Hyundai , Samsung , LG , Daewoo and SK -- had 20 subsidiaries listed for liquidation , none of them significant .
Banking officials said President Kim Dae -jung approved the list Wednesday .
Kim has been pushing for massive corporate and financial reforms .
He has already shut down 14 merchant banks , and plans to consolidate other financial institutions as part of his efforts to regain foreign confidence , which is badly needed to overcome the country 's currency and debt crisis .
