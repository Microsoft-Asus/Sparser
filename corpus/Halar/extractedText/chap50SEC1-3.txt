AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL BIOMES

 

 Aquatic biomes occupy the largest part of the biosphere



 

 The geographic distribution of terrestrial biomes is based mainly on regional variations in climate



Having examined some of the factors that determine the distribution of organisms on Earth, we now turn to a brief survey of the major types of ecosystems, the biomes, beginning with the aquatic biomes (FIGURE 50.17).
