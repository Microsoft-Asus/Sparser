SEOUL , June 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea is trying to downplay the incursion of a submarine of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- into South Korean waters , in the hope that the incident will not affect improved inter- Korean relations .
A DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean Navy Monday afternoon after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet off the East Sea , some 11 miles of South Korea 's Sokcho city .
The incident has cast a shadow over the improving atmosphere between the two sides since Kim Dae -jung became South Korean president on February 25 this year .
Analysts say the incident might temper President Kim 's `` aggressive '' engagement policy towords the DPRK based on his principle of separating politics from business and force him to change his policy under pressures from the military and opposition party .
However , the Kim Dae -jung government has taken unusual measures in response to the sub incident , which , South Korean military authorities and opposition party alleged , was a military aggression and a violation of the military armistice agreement signed in 1953 .
Tuesday , one day after the incident , President Kim said his government would assess the incident in a cautious manner after a comprehensive investigation of the sub , and on Wednesday he said he would not change his `` sunshine policy '' of more dialogues , more reconciliation and more cooperation with the DPRK .
Some analysts say Kim 's government has intentionally slowed down the tugging of the sunk sub to a South Korean naval base to win the time necessary to minimize the incident 's impact on the ongoing `` friendly atmosphere '' characterized by South Korean business tycoon Chung Ju -yung 's recent historic visit to the DPRK via the truce village of Panmunjom and a military general-level dialogue between U.S. and DPRK armed forces .
The resumption of the high-level military talks and Chung 's passage through Panmunjom were hailed by the Kim Dae -jung government as an indication that the DPRK was easing its `` hardline stance . ''
Such response is in sharp contrast to a similar event which flared in September 1996 , which witnessed inter- Korean ties hit their lowest ebb .
The then Kim Young -sam government had immediately described the DPRK 's submarine infiltration as `` a clear armed provocation '' and severed all contacts with the DPRK while referring the issue to the United Nations for a sanction against the country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The incident terribly strained the inter- Korean relations for a prolonged period though the Kim Young -sam administration successfully forced the DPRK to issue an apology in December 1996 .
`` The past government failed to maintain consistency in dealing with North Korean affairs .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">We will go ahead with the sunshine policy aimed at opening the North and expanding inter- Korean exchanges , '' said Park Jie -won , South Korean presidential spokesman .</ENAMEX>
`` The incident further awakened us to the need to engage the North in a more positive manner , '' said Li Dong -won , President Kim 's top foreign policy and security advisor .
Some observers predicted that President Kim will return the sub to the DPRK as another significant friendly gesture no matter whether the sub infiltrated into South Korean waters for a spy mission or drifted there due to mechanical problems as the DPRK claimed , but he needs an official apology or regret from the DPRK to clear away concerns in his country .
