\fs30 \cf0 From the triumphant tone of some public statements and news coverage after Gustav passed through, it would be easy to think that the upgraded hurricane protection system in New Orleans had passed its first big test and that it\'92s all bon temps from here.\
But complacency is as big a threat as wind and storm surge to a city that still has a long way to go \'97 especially in light of rising oceans and a subsiding landscape.\
Gustav had looked like a monster on its way toward land. On Saturday, Aug. 30, the National Hurricane Center described Gustav as an \'93extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane\'94 that could become a Category 5, and was on a track that would take it slightly to the west of New Orleans. Mayor {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/c_ray_nagin/index.html?inline=nyt-per"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 C. Ray Nagin}} ordered an evacuation for what he called \'93the mother of all storms,\'94 and an estimated two million people got out of southern {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/louisiana/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Louisiana}} before the storm hit on Monday.\
By landfall on Monday morning, however Gustav had weakened considerably and its track had slipped a bit farther west. The impact on New Orleans was blessedly slight.\
Lt. Gen. Robert L. Van Antwerp, the commanding general of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/army_corps_of_engineers/index.html?inline=nyt-org"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Army Corps of Engineers}}, said last week that good news about the storm could leave officials who had urged evacuation open to criticism of crying wolf \'97 the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\'92t conundrum that comes with any hurricane. \'93I would hope this wouldn\'92t cause people to say, \'91next time, we\'92re not going,\'92\'a0\'94 he said. \'93You were taking a real gamble if you don\'92t do exactly what people did.\'94\
After all, he said, \'93what if the track had been 30 miles different and had gone east? And it could have.\'94 When it comes to evacuations, better safe than sorry, the general said. \'93That was a big lesson of Katrina.\'94\
A panel from the American Society of Civil Engineers that was formed to review the corps investigation of levee failures in Katrina also argued against complacency in a statement issued last week: \'93While the region\'92s residents may be breathing a sigh of relief at Gustav\'92s near-miss, they should not allow a sense of false security to settle in\'94 \'97 especially since \'93another \'91Katrina-like\'92 hurricane is inevitable.\'94\
Within the corps itself, the fact that New Orleans remains a city with unfinished defenses is no secret. \'93We feel confident that this system is much stronger than it was in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricane_katrina/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Hurricane Katrina}},\'94 Col. Al Lee, commander of the New Orleans district of the corps, said the day before the storm hit the coast. But he also admitted the obvious: \'93I want everybody to understand \'97 we\'92re not there yet.\'94\
Many elements of the patchwork of new and old levees, floodwalls, gates and pumps performed very well in the storm, but there were plenty of close calls. Efforts by the corps to improve protection to meet what\'92s called the 100-year level \'97 strong enough to prevent the kind of flooding that has a 1 percent chance of occurring any given year \'97 are not going to be completed until 2011 at the earliest. Until then, the city remains at risk of suffering grave damage in even a moderate storm.\
In fact, Gustav could have been much worse for the city. Among the disasters narrowly averted, even in this storm\'92s glancing blow:\
\'b6In the vulnerable West Bank communities across the Mississippi from New Orleans, the levee and floodwall work \'97 originally authorized by Congress in 1986 \'97 was still only about 30 percent complete when Katrina hit. Some stretches of levee along the Harvey Canal are just six feet high, and there are still gaps where elements of the West Bank system have not yet been tied together with the Mississippi levees. Even a modest surge from Gustav would have swamped an area that many New Orleanians had moved to after Katrina because it had not been badly damaged and was considered safe.\
\'b6Another canal on the West Bank town of Westwego, known as the Company Canal, nearly breached during Gustav. The corps determined that the Company Canal\'92s floodwalls were so weak that they probably couldn\'92t handle rising water. Last year, the corps, as a quick fix, put a gate across that canal. The gate prevented an almost inevitable breach during Gustav, but the water seal on the gate turned out to be leaky. So the corps went through an overnight scramble to get a powerful 30-inch pump in place so water could be drained to safe levels.\
\'b6In New Orleans itself, the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, a large waterway that connects Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, barges and ships from the Southern Scrap Company broke loose and floated into the canal during the storm. Only luck kept some of the floating debris from turning into battering rams against floodwalls. Those floodwalls, however, held \'97 even when water rose to the top and sloshed over for hours.\
Timothy Doody, the president of the levee authority for New Orleans and the communities along the Mississippi River\'92s East Bank, said that the images of water splashing over the tops of the floodwalls were frightening. His home, in St. Bernard Parish, could well have been flooded (again) if the east floodwall had breached. The corps insists that its floodwalls are designed to take water to the top and over without failing, but everyone in New Orleans knows that some of them failed during Katrina when the water was at far lower levels. \'93It wasn\'92t a comfort,\'94 he said.\
\'93You don\'92t want to test the design height of a floodwall,\'94 Mr. Doody said. \'93Watching that test, and knowing that your house is on the other side of that test \'97 it\'92s a pass-fail. And the last time was a fail.\'94\
Now is no time for self-congratulation, he said. \'93We\'92ve got to finish the system \'97 we have got to remain focused.\'94\
Even after 2011, Colonel Lee said, \'93there will still be residual risk in the system\'94 if severe storms threaten. That doesn\'92t mean New Orleans is an unreasonably dangerous place to live. But it does mean that anyone who chooses to live there will do so with open eyes, after truly considering the risk.\
That\'92s the balancing process that anyone engages in, whether they are Nebraskans factoring in tornadoes, Californians weighing earthquakes or New Yorkers considering another terrorist attack or crane collapse. Nervousness \'97 not panic, but good, healthy jitters \'97 should be part of anyone\'92s complex calculus of risk and reward, head, heart and wallet.\
