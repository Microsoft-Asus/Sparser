MOSCOW , October 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Russian federal troops continued their blockade Sunday of the border between the breakaway republic of Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia while launching more aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions</ENAMEX> .
The Federal Security Service -LRB- FSB -RRB- , the main successor to the KGB , said the move was taken to reinforce the zone of security on the border to prevent rebels from entering neighboring regions to stage terrorist attacks .
Before the enhanced border control , the FSB said , only one of the six roads that run across the border was under federal control as to the flow to motor vehicles and refugees , the Interfax news agency reported .
It said Chechen fuel and lubricants had earlier been transported to and sold in Ingushetia and that proceeds were used by illegal armed units .
The FSB also said some terrorists were trying to get into neighboring regions , disguising as refugees .
`` Significantly , the bands ' chiefs -LRB- Shamil -RRB- Basayev and Khattab assign them for concrete tasks to carry out sabotage and terrorist actions in Moscow , St. Petersburg , and other territories of Russia , '' it said .
`` Besides , it has been established that due to the lack of control by local authorities in Ingushetia , incoming humanitarian aid is partially stolen , and actually gets into the hands of bandits in Chechnya , '' the FSB said .
Meanwhile , Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said he wants to appeal to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to ease the blockade to allow the movement of Chechen refugees .
`` These roads were the main corridor for refugees .
Now these people , most of them women , old people and children , have no way to leave Chechnya , '' he said .
`` War should be waged against bandits and terrorists , not against refugees , '' Aushev said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The number of refugees in Ingushetia has swelled to 169,700 , and the tiny republic is `` suffocating under such a tide of refugees , '' he said</ENAMEX> .
