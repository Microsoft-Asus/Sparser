TOKYO --
Amid an explosion of camera flashes and a frenzy of speculation over future threats from the sect , Japan Wednesday released the charismatic spokesman of the religious cult responsible for the deadly gas attack on Tokyo 's subway system in 1995 .
The spokesman , Fumihiro Joyu , 37 , is the group 's de facto No. 2 figure .
He had been imprisoned since 1997 on perjury charges unrelated to the attack with sarin gas , which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000 .
A white van carrying Joyu from a prison in Hiroshima for a flight to Tokyo and another van that took him from Haneda Airport were tracked by helicopter-borne cameras broadcasting live on national television .
On the ground , an army of other journalists followed him in cars as he made his way from the airport toward the Hilton Hotel in Shinjuku , one of the Tokyo 's most crowded districts .
In the weeks leading up to Joyu 's release , hand wringing was rampant in Japan about the possible resurrection of his group , Aum Shinrikyo , under the leadership of a man who was once -- even shortly after the attack -- as popular as any rock star in this country .
The doe-eyed Joyu 's boyish good looks and reputation for cunning made him a teen idol for both sexes and have long been considered to be among his sect 's greatest assets .
Aum 's paramount leader , the blind guru-like figure Shoko Asahara , 44 , is currently on trial on charges of ordering the subway attack .
Two of the group 's other leaders have been convicted and may face the death penalty .
Joyu was leading Aum 's Russian chapter at the time and was not charged in the attack .
He was detained in a Hiroshima prison on perjury charges relating to an illegal real estate deal .
Reflecting the deepening sense of public disapproval toward the group , Joyu was denied a room at the hotel and spent the next several hours wending his way around the city , reporters in tow , in search of a place to stay .
In the end the group settled on housing him in the apartment of another member in the nearby city of Yokohama , where television crews and more than 100 reporters quickly set up their stakeout positions .
The circus that followed drew crowds of onlookers and protests from right-wing groups circulating in sound trucks blasting slogans like : `` Out with Aum !
Out with Joyu ! ''
`` I do n't want to have him in a neighboring building , but there is nothing I can do about it '' said Yoko Kawabata , a grocery store owner whose shop abuts the apartment building where Joyu is apparently staying .
`` I cannot forgive Aum as a group .
They 've committed too many crimes .
But I do n't think Joyu in particular is guilty , though . ''
Joyu planned to hold a news conference on his release from jail , but a mob scene outside the prison seemed to have taken him aback , causing him to change plans .
`` I was originally planning to give a press conference here , but for various reasons , I am sorry to say that I have decided to cancel it , '' Joyu said in a written statement issued in his name by Aum Shinrikyo .
In the only indication of his plans , he said he was returning to the sect , in Tokyo , but intended to `` rest quietly for a while . ''
Partly in anticipation of his release , the government recently won passage of a new law giving it broad powers to suppress any organization that has committed `` indiscriminate mass murder during the last 10 years . ''
By February the country 's Public Security Examination Commission is widely expected to rule that the government may apply the new law to Aum , thereby requiring the group to submit reports on its members ' activities and assets every three months .
Aum Shinrikyo , for its part , has fought back with something of a charm campaign recently , apologizing for the sarin attack for the first time and making an unusual pledge to refrain from recruiting new members .
Although there has been heated speculation in recent days , experts are as divided about the group 's future as they are about Joyu 's future role .
Experts who have long followed Aum say the group faces a difficult choice in deciding what public role Joyu should now assume .
Shoko Egawa , one authority on the group , described Joyu as something of an organizational genius who has `` aggressively taken part in the management of the cult , '' but who has come to be deeply associated in the public mind with the gas attack .
`` Right after his release he may provide a kind of stimulus to the group , '' Ms. Egawa said .
`` But Aum understands that if they use him as a front man they will be damaged , because if they have a man who was involved in the sarin attack as a spokesman , it proves that the group has n't changed . ''
