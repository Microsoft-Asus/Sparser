This would be an example of asexual reproduction: offspring derived from a single parent without genetic recombination (which, of course, does not actually occur in humans). The result would be a clone, a population of asexually produced, genetically identical organisms. Many plant species clone themselves by asexual reproduction, also called <span class="Emphasis2">vegetative reproduction.</span></p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Asexual reproduction is an extension of the capacity of plants for indeterminate growth. Plants, remember, have meristematic tissues of dividing, undifferentiated cells that can sustain or renew growth indefinitely. In addition, parenchyma cells throughout the plant can divide and differentiate into the various types of specialized cells, enabling plants to regenerate lost parts. Detached fragments of some plants can develop into whole offspring; a severed stem, for instance, may develop adventitious roots and become a whole plant. <span class="Emphasis2">Fragmentation,</span> the separation of a parent plant into parts that re-form whole plants, is one of the most common modes of vegetative reproduction (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.15a</span>). A variation of this process occurs in some species of dicots, in which the root system of a single parent gives rise to many adventitious shoots that become separate shoot systems. The result is a clone formed by asexual reproduction from one parent (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.15b</span>). Such asexual propagation has produced the oldest of all known plant clones, a ring of creosote bushes in the Mojave Desert of California, believed to be at least 12,000 years old.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig38-15','../fig/big/fig38-15.jpg','fig38-15');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig38-15.jpg" alt="fig38-15" name="myfig38-15"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 38-15.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Natural mechanisms of vegetative reproduction.

This asexual production of seeds is called <span class="Emphasis2">apomixis.</span> A diploid cell in the ovule gives rise to the embryo, and the ovules mature into seeds, which in the dandelion are dispersed by windblown fruit. Thus, though these plants clone themselves by an asexual process, they also have the advantage of seed dispersal, an adaptation usually associated with sexual reproduction.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
