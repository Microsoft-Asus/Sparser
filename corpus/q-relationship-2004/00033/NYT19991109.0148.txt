TOKYO --
The mood in Japan on the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall is in stark contrast to the euphoria felt immediately after the historic event .
`` The past 10 years have been a great disappointment in just about every field , including economics and politics , '' said Terumasa Nakanishi , a professor of international relations at Kyoto University .
In Japan , a country whose foremost self-identify lies with its economic power , the past 10 years can be summarized as a humiliating decade with no bright prospects in sight .
One comparison helps explain why many economists call the past 10 years a `` lost decade . ''
Japan 's key stock index , the Nikkei Stock Average , closed at 35,657.42 yen -LRB- $ 340 -RRB- on Nov. 9 , 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall came down .
At that time , the stock market was said to be defying the law of gravity amid Japan 's high-flying period of asset-inflation economic growth .
Ten years later , the index has been nearly cut in half , opening at 18,470.22 on Nov. 8 .
One report , issued by the Economic Planning Agency the day after the Berlin Wall collapsed , would sound totally out of context if it were applied on Nov. 8 .
The agency 's study said the reason why Japanese could not feel affluent despite their materially enriched lifestyles and increased wages was because they worked too many hours .
The report said Japanese should work less .
The overriding concern for workers on Nov. 9 , 1999 is job security .
And the cries of joy shared by the Japanese when the Berlin Wall collapse can no longer be heard here .
Reflecting the low-key mood , the government has no plans to observe the 10th anniversary with any special event .
`` The anniversary does not give us any special feeling because the post- Cold War era has become so much a part of us that we do n't find the 10th anniversary a special one , '' a senior Foreign Ministry official said .
Nakanishi said Japan lost the past decade not just on the economic front but also on the diplomatic front .
He pointed to Tokyo 's failure to resolve the Northern Territories dispute with Russia and the fact that Asia remains plagued with Cold War legacies such as the potentially explosive Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan problem .
As a sense of insecurity prevailed in the nation , the word `` adrift '' was often used to describe not only the status of the nation 's economy but also the status of the Japan - U.S. Security Treaty -- the postwar foundation of Japan 's diplomacy .
`` It is meaningful to think about the past 10 years in terms of change in the meaning of alliances , '' one senior Foreign Ministry official commented .
Reflecting such uneasy sentiment over such changes , Washington 's commitment to the Japan - U.S. Security Treaty was questioned at a recent study forum organized by the Foreign Ministry .
Yukio Okamoto , a former diplomat who runs an international consulting firm , said Washington 's commitment to Japan has weakened .
Shotaro Oshima , director-general of the Economic Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry , echoed Okamoto 's comments .
`` I feel the same way , '' Oshima said .
`` For example , the U.S. government has clearly distanced itself from the Japan - China dispute over the Senkaku Islands .
This stance has made me wonder if it reflected a change in its attitude toward its security commitment . ''
Nakanishi observed : `` Japan has not been able to know what to make of the meaning of the end of the Cold War .
As far as the Japan - U.S. security alliance is concerned , Japan had no choice but to try to stick to the alliance in the continued uncertain and unstable security environment in Asia , even after the Cold War ended . ''
Takakazu Kuriyama , who was vice foreign minister when the Berlin Wall fell , said the government had been justified in redefining and maintaining the alliance .
`` We needed to have an alliance with a strong country that has a keen interest in Asia , '' he said .
He also pointed to the fact that 10 years after the Cold War ended , Japan 's political standing in Asia is still limited by its legacy in World War II .
`` Due to Asian nations ' sentiments -LRB- lingering from the war -RRB- , Japan is still not allowed to try to go it alone , '' Kuriyama said .
On the political front , one thing was certain : The end of the Cold War drastically changed the nation 's political landscape .
`` For domestic Japanese politics , the end of the Cold War meant that the LDP 's factional dispute would no longer be contained within the boundaries of the LDP itself , '' Gerald Curtis , a professor of Japanese politics at Columbia University , wrote in his recently published book , `` The Logic of Japanese Politics . ''
Since 1993 , Japan has witnessed five coalition governments , including the current one that comprises the LDP , the Liberal Party and New Komeito .
Takamitsu Sawa , a professor of economics at Kyoto University , laments that there has been very little ideological debate on economic and welfare policy in Japan over the past decade .
`` Ten years ago , Japan was filled with self-confidence , but now its mainstream thinking calls for reform toward -LRB- American -style -RRB- market economy , despite the fact that the Asian financial crisis proved that market economy globalization was hardly stable , '' the economist said .
`` Over the past decade , the poverty of Japan 's intellectual power has become very visible , failing to create a national debate on such fundamental ideological issues as economic and welfare policy like Britain 's debate on the `` Third Way , '' initiated by Prime Minister Tony Blair , '' Sawa said .
Last week , the coalition government decided to temporarily ease the burden on those who will pay for the new nursing care program -- a move viewed as a transparent ploy to please voters ahead of the next Lower House election , which must be held within a year .
The relief measures were announced as the outstanding balance of government bonds , which stood at 258 trillion yen , is projected to exceed 330 trillion yen by the end of the current fiscal year .
This means that the debts in the Japanese government sector , including local governments , would surpass 600 trillion yen -- the worst figure among industrialized democracies .
Yet , there has been no fundamental philosophical debate on welfare and economic policy in the decision-making process .
