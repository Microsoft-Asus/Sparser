GENEVA , March 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- is appealing for 60 million U.S. dollars Friday for the voluntary repatriation of up to 739,000 Liberian refugees .
The U.N. humanitarian agency needs 39 million dollars this year and 21 million in the first half of 1997 to cover the cost of transportation , food , tents and other necessities for the return of the Liberian refugees , who fled their homes after civil war broke out in December , 1989 .
The agency 's appeal has been prompted by the return of large numbers of refugees following the signing of a peace agreement last August in the tiny west African country of 2.5 million people .
It says a growing influx of refugees , about 30,000 of whom have returned since August , would cause chaos without adequate funding .
Liberian authorities said the refugees have returned spontaneously from border areas of Cote d 'Ivoire and Guinea , mostly within the past two months .
UNHCR said that lack of funds and sporadic fighting in Liberia have prevented it from helping the repatriation of some 739,000 refugees - 410,000 from Guinea , 305,800 from Cote d 'Ivoire , 15,000 from Ghana and the rest from Nigeria and Sierra Leone .
About 150,000 people were killed and one million made homeless during the six-year civil war .
The agency said that organized repatriation of refugees would also depend on the deployment of West African peacekeepers throughout Liberia , disarmament and demobilization of troops , and the central government taking back control of the country .
