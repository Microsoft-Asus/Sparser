-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The impoverished Russian residents of the Kuril Islands back a petition that calls for leasing the disputed territory to Japan for 99 years , a news agency reported Monday .
Igor Farkhutdinov , the governor of the Russia 's eastern Sakhalin Island , and the man who also oversees the Kurils , said the petition drive had shown the depth of the despair over the region 's worsening economic condition .
The petition has been supported by the vast majority of the 2,500 adult residents of the Shikotan Island , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
Shikotan is the largest of the four islands in the Kuril Chain that Russia seized from Japan at the end of the World War II .
Relations are improving between the countries , but the dispute over the Kurils has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a peace treaty formally ending their hostilities .
