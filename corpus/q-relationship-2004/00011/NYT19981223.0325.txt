NEW YORK --
The United States has ordered the expulsion of three Cuban diplomats after accusing them of participating in a Cuban spy ring that infiltrated the US military and plotted the bombing of a Florida airfield , according to the Clinton administration .
US officials said Wednesday the three Cuban envoys , stationed at the Cuban mission to the United Nations , have until Monday to leave the country .
They said two other New York -based Cuban diplomats linked to the Miami operation have already left the country .
The diplomats were expelled for `` activities incompatible with their status as members of the United Nations , '' said State Department spokesman James P. Rubin .
`` This came to light as a result of evidence the FBI collected on a Miami -based ring of Cuban spies in September , '' added another State Department official .
The Cuban spy network , led by a Cuban military captain named Manuel Viramontes , produced detailed reports for Havana on US combat readiness , air and naval maneuvers , and other activities by the US Southern Command , which is responsible for managing US military operations in Latin America .
In the largest intelligence crackdown since the 1959 Cuban revolution , federal agents arrested 10 Cubans on Sept. 13 .
Seized in the raid were three laptop computers , radio communication equipment , and a computer disk with a coded reference to Fidel Castro and plans to sabotage an unidentified aircraft hangar .
White House and State Department officials declined to provide details on the role of the Cuban diplomats -- identified as Eduardo Martinez Borbonez , Roberto Arzana Paez , and Gonzalo Fernandez Garay .
Unconfirmed wire service reports identified them as `` paymasters , '' `` couriers '' or `` case officers . ''
The United States decided to act after the Cuban mission ignored a written request on Monday from Washington to explain the Cubans ' role in the affair .
The United States sent another letter to the Cuban mission Wednesday demanding that the diplomats leave by Monday .
The Cuban mission to the UN has long had a troubled relationship with the United States .
Since 1982 , 12 Cubans have been expelled from the mission , Cuba 's only diplomatic post in the United States .
In 1995 , three Cuban diplomats were thrown out of the United States after one of them punched a New York City police officer during a fight with anti- Castro protesters outside the Cuban mission to the United Nations .
The others , including a Cuban diplomat filmed by a Miami television station while meeting an FBI double agent at a New York restaurant in 1992 , were expelled for `` activities inconsistent with their diplomatic duties . ''
They were accused of spying .
The Cubans ' chief targets were the Boca Chica Naval Air Station in Key West ; MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa ; and the US Southern Command .
One of the suspects , Antonio Guerrero , was a mechanic at the Key West Naval base .
The group had also successfully infiltrated Miami anti- Castro exile community .
Rene Gonzalez , a Cuban exile who defected from Cuba in 1990 , was embraced by two prominent anti- Castro Cuban exile organizations .
Since arriving at the Boca Chica Naval Air Station in a 1940s crop duster , Gonzalez has worked as a pilot for Brothers to the Rescue , an anti- Castro group that searches for Cuban boat people en route to Miami , and the Cuban Democracy Movement .
The Cuban mission had no comment .
