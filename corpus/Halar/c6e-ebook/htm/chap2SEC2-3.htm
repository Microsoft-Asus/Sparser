Each electron has one unit of negative charge, and each proton has one unit of positive charge. A neutron, as its name implies, is electrically neutral. Protons give the nucleus a positive charge, and it is the attraction between opposite charges that keeps the rapidly moving electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The neutron and proton are almost identical in mass, each about 1.7 &#160;X&#160; 10<SUP>-24</SUP> gram (g). Grams and other conventional units are not very useful for describing the mass of objects so minuscule. Thus, for atoms and subatomic particles (and for molecules, as well), we use a unit of measurement called the <span class="Emphasis2">dalton,</span> in honor of John Dalton, the British scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800. (The dalton is the same as the <span class="Emphasis1">atomic mass unit,</span> or <span class="Emphasis1">amu,</span> a unit you may have encountered elsewhere.) Neutrons and protons have masses close to 1 dalton. Because the mass of an electron is only about 1/2,000 that of a neutron or proton, we can ignore electrons when computing the total mass of an atom.</p><p class="Header3">Atomic Number and Atomic Weight</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Atoms of the various elements differ in their number of subatomic particles. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nuclei. This number of protons, which is unique to that element, is referred to as the <span class="Emphasis2">atomic number</span> and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol for the element. The abbreviation <SUB>2</SUB>He, for example, tells us that an atom of the element helium has 2 protons in its nucleus. Unless otherwise indicated, an atom is neutral in electrical charge, which means that its protons must be balanced by an equal number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">We can deduce the number of neutrons from a second quantity, the <span class="Emphasis2">mass number,</span> which is the sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number is written as a superscript to the left of an element’s symbol. For example, we can use this shorthand to write an atom of helium as <SUB>2</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>He. Because the atomic number indicates how many protons there are, we can determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number: A <SUB>2</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>He atom has 2 neutrons. An atom of sodium, <SUB>11</SUB><SUP>23</SUP>Na, has 11 protons, 11 electrons, and 12 neutrons. The simplest atom is hydrogen <SUP>1</SUP><SUB>1</SUB>H, which has no neutrons; it consists of a lone proton with a single electron moving around it.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Almost all of an atom’s mass is concentrated in its nucleus, because the contribution of electrons to mass is negligible. Because neutrons and protons each have a mass very close to 1 dalton, the mass number is an approximation of the total mass of an atom, usually called its <span class="Emphasis2">atomic weight.</span> So, we might say that the atomic weight of helium (<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>He) is 4 daltons, although more precisely it is 4.003 daltons.</p><p class="Header3">Isotopes</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, but some atoms have more neutrons than other atoms of the same element and therefore weigh more. These different atomic forms are referred to as <span class="Emphasis2">isotopes</span> of the element. In nature, an element occurs as a mixture of its isotopes. For example, consider the three isotopes of the element carbon, which has the atomic number 6. The most common isotope is carbon-12, <SUP>12</SUP><SUB>6</SUB>C, which accounts for about 99%  of the carbon in nature. It has 6 neutrons. Most of the remaining 1%  of carbon consists of atoms of the isotope <SUP>13</SUP><SUB>6</SUB>C, with 7 neutrons. A third, even rarer isotope, <SUP>14</SUP><SUB>6</SUB>C, has 8 neutrons. Notice that all three isotopes of carbon have 6 protons--otherwise, they would not be carbon. Although isotopes of an element have slightly different masses, they behave identically in chemical reactions. (The number usually given as the atomic weight of an element is actually an average of the atomic weights of all the element’s naturally occurring isotopes.)</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Both <SUP>12</SUP>C and <SUP>13</SUP>C are stable isotopes, meaning that their nuclei do not have a tendency to lose particles. The isotope <SUP>14</SUP>C, however, is unstable, or radioactive. A <span class="Emphasis2">radioactive isotope</span> is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, radioactive carbon decays to form nitrogen.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Radioactive isotopes have many useful applications in biology. In Chapter 25, you will learn how researchers use measurements of radioactivity in fossils to date those relics of past life. Radioactive isotopes are also useful as tracers to follow atoms through metabolism, the chemical processes of an organism. Cells use the radioactive atoms as they would nonradioactive isotopes of the same element, but the radioactive tracers can be readily detected. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.6</span> shows two methods biologists use to monitor radioactive tracers.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig2-6','../fig/big/fig2-6.jpg','fig2-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig2-6.jpg" alt="fig2-6" name="myfig2-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 2-6.</B>&nbsp;<span>Using radioactive isotopes to study cell chemistry. Scientists use radioactive isotopes to label certain chemical substances in order to follow a metabolic process or locate the substance within a cell or an organism. (a) This researcher is performing an experiment to determine how temperature affects the rate at which certain cells make new copies of their DNA. First, the cells are placed in a medium that includes the ingredients for making DNA. One ingredient is labeled with <SUP>3</SUP>H, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Any new DNA the cells make will incorporate <SUP>3</SUP>H. Separate samples of the cells in their radioactive medium are incubated at different temperatures. After an allotted amount of time, samples are taken from each culture and their DNA is tested for radioactivity in a device called a scintillation counter (shown here). The DNA samples are placed in vials containing a fluid that emits flashes of light whenever radiation from the decay of the <SUP>3</SUP>H tracer in the DNA excites chemicals in the fluid. The frequency of flashes, proportional to the amount of radioactive DNA present, is measured in counts per minute. When the counts for the various DNA samples are plotted against the temperature at which the cells were grown, as in the graph here, it is apparent that temperature dramatically affects the rate of DNA synthesis. This result might be useful to researchers studying the details of DNA synthesis. (b) A technique known as autoradiography can be used to locate the radioactively labeled DNA from part (a) within the cells. Thin slices of the cells are placed on glass slides and kept for some time in the dark covered by a layer of photographic emulsion. Radiation from the radioactive tracer present in any new DNA exposes the photographic emulsion, creating a pattern of black dots. In the photo, radioactive DNA in the cell on the left is clearly located in the cell’s nucleus.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Radioactive tracers are important diagnostic tools in medicine. For example, certain kidney disorders can be diagnosed by injecting small doses of substances containing radioactive isotopes into the blood and then measuring the amount of tracer excreted in the urine.

A PET scanner detects the energy released in these collisions and maps as "hot spots" the regions of an organ that are most chemically active at the time.

If the nucleus were the size of a golf ball, the electrons would be moving about the nucleus at an average distance of approximately 1 kilometer (km). Atoms are mostly empty space.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">When two atoms approach each other during a chemical reaction, their nuclei do not come close enough to interact. Of the three kinds of subatomic particles we have discussed, only electrons are directly involved in the chemical reactions between atoms.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">An atom’s electrons vary in the amount of energy they possess. <span class="Emphasis2">Energy</span> is defined as the ability to do work. <span class="Emphasis2">Potential energy</span> is the energy that matter stores because of its position or location. For example, because of its altitude, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy. When the gates of the reservoir’s dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy comes out of storage to do work, such as turning generators. Because potential energy has been expended, the water stores less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move to the lowest possible state of potential energy; in this example, water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">The electrons of an atom also have potential energy because of their position in relation to the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus; the more distant the electrons are from the nucleus, the greater their potential energy. Unlike the continuous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain discrete amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase. The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. An electron cannot exist in between its fixed states of potential energy.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText">The different states of potential energy that electrons have in an atom are called <span class="Emphasis2">energy levels,</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">electron shells</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.9</span>). The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the lowest energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, electrons in the third shell more energy still, and so on. An electron can change its shell, but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between the old shell and the new shell. To move to a shell farther out from the nucleus, the electron must absorb energy. For example, light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. (Indeed, this is the first step when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water.) To move to a shell closer to the nucleus, an electron must lose energy, which is usually released to the environment in the form of heat. For example, when sunlight excites electrons in the paint of a dark car roof to higher energy levels, the roof heats up as the electrons fall back to their original levels.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig2-9','../fig/big/fig2-9.jpg','fig2-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig2-9.jpg" alt="fig2-9" name="myfig2-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 2-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Energy levels of an atom’s electrons.</span> Electrons exist only at fixed levels of potential energy, which are also called electron shells.

Hydrogen’s 1 electron and helium’s 2 electrons are located in the first shell. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell (the lowest available shell). The outermost energy level occupied by electrons is called the valence shell.

Electrons, like all matter, tend to exist in the lowest available state of potential energy, which they have in the first shell. However, the first shell can hold no more than 2 electrons. An atom with more than 2 electrons must use higher shells because the first shell is full. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two of these electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell. The second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons. Neon, at the end of the second row, has 8 electrons in the second shell, giving it a total of 10 electrons.</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText">The chemical behavior of an atom depends mostly on the number of electrons in its <span class="Emphasis1">outermost</span> shell. We refer to those outer electrons as <span class="Emphasis2">valence electrons</span> and to the outermost electron shell as the <span class="Emphasis2">valence shell.</span> In the case of lithium, there is only 1 valence electron, and the second shell is the valence shell. Atoms with the same number of electrons in their valence shells exhibit similar chemical behavior. For example, fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) both have 7 valence electrons, and both combine with the element sodium to form compounds (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.2</span>). An atom with a completed valence shell is unreactive; that is, it will not interact readily with other atoms it encounters. At the far right of the periodic table are helium, neon, and argon, the only three elements shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.10</span> that have full valence shells.
