The nervous system, which we will study in Chapters 48 and 49, conveys high-speed signals along specialized cells called neurons. These rapid messages function in such activities as the movement of body parts in response to sudden environmental changes--jerking your hand away from a flame, for example.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Slower means of communication regulate other biological processes, such as the maturation of a butterfly. Different parts of the body must be informed how fast to grow and when to develop the characteristics that distinguish male from female or the juvenile from the adult of a species. This kind of information is often relayed by hormones.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Collectively, all of an animal’s hormone-secreting cells constitute the <span class="Emphasis2">endocrine system.</span> Hormone-secreting organs are called <span class="Emphasis2">endocrine glands,</span> also called ductless glands because they secrete their chemical messengers directly into body fluids. In contrast, <span class="Emphasis1">exocrine glands</span> secrete chemicals, such as sweat, mucus, and digestive enzymes, into ducts that convey the products to the appropriate locations.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Although it is convenient to distinguish between the endocrine and nervous systems, the lines between these two regulatory systems are blurred, and homeostasis depends heavily on overlap between them.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
