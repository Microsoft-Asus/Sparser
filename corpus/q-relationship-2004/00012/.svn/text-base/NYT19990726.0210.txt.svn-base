The crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island three years ago caused unimaginable heartache for thousands of people on both sides of the Atlantic and spawned enough conspiracy theories to keep paranoid conversations going late into the night .
The Boeing 747-100 went down on July 17 , 1996 , shortly after taking off from New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport bound for Paris .
Investigators have determined that the center fuel tank -- with vapors heated from air-conditioning packs running underneath the tank as the plane sat for three hours on the tarmac in New York -- exploded , killing all 230 people on board .
But they do not know what caused the vapors in the nearly empty tank to ignite .
It remains one of aviation 's great unsolved mysteries .
Anyone looking for the solution in Pat Milton 's `` In the Blink of an Eye '' will be disappointed .
In fact , anyone looking for anything other than praise for James Kallstrom , the special agent in charge of the FBI 's New York office and who led the criminal investigation into the accident , should take a pass on the book , subtitled appropriately enough , `` The FBI Investigation of TWA Flight 800 . ''
To be fair , Milton admits in her foreword that the book has no answers .
In fact , it does not even `` propose a theory of why Flight 800 exploded in the sky off Long Island . ''
Instead , it tells , in meticulous detail but too often in redundant fashion -LRB- at least four times in the first 100 pages we are told that the investigation was either the largest in FBI history , the most complex in FBI history , or both -RRB- how the FBI went about trying to prove negatives : that neither friendly fire nor an act of terrorism caused the crash .
There are two serious flaws in the book , neither of which are entirely Milton 's fault .
First , it is written as a police thriller , but there is no moment of good vanquishing evil , of clever law enforcement officials finding a way to nab the bad guy .
One longs for the type of ingenuity and bravado of FBI agents in other investigations mentioned by Milton .
When writing about agent Joe Cantamessa , for example , strolling through the press camp at East Moriches , N.Y. , in an effort to find out how the media was able to so quickly learn body counts -LRB- they were using scanners to monitor cell phone calls -RRB- she writes : `` His smooth talk and nothing-is-impossible attitude had enabled him to place a tiny microphone in Mafia boss Paul Castellano 's television set while bodyguards stood nearby .
Posing as a television repairman to fix a set made fuzzy by Kallstrom and his crew , Cantamessa invited the two thugs to look over his shoulder ` so you do n't think I 'm pulling anything funny here . '
'' Second , the massive loss of life and the initial reports that a missile or bomb probably brought down the plane were so traumatic to the nation that the basic details of the crash -LRB- and even some of the conspiracy theories -RRB- are well known to many Americans .
As a result , there are few surprises in this book .
Parts of the book , such as Kallstrom 's relationship with the family of a young boy -- one of 16 teenagers from Montoursville , Pa. , on the flight -- who dreamed of becoming an FBI agent , are well-written and moving .
Milton also does a very good job writing about the reaction of members of the investigation team upon seeing the reconstructed jet and its interior .
But Milton , a veteran Associated Press reporter based in New York who covered the crash , goes too far in describing some of the victims ' bodies .
The detail is neither moving nor relevant , but simply disgusting .
For the conspiracy theorist , the book may put to rest the assertion that a US military accident turned the jumbo jet into a fireball .
After numerous requests to the Pentagon , agents got a list of all military assets in the area .
Their positions were verified by radar and satellite images .
In the case of the USS Normandy , for example , which was 181 miles away from Flight 800 , agents got the serial numbers of all weapons loaded on the ship on July 16 and then boarded the ship and saw all the weapons on board , and matched the serial numbers , even though the Normandy was out of range to hit the airplane .
The book recounts similar painstaking efforts to determine if a bomb or a missile was responsible , and if any passenger or Kennedy Airport worker could have caused the crash .
For those looking for a good whodunit , there is little satisfaction , unfortunately , in reading again and again that evidence of one sort or another -LRB- or the lack of it in the form of pitting or petalling of the aluminum skin of the aircraft , which would indicate a bomb or missile -RRB- resulted in suspects being dropped and theories being abandoned .
Milton 's lauding of Kallstrom is so effusive that it borders on hero worship .
It not only strains credulity but also diminishes the man 's considerable accomplishments .
Consider the night of the crash , when National Security Council officials were huddled in Washington determining how best to respond to what seemed like a certain act of terrorism , and the FBI in New York was the lead investigative agency .
Should not the apparent threat to America , the loss of 230 innocent lives , be motivation enough for professionals charged with finding out what brought down the plane ?
Not for Milton , who writes : `` By the time Kallstrom strode in , the Command Post was up and running .
Some twenty-five agents were already at their stations .
The boss 's presence charged the room ; you could see the difference in the way the agents seemed to come to attention as he entered .
Kallstrom was a bear of a man brimming with fierce energy , whose sparkling green eyes invariably flashed the message : We 'll win , I promise . ''
In another part of the book , Milton states , `` Kallstrom was one of the few in the bureau with a thorough understanding of computer technology , '' a statement that defies logic , and , if true , indicates serious trouble for the war on crime .
The book does a good job of capturing Kallstrom 's indefatigable attempt to find the answer , and his battle with the National Transportation Safety Board to reconstruct the entire plane in order to be able to look for a telltale sign of a missile or bomb .
The NTSB was initially against the idea because they believed the cause to be mechanical and that reconstructing the plane would be too costly and labor intensive .
The book is factually inaccurate in many small points , which may be a minor irritation for some , and a reason for others to put it aside .
For example , it says : `` One 747-100 , exactly like Flight 800 , had been converted for use as Air Force One to carry the president . ''
The Air Force has two Boeing 747s for presidential transport , and both are 200B series models , which have more power and range than the 100 series .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Perhaps most startling , since the book spends much time discussing terrorism and aviation , is Milton 's assertion that `` the Libyan terrorists who downed Pan Am Flight 103 had chosen the front cargo hold . ''</ENAMEX>
That would be a nifty trick indeed , considering that the baggage that contained the bomb was checked in Malta on a different airline , and then transferred to Pan Am in Frankfurt for Flight 103 .
And when that flight got to London , there was another change of planes .
In all , the book seems more like the official FBI version of the accident and its investigation , blessed with the imprimatur of an objective journalist .
But Milton threw her objectivity to the wind .
After all , one of the main beneficiaries of the tragedy was the FBI itself , which saw its budget increased , the number of agents swell , and its powers grow , all as a result of the perceived terrorist threat in the wake of the Flight 800 .
Milton considered that fact worthy of one sentence .
