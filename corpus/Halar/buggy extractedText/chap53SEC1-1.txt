WHAT IS A COMMUNITY?

 

 Contrasting views of communities are rooted in the individualistic and interactive hypotheses



 

 The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models



A community is any assemblage of populations in an area or habitat. Ecologists define the boundaries of a particular community to fit their research questions. We might study the community of decomposers and other organisms in a rotting log, the benthic community in Lake Superior, or the community of trees and shrubs in Shenandoah National Park. A community has a set of properties defined by its species composition, with a structure determined by the interactions between the species. Communities differ dramatically in their species richness, the number of species that they contain. But some species are common and some are rare, and so communities also differ in their relative abundance of different species. What causes each community to have a certain assemblage of species? Two very different answers to this question have polarized community ecologists for over 50 years.
