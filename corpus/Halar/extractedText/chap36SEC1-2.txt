ABSORPTION OF WATER AND MINERALS BY ROOTS

 

 Root hairs, mycorrhizae, and a large surface area of cortical cells enhance water and mineral absorption



 

 The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue



Water and mineral salts from soil enter the plant through the epidermis of roots, cross the root cortex, pass into the stele, and then flow up xylem vessels to the shoot system. In this section, we focus on the soil  epidermis  root cortex  xylem segments of this transport pathway. Use FIGURE 36.7 to reinforce the key concepts as you read this section.

Fig 36-7. Lateral transport of minerals and water in roots. Minerals are absorbed from the soil solution by the root surface, especially by root hairs and mycorrhizae (symbiotic associations of roots and fungi, not shown in this diagram). The water and minerals then move across the root cortex to the stele by a combination of the apoplastic and symplastic routes (see FIGURE 36.6).
