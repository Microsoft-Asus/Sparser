Chapter 37: PLANT NUTRITION

NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF PLANTS

   The chemical composition of plants provides clues to their nutritional requirements

   Plants require nine macronutrients and at least eight micronutrients

   The symptoms of a mineral deficiency depend on the function and mobility of the element



THE ROLE OF SOIL IN PLANT NUTRITION

   Soil characteristics are key environmental factors in terrestrial ecosystems

   Soil conservation is one step toward sustainable agriculture



THE SPECIAL CASE OF NITROGEN AS A PLANT NUTRIENT

   The metabolism of soil bacteria makes nitrogen available to plants

   Improving the protein yield of crops is a major goal of agricultural research



NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS: SYMBIOSIS OF PLANTS AND SOIL MICROBES

   Symbiotic nitrogen fixation results from intricate interactions between roots and bacteria

   Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations of roots and fungi that enhance plant nutrition

   Mycorrhizae and root nodules may have an evolutionary relationship



NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS: PARASITISM AND PREDATION BY PLANTS

   Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants

   Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals

Every organism is an open system connected to its environment by a continuous exchange of energy and materials. In the energy flow and chemical cycling that keep an ecosystem alive, plants and other photosynthetic autotrophs perform the key step of transforming inorganic compounds into organic ones. Autotrophic does not mean autonomous, however. Plants need sunlight as the energy source for photosynthesis. And to synthesize organic matter, plants also require raw materials in the form of inorganic substances: carbon dioxide, water, and a variety of minerals present as inorganic ions in the soil. With its ramifying root system and shoot system (see the photograph of a hyacinth above), a plant is extensively networked with its environment--the soil and air, which are the reservoirs of the plant's inorganic nutrients. In this chapter, you will learn more about the nutritional requirements of plants and examine some of the structural and physiological adaptations for plant nutrition that have evolved.
