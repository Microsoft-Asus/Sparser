DNA REPLICATION AND REPAIR

 

 During DNA replication, base pairing enables existing DNA strands to serve as templates for new complementary strands



 

 A large team of enzymes and other proteins carries out DNA replication



 

 Enzymes proofread DNA during its replication and repair damage in existing DNA



 

 The ends of DNA molecules are replicated by a special mechanism



The relationship between structure and function, one of the themes of biology, is manifest in the double helix. The idea that there is specific pairing of nitrogenous bases in DNA was the flash of inspiration that led Watson and Crick to the correct double helix. At the same time, they saw the functional significance of the base-pairing rules. They ended their classic paper with this wry statement: "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." In the next section, you will learn about this basic mechanism of DNA replication. Some important details of the process will be presented in the section that follows.
