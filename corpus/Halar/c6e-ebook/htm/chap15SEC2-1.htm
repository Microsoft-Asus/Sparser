Then, around 1900, cytology and genetics converged as biologists began to see parallels between the behavior of chromosomes and the behavior of Mendel’s factors. For example, chromosomes and genes are both present in pairs in diploid cells, homologous chromosomes separate and alleles segregate during meiosis, and fertilization restores the paired condition for both chromosomes and genes. Around 1902, Walter S. Sutton, Theodor Boveri, and others independently noted these parallels, and a <span class="Emphasis2">chromosome theory of inheritance</span> began to take form. According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci on chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.1</span>, p. 270).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig15-1','../fig/big/fig15-1.jpg','fig15-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig15-1.jpg" alt="fig15-1" name="myfig15-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 15-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The chromosomal basis of Mendel’s laws.</span> Here we correlate the results of one of Mendel’s dihybrid crosses (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7b</span>) with the behavior of chromosomes.
