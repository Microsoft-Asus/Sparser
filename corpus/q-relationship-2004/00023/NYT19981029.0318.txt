GUSH KATIF , Gaza Strip --
A Palestinian suicide bomber , aiming for a bus full of Israeli schoolchildren , Thursday blew himself up outside a Jewish settlement here , killing one soldier and wounding seven other people .
None of the children was hurt .
Hours later , Palestinian police placed Sheik Ahmed Yassin , the spiritual leader of the militant Islamic organization Hamas , under house arrest after the group took responsibility for the bombing .
The Palestinians also arrested about 15 Hamas members and called in four other leaders of the organization for questioning .
The bombing , the first suicide attack in Israel in months , came six days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed a new peace agreement .
It 's implementation is scheduled to begin next week .
According to the army , the attack occurred about 7 : 30 a.m. as two jeeps full of soldiers were escorting a school bus carrying about 40 children of Jewish settlers into an Israeli -controlled part of the Gaza Strip .
When a car tried to drive alongside the bus , the lead jeep maneuvered in between , and in doing so , took the brunt of the explosion .
One soldier , identified as Alexei Neykov , 19 , was killed , and three other soldiers were wounded .
Three Palestinian girls were injured when the roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed .
`` If the soldiers had n't -LRB- moved in between the bus -RRB- , there could have been a situation where in every house there would have been a dead child , '' said Yossi Hadad , whose 6-year -old daughter , Cheli , was riding in a minivan behind the school bus .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's response to Thursday 's attack would be a `` test '' of the Palestinian commitment to fight terror as agreed in the new accord negotiated at the Wye River conference center in Maryland .
`` I told him that the test will be the absolute enlistment of the Palestinian Authority against terrorists , '' Netanyahu said .
`` He told me he had just emerged from a meeting with his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that spirit .
`` If -LRB- he -RRB- meets -LRB- his -RRB- obligation , we will carry out ours , '' Netanyahu said .
`` I hope they will meet the test successfully . ''
The Israelis pledged to hand over an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in return for specific Palestinian steps to combat terrorism .
The accord sparked violent protests by settlers and their supporters , the apparent tit-for-tat killings in the West Bank of a settler and a Palestinian .
Arafat condemned Thursday 's attack and said that the perpetrators would be tried for `` deliberately harming the Palestinians ' national interests . ''
`` We will exert all effort to disclose who stood behind this terrorist act which was directed against the schoolchildren , '' Arafat said .
The bombing made Netanyahu 's task of convincing his hard-line coalition partners to back the Wye agreement a notch more difficult , analysts said .
On Sunday , he returned to Israel to find widespread opposition to the deal from several members of his Cabinet and Likud Party .
Protests were held at his red-carpet welcoming ceremony and across the West Bank .
One coalition member , the National Religious Party , withdrew its support for the prime minister and worked with the opposition Labor Party to write a proposed law that would bring about new elections .
Netanyahu has postponed a Cabinet vote to ratify the Wye agreement but Thursday 's attack did not appear to disrupt the timetable for implementation of the deal .
He fell short of suggesting that the attack would delay implementation , set to begin on Nov. 2 .
In Washington , President Clinton suggested the bombing should not deter peace .
`` I think the important thing is they all made commitments to do certain things on a certain timetable , and no one should step off of that , '' Clinton said .
Hamas has threatened to block any Palestinian - Israeli peace , and it has launched suicide attacks that have killed dozens of Israelis .
Its attacks have paralyzed peace negotiations and helped pave the way for Netanyahu 's election .
Thursday 's attack suggested that Hamas ' military wing may be more active and organized that previously thought , analysts said .
Recent attacks carried out by the group have been limited to individual stabbings and grenade throwing , a possible sign that the militants were failing to carry out larger operations .
Shortly after Thursday 's attack , the Palestinian Authority arrested 15 suspected Hamas members from Khan Younis , the Palestinian town closest to the Gush Katif settlement where Thursday 's bombing occurred .
Then , the Palestinians put Sheikh Yassin , the group 's 61-year -old wheelchair-bound founder , under house arrest .
Yassin denied knowledge of the bombing , but a caller to Israel Radio , claiming to be from Hamas , said the organization was responsible for what he termed a `` wonderful operation . ''
`` It 's a revolution until victory , '' the caller said .
The development was a surprising move by Arafat because he has seemed to bend over backwards to avoid a confrontation with Yassin , a rival for the leadership of the Palestinian people .
Israeli police said they had not yet identified the bomber , whose charred body was found near the wreckage .
By midafternoon , dozens of Israeli soldiers , investigators and bomb experts milled around the burned-out remains of the school bus .
Palestinians living in aluminum shacks nearby passed by on donkey carts .
Most of the children had been taken home or to school .
David Giber , a 14-year -old who had been on the bus , said he was more angry than scared after the bombing happened .
`` The Palestinians are not holding to their part of the agreement , '' he said , riding his bike through the nearby settlement of Ganei Tal. Yossi Hadad , whose daughter was in the minivan behind the bus , said he heard the explosion and ran to the scene to help .
`` My girl , she saw the -LRB- bus -RRB- driver with blood on his face and she was upset and crying , '' he said .
`` I took her , and we went and ate some ice cream , and then I took her to the zoo .
Then I took her to school . ''
Hadad , echoing many of the 5,000 settlers here , said he did not foresee an end to violence , even if peace agreements were implemented .
`` There were things like this before the agreement , '' he said .
`` There will be again . ''
