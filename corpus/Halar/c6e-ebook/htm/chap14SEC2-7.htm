As much information as possible is collected about a family’s history for a particular trait, and this information is assembled into a family tree describing the interrelationships of parents and children across the generations--the family <span class="Emphasis2">pedigree.</span> A simple example of a pedigree appears in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.14a</span>, which traces the occurrence of widow’s peak (a pointed contour of the hairline on the forehead). The trait is due to a dominant allele, which we symbolize as <span class="Emphasis1">W.</span></p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig14-14','../fig/big/fig14-14.jpg','fig14-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig14-14.jpg" alt="fig14-14" name="myfig14-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 14-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Pedigree analysis.</span> In these family trees, squares symbolize males and circles represent females.

We also know that both grandparents with widow’s peaks are heterozygous (<span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>); if they were homozygous dominant (<span class="Emphasis1">WW</span>), then all of their offspring would have widow’s peaks. The offspring in this second generation who <span class="Emphasis1">do</span> have widow’s peaks must also be heterozygous, because they are the products of <span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>&#160;X&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">ww</span> matings. The third generation in this pedigree consists of two sisters. The one who has a widow’s peak could be either homozygous (<span class="Emphasis1">WW</span>) or heterozygous (<span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>), given what we know about the genotypes of her parents (both <span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.14b</span> is a pedigree of the same family, but this time we focus on a recessive trait, attached earlobes. We’ll use <span class="Emphasis1">f</span> for the recessive allele and <span class="Emphasis1">F</span> for the dominant allele, which results in free earlobes. As you work your way through the pedigree, notice once again that you can apply what you have learned about Mendelian inheritance to fill in the genotypes for most individuals. (As you may have already guessed, the ears shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.14b</span> do not actually belong to the women shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.14a</span>. However, their earlobes would resemble those in the photographs.)</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">A pedigree not only helps us understand the past; it also helps us predict the future. Suppose that the couple represented in the second generation of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.14</span> decide to have one more child. What is the probability that the child will have a widow’s peak? This is a Mendelian F<SUB>1</SUB> cross (<span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>&#160;X&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">Ww</span>), and thus the probability that a child will exhibit the dominant phenotype (widow’s peak) is 3/4. What is the probability that the child will have attached earlobes? Again, we can treat this as a monohybrid cross (<span class="Emphasis1">Ff</span>&#160;X&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">Ff</span>), but this time we want to know the chance that the offspring will be homozygous recessive. The probability is 1/4. What is the chance that the child will have a widow’s peak <span class="Emphasis1">and</span> attached earlobes? If the two pairs of alleles assort independently in this dihybrid problem (<span class="Emphasis1">WwFf</span>&#160;X&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">WwFf</span>), then we can use the rule of multiplication: 3/4 (chance of widow’s peak) &#160;X&#160; 1/4 (chance of attached earlobes) = 3/16 (chance of widow’s peak and attached earlobes).</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
