Chapter 11 discussed the discovery that the hormone epinephrine exerts its effects via membrane receptors. Another dramatic example of the role of membrane receptors involves changes in frog skin color, an adaptation that helps camouflage the frog as lighting changes. The darkness of the skin varies with the organelle arrangement within melanocytes, skin cells that contain the dark brown pigment melanin in cytoplasmic organelles called melanosomes. The frog’s skin appears light when the melanosomes are clustered tightly around the cell nuclei and darker when the melanosomes spread throughout the cytoplasm. The arrangement of melanosomes is controlled by a peptide hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), secreted by the pituitary gland. When MSH is added to the interstitial fluid surrounding the pigment-containing cells, the melanosomes disperse. However, direct microinjection of MSH into individual melanocytes does not induce melanosome dispersion--evidence that interaction between the hormone and a <span class="Emphasis1">surface</span> receptor is required for hormone action.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">A signal receptor located in the plasma membrane is generally the first component of a <span class="Emphasis2">signal-transduction pathway,</span> a series of molecular changes that converts an extracellular chemical signal to a specific intracellular response. You may wish to review the molecules and mechanisms of cell signaling in Chapter 11. Depending on the signal molecule and the molecules present in a target cell, a signal-transduction pathway may lead to responses in either the cytoplasm (the activation of an enzyme, for instance) or the nucleus (usually involving the regulation of specific genes). And because different types of cells have different collections of molecules (especially proteins), the same signal can bring about different responses in different target cells (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.4</span>). Hormones are especially potent regulators, effective in minute amounts, and signal-transduction pathways can trigger elaborate enzyme cascades that amplify the hormonal signal (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.16</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig45-4','../fig/big/fig45-4.jpg','fig45-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig45-4.jpg" alt="fig45-4" name="myfig45-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 45-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">One chemical signal, different effects.</span> A single type of signal molecule, in this case a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, can produce different responses in different target cells.
