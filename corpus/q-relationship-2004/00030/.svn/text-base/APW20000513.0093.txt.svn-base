WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Gun control legislation is stalled in Congress and prospects for action appear dim in an election year .
While another shooting tragedy could spur action , the National Rifle Association 's influence has won out so far .
Organizers of Sunday 's `` Million Mom March '' plan to transform their movement into a political operation to compete with the NRA -- not financially , but by using the Internet to stay connected and convince supporters to vote for candidates who back gun control .
The Senate approved several measures a year ago , including a requirement that weapons have child safety locks .
The Senate also would require a three-day waiting period before a sale by an unlicensed gun seller at a gun show .
The same time frame is currently required for licensed dealer sales at shows and in stores .
The Senate also approved language that would ban the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips ; ban possession of firearms by those convicted of committing violent crimes as juveniles , and prohibit juveniles from acquiring assault weapons .
The House rejected any new controls and there are no scheduled meetings between House and Senate conferees .
The Clinton administration strongly supports the safety locks and waiting period language and has criticized the failure of conferees to meet to fashion a compromise .
The NRA and its supporters argue there are plenty of gun regulations now but the administration has not been enforcing them .
The `` Million Mom March '' organizers want further restrictions beyond the Senate -approved measures .
Chief among them is the registration of all handguns and a license for their owners .
The licensing system would require purchasers to receive basic safety training and is designed to prevent sales to criminals , children or disturbed individuals .
Guns would be registered after sellers checked the buyer 's license and then registered the gun 's serial number .
