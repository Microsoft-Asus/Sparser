WASHINGTON , September 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S. researchers created the first reliable test for mad cow disease and its human counterpart , The Wall Street Journal reported the discovery that could help prevent the spread of the deadly brain disorders .
It is n't known when commercial versions of the test , which was developed by scientists at California Institute of Technology and the National Institutes of Health , will be available , the paper said .
However , the test which uses antibodies to detect the presence of a characteristic protein found in the spinal fluid of those with the diseases , is simple enough to be performed now by any well-equipped public health laboratory , the paper quoted one researcher as saying .
In humans , the experimental test could allow doctors to detect the presence while patients are still alive of so-called Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , which has symptoms similar to Alzheimer 's disease .
Previously , the disease could only be verified through a brain biopsy after death .
Scientists could also use the test in the future to see whether cows or other animals with brain disorders actually have mad cow disease , or just a noncontagious disorder with similar symptoms .
Currently , one-third of animals slaughtered because they are suspected of having mad cow disease turn out not to have the disease .
The paper also mentioned that the test is far from perfect .
For example , it can only detect the disease in animals or humans that have developed symptoms , even though it is believed that humans and animals may be infected for many years without any signs .
Moreover , the researchers are still verifying whether the test works for different variants of mad cow disease , including a particular English strain .
They expect to have these results in several months .
