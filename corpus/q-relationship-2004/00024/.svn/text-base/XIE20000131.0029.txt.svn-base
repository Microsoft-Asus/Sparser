ATHENS , January 31 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Greece said Monday that a 1988 memorandum signed between Greece and Turkey on building confidence can be a good basis for further rapprochement between the two neighboring countries .
Speaking at a press briefing , Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Greece wants rapprochement between the two neighbors to be dealt with in `` a positive spirit and strong will '' from both countries , adding that a good basis to use to achieve positive results in this sector is the memorandum signed between the then foreign ministers of the two countries in 1988 .
The 1988 memorandum outlines a broad framework of agreed rules of behavior regarding national military activities in the high seas and international airspace aimed at reducing tension and avoiding incidents between Greece and Turkey .
For decades , Greece and Turkey , both NATO members , have closely gone to war three times over their territorial disputes in the eastern Aegean Sea and the division problem of Cyprus .
The two neighbors have since last June taken effective steps to improve their strained relations , with the holding of `` low-level '' talks in Ankara and Athens between the two countries .
Recently , Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou has paid an official three-day visit to Turkey , the first by a Greek foreign minister since 1962 , and signed with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem four agreements for bilateral cooperation on tourism , investment , security and the environment .
Cem is also expected to visit Greece late this week to sign with Papandreou a series of bilateral agreements .
