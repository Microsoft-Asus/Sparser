MEXICO CITY --
Mexico 's center-right opposition party chalked up major election gains during the early 1990s but has lost momentum recently as a result of squabbles between the party 's doctrinaire conservatives and a new generation of more pragmatic politicians .
Now that may change .
Late Saturday , the party , National Action , elected a new party president , Sen. Luis Felipe Bravo Mena .
Analysts described him as a conciliator , with cordial ties to the party 's old guard as well as excellent relations with the campaign of Vicente Fox Quesada , a former Coca - Cola executive from the party 's younger , more pragmatic wing who has been campaigning since last year for the party 's presidential nomination .
Bravo 's credentials could help him attempt to unite the party behind Fox 's candidacy , which would be an important development as the race takes shape for the presidential election in July 2000 .
Much of the infighting has centered on whether the party , known by its Spanish initials , PAN , should support Fox , the governor of Guanajuato state , for the presidency .
Fox is building such force in national polls that he is an early front-runner .
But some of the party 's traditional leaders , including several descendants of the Roman Catholic politicians who founded the party in 1938 , have been quietly undercutting Fox .
`` Bravo is a bridging figure , '' said Federico Estevez , a political scientist .
`` He 's an intellectual who 's close in temperament to the PAN 's old guard , but who knows that his function must be to put the party at Fox 's disposition .
He 'll make sure that the party will dovetail smoothly with the Fox campaign . ''
Bravo faced his first major political decision minutes after he was sworn in late Saturday at a party convention in a Mexico City hotel .
Reporters pressed him for his position on recent proposals by several opposition politicians , including some old-guard leaders of his party , to support a common opposition candidate with the main leftist party to run next year against President Ernesto Zedillo 's governing party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party .
Bravo was noncommittal .
Several Mexican newspapers interpreted his remarks as an endorsement of the initiative to form an opposition alliance , but he said only that he would organize a serious discussion within his party of these proposals , which have dominated politics here in recent days .
In recent interviews , he has stressed the legal , ideological and practical obstacles to uniting the opposition behind a single candidate .
Several analysts said the proposal for an opposition alliance appeared to be , at least in part , an attempt by Fox 's rivals to undercut his candidacy .
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , Mexico City 's leftist mayor , who is a likely presidential candidate himself but is slumping in the polls , has endorsed the proposals and suggested that Fox should slow his campaign to negotiate rules that could govern the opposition alliance .
And on Friday , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , National Action 's presidential candidate in 1994 , who is perhaps Fox 's greatest rival within the party , floated a new idea , urging opposition parties to unite around an alliance candidate with no ties to any of the major parties .
Fox called Fernandez 's proposal `` a joke . ''
`` Diego is in the habit of saying strange things to capture the media 's attention , '' Fox said on Saturday .
