<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Japanese boats may now fish in disputed waters off Russia 's east coast under a bilateral agreement that went into effect Thursday .
The agreement , signed in February , allows Japanese boats to fish off southern islands in the Kuril chain , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .</ENAMEX>
Previously , Japanese boats fishing in the disputed waters risked being fired at by Russian patrol boats and having their crews arrested .
The Kuril Islands are at the heart of a dispute that has kept Russia and Japan from signing an official peace treaty ending World War II .
Both countries claim the islands , which the Soviet army occupied at the end of the war .
Though the question of ownership is still not settled , Russian leaders hoped the fishing agreement would `` be an example of how we can cooperate in a civilized way without going against political positions , '' said Alexander Posyukov , head of the Foreign Ministry 's Japan department , ITAR - Tass reported .
He said the agreement , aimed at curbing poaching in the waters , allows Japanese boats to harvest a certain quota of fish in exchange for `` relevant compensation '' to Russia , ITAR - Tass said , providing no further details .
Relations between Russia and Japan have improved in the last year , following two summits between President Boris Yeltsin and former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto .
Russia and Japan have promised to sign a final World War II treaty and fully normalize relations by 2000 .
