THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PROKARYOTES

 

 Prokaryotes are indispensable links in the recycling of chemical elements in ecosystems



 

 Many prokaryotes are symbiotic



 

 Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases



 

 Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology



One of the themes of this unit is changing life on a changing planet--the relationship between geologic history and evolving biological forms. Organisms as pervasive, abundant, and diverse as the prokaryotes have had a tremendous impact on Earth and all its inhabitants.
