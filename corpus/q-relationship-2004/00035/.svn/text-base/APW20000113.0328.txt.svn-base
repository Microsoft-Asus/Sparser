WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Pentagon on Thursday ordered home a U.S. troop ship en route to Venezuela to help with flood recovery after Venezuela 's president said he did not want American soldiers in his country .
A second shipload of U.S. soldiers and equipment already held back at a North Carolina port while Washington sought to clarify President Hugo Chavez 's comments will not deploy , Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said .
Chavez 's government requested the aid in late December , and the USS Tortuga had left for Venezuela with bulldozers , tractors and engineering equipment .
But on Wednesday , Chavez said he would accept U.S. equipment -- without the troops the Pentagon said were needed to handle the machinery .
The ship had been slowing down while the USS Nashville had not left Moorhead City , N.C. `` Well , we were surprised by the reported comments , '' said Bacon , indicating that U.S. officials had not heard directly from Chavez 's government on the matter .
Chavez told reporters Wednesday that while Venezuela still needs more money , equipment and other materials , additional relief workers are unnecessary .
`` I want to clarify before Venezuela and the world that North American troops are not going to come to Venezuela , '' Chavez said .
`` If they want to send machines or other types of equipment we are open to that , and we are very thankful for the intention to help . ''
Bacon said U.S. equipment cannot be supplied without people to run it , maintain it and bring it back home after the work is done .
The 450 U.S. Marine and Navy engineers set to deploy were going to help rebuild a coastal road damaged by Dec. 15 flooding that killed thousands of Venezuelans .
They were expected to work in Venezuela for two months or more .
`` Clearly , if they do n't want the help , we wo n't provide it , '' Bacon said .
At the State Department , spokesman James P. Rubin cited a Dec. 24 letter in which Venezuela 's defense minister `` specifically requested the assistance of U.S. military engineers to open up a humanitarian corridor for flood-ravaged coastal communities . ''
Rubin said the deployment was authorized after close coordination with Venezuelan authorities and as part of a $ 25 million U.S. aid package .
Chavez 's government earlier welcomed U.S. help , including about 120 soldiers operating water purification facilities , Blackhawk helicopters , C -130 cargo planes and a C -5 Galaxy cargo plane .
Bacon said the United States would continue to support relief efforts with four helicopters and water purification units .
Chavez , a former army paratrooper elected a year ago , has been accused by opponents of using the floods and killer mudslides to consolidate his power , eliminating Congress , replacing the Supreme Court and hand-picking top judicial officials .
Chavez 's backers say he is merely taking steps mandated in his election victory to crush a corrupt oligarchy and help the nation 's poor .

He earlier refused to allow U.S. planes to fly over Venezuela in anti-narcotics operations .
