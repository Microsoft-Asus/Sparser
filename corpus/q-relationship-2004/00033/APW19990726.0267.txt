SINGAPORE
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Foreign ministers from Asia and the United States agreed today to urge North Korea not to launch another test missile , saying it would threaten regional security , a Japanese official said .
Before arriving at Asia 's annual security conference , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Korean peninsula `` perhaps the most dangerous place on earth today . ''
If North Korea launches a test missile , as analysts say the Pyongyang government is preparing to do , it would have `` a negative impact on regional security , '' said Japanese government spokesman Yasuhisa Kawamura .
Last August , North Korea launched a three-stage rocket that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean .
Another missile launch would make it difficult for Japan to continue financial support for a $ 1 billion North Korean nuclear energy project , Kawamura said .
That project was planned to dissuade North Korea from developing its own nuclear programs .
The ministers also agreed that a six-nation dispute over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea is `` not an immediate threat '' but requires attention , said Kawamura .
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations , which is hosting the annual regional forum , is preparing a code of conduct for the governments that claim portions of the islands , believed to be rich in minerals and oil .
The third major topic of discussion today was East Timor .
Albright expressed concern about recent violence in the Indonesian territory , saying it threatened to prevent a fair vote on independence for the former Portuguese colony from taking place as scheduled next month .
`` We look to the Indonesian government to meet its obligation to create a secure and credible environment for the August vote , '' Albright said .
In separate talks during the forum , the United States and China remained at odds over NATO 's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade , Albright said .
But she said she and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan agreed a crisis over Taiwan 's recent claim of statehood must be resolved quickly .
China has expressed indignation over Taiwanese President Lee Teng -hui 's recent suggestion that there should be `` state-to-state '' relations .
Lee 's comments appeared to undermine the so-called `` one- China '' policy , under which the mainland and Taiwan have long coexisted .
Tang refused to rule out force as an option and cautioned the United States to avoid doing anything that would `` fan the flames '' of Taiwanese independence .
U.S. law requires Washington to sell Taiwan defensive weapons and treat threats against the island as a matter of grave concern , although it is vague on whether U.S. forces would help defend the island .
`` If there occurs any action for Taiwan independence and any attempt by foreign forces to separate Taiwan from the motherland , the Chinese government and people will not sit back and do nothing , '' Tang said .
Albright said the stakes in a territorial dispute over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea were too high for the United States to sit on the sidelines and watch tensions rise .
But Malaysia and China said the dispute concerns only the six governments that claim the islands and should not be discussed by all 20 countries attending the ASEAN Regional Forum .
The islands are considered particularly valuable because they straddle vital sea routes and fishing areas .
Asian financial problems and help for the poor were also on the agenda .
Other issues included human rights abuses and drug smuggling in Myanmar , an ASEAN member , and continuing strife along the India - Pakistan border .
ASEAN consists of Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Thailand , Singapore and Vietnam .
They meet annually in the ASEAN Regional Forum with the United States , Russia , China , Japan , Australia , Canada , the European Union , South Korea , India , New Zealand and Mongolia .
