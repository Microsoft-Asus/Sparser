A former member of a Japanese doomsday cult was sentenced to 17 years in prison Friday for his role in the murder of seven people in a central Japanese city , a court official said .
Takashi Tomita , 40 , was sentenced for his involvement in the June 27 , 1994 , nerve gas attack by the Aum Shinri Kyo cult against a dormitory for court officials in the city of Matsumoto .
Seven died in the attack and 144 others were injured .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Tomita was also sentenced for his involvement in the mass production of the deadly sarin nerve gas at the cult 's compound at the foot of Mount Fuji </ENAMEX>.
Aum members have admitted using the gas in an attack on Tokyo subways in March 1995 that killed 12 , sickened thousands and shocked a nation that had taken its low crime rate for granted .
Friday 's ruling was the first convicted in connection with the 1994 attack .
Six other cult members , including its guru Shoko Asahara , still stand trial .
Presiding Tokyo District Court judge Toshikazu Ohbuchi told the court that Tomita committed the `` cruel crime '' in conspiring with Asahara .
In previous court sessions , Tomita admitted that he drove a vehicle equipped with a nerve-gas spraying device to the scene , but he insisted he did not know that the gas was lethal .
The prosecution told the court that Tomita had been told by other cult members of the deadly gas before the attack .
Cult guru Asahara , 43 , is being tried separately on charges of masterminding the subway attack , the attack in Matsumoto and dozens of other crimes , apparently part of his plan for a global war that would leave him ruler of the world .
Last month , a cult doctor was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the Tokyo subway attack .
The cult also has been implicated in the near-fatal shooting of Japan 's top police official and the deaths of a lawyer and his two family members .
More than 100 members have already been convicted on various lesser charges .
The cult has been legally disbanded , but local news media have reported some members still meet .
