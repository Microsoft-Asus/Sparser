									<a name="para102"></a><p class="BlockText">Neurons fire in an all-or-none event. This on/off signaling is an evolutionary adaptation of animals that must sense and act in a complex environment. It is possible to imagine a nervous system in which the action potentials were graded, with the amplitude depending on the size of the stimulus. What advantage does on/off signaling have over a graded (continuously variable) kind of signaling?</p>

									<a name="para106"></a><p class="BlockText">Alcohol’s depressant effects on the nervous system cloud judgment and slow reflexes. Alcohol consumption is a factor in most fatal traffic accidents in the United States. What are some other impacts of alcohol abuse on society? What are some of the responses of people and society to alcohol abuse? Do you think this is primarily an individual or societal problem? Do you think our responses to alcohol abuse are appropriate and proportional to the seriousness of the problem? Defend your position.</p>
