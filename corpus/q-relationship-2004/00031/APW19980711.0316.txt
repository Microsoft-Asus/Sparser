AMMAN , Jordan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Jordan signed a global land mine treaty Saturday , joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact barring use , production and stockpiling of the weapon .
Queen Noor , King Hussein 's American -born wife , made the announcement to more than 250 people from more than 20 countries gathered for a conference on land mines .
Delegates to the two-day meeting were discussing ways of assisting mine victims in the Middle East .
It was hosted by the Landmine Survivors Network , a private organization based in Washington , D.C. The Ottawa convention , reached in Canada in December , has been signed by 127 nations .
Only 10 countries have ratified the treaty , which prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transferring of anti-personnel mines .
In her 30-minute address , Noor said Jordan needs technical assistance and equipment to clear the 185,000 mines in its territory , the bulk of them planted along the border with Israel since the 1967 Middle East war .
Jordan has cleared 65,000 mines in the last five years , but its efforts have been slow , apparently because of the lack of equipment , said Jerry White , executive director of the Landmine Survivors Network .
