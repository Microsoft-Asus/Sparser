Zhou Nan said that , according to the provisions of the Basic Law , the Chinese government will implement the principles of `` one country , two systems '' , `` Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong '' and high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong after 1997 .
In the meantime , he said , the central government will be responsible for Hong Kong 's defense and foreign affairs .
It has always been cautious and earnest about formulating the law and acts in strict accordance with the principled stipulations prescribed in the Basic Law on stationing troops in Hong Kong .
Zhou said that the entire process of drafting the law symbolizes the principle of safeguarding state sovereignty and brings democracy into full play .
When asked about the difference between the Garrison Law for the Hong Kong SAR and that for the British army , Zhou said that the biggest difference is that expenditures of the British army are paid for by Hong Kong residents while those of the PLA in Hong Kong are the responsibility of the central government .
`` I am certain that the PLA troops will study every provision of the law , and Hong Kong residents are welcome to cooperate with the troops and seeing that their actions are in accordance with the law , '' he said .
