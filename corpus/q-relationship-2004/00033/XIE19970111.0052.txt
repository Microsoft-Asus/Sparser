UNITED NATIONS , January 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- As the Security Council is prepared to have another round of consultations on sending military observers to Guatemala , Chinese U.N. envoy Qin Huasun warned Guatemala on Friday morning against any misjudgement of China 's positions and determination .
In a meeting with President of the Security Council Hisashi Owada of Japan , Ambassador Qin said that although China had given Guatemala opportunities to correct its mistakes committed on the issue of Taiwan , up to now they had failed to acknowledge and correct them .
`` The Guatemalan side still hold illusions with regards to Chinese positions , '' said Ambassador Qin .
`` There is definitely no way out if they continue acting like this . ''
`` We still hope the question can be solved in a proper way , '' Qin said .
`` But if requested before Guatemala can remove the obstacles , China is also ready to take part in a voting of the draft resolution , '' hinting that he may exercise veto power that China has not used since the end of Cold War .
In elaborating Chinese positions on the issue , Qin said that China has always supported the peace process of Guatemala .
The Chinese delegation has no objection to the draft resolution itself on sending military observers to Guatemala .
However , he said , the actions of Guatemala in the U.N. have violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China by supporting the admittance of Taiwan into the world body .
That has damaged the basis of cooperation between China and Guatemala and created barriers for China to support sending the military observers .
He stressed that only when Guatemala recognizes its mistakes and takes specific measures to correct them can the issue be solved .
The idea of sending 155 military observers to Guatemala was raised by both the former secretary-general Boutros Boutros - Ghali and friends of Guatemalan peace process , the United States , Spain , Sweden , Mexico and Venezuela .
The government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca -LRB- URNG -RRB- signed a final peace agreement on December 29 , 1996 .
But the government , ignoring China 's repeated warnings , invited the `` foreign minister '' of Taiwan to attend the signing ceremony .
