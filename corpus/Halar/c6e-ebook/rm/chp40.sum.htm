Some epithelia are specialized for absorption and secretion. The mucus secreted by the mucous membranes lining the digestive and respiratory tracts lubricates and moistens these surfaces.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Connective tissues bind and support other tissues. Loose connective tissue, the body’s binding and packing material, consists of fibroblasts and macrophages interspersed among collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers. Adipose (fat) tissue is a specialized type of loose connective tissue. Fibrous connective tissue, found in tendons and ligaments, is made of dense, parallel bundles of collagenous fibers. Cartilage is a strong yet flexible support material consisting of collagenous fibers in a rubbery foundation secreted by chondrocytes. The hard substance of bone is secreted by cells called osteoblasts. Blood is also a connective tissue.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">Neurons, the functional units of nervous tissue, are composed of a cell body with extending dendrites and axons that transmit electrical signals called impulses.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">Muscle tissue is composed of long cells (muscle fibers) containing parallel fibrils of contractile proteins. The three types of muscle tissue in vertebrates are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles, which differ in shape, striation, and nervous control.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity40A:<span class="Emphasis1">
