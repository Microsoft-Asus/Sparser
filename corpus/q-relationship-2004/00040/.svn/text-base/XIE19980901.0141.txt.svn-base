CANBERRA , September 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Australia stepped up its effort Tuesday for new talks with Japan in a bid to resolve the long-running tuna dispute between the two countries .
Australian Federal Resources Minister Warwick Parer said Australia had told Japan in a diplomatic note that it believed Japan 's experimental fishing program breached the international law .
The program , which ended Monday , involved Japan catching an extra 1,400 tons of Southern Bluefin Tuna -LRB- SBT -RRB- , a highly migratory fish that spawns in the Indian Ocean , over its previous 6,065 ton quota .
Australia , Japan and New Zealand are the founding members of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna , an organization that sets a total allowable catch and national allocations for its member countries .
Japanese officials argue the program will help assess tuna stocks .
But in a strongly worded statement , Parer said Japan only had itself to blame if critics accused it of using the experiment as a vehicle for a de facto quota increase .
Australia believed the program was inconsistent under customary international law , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna .
And Japan appeared intent on repeating the program next year and possibly beyond .
`` Our efforts to resolve the dispute are therefore directed at ensuring this kind of program is not repeated and that appropriate remedial action is taken with respect to the impact of this year 's fishing , '' Parer said in a statement .
`` As a first step we are seeking Japan 's agreement to negotiations -LRB- under the SBT Convention -RRB- , aimed at resolving the dispute within 30 days - given the importance of this matter , we urge Japan to join us at the negotiating table as a matter of urgency . ''
The dispute between Japan and Australia has already seen Australia ban Japanese tuna boats earlier this year from fishing in Australia 's Exclusive Economic Zone and Australian ports , except in emergencies .
