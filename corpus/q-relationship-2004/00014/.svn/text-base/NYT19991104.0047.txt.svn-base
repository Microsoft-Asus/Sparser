OVERLAND PARK , Kan. --
Is Romel Abufakher , the Overland Park businessman charged with killing his wife , also the mystery man who stopped potentially bloody terrorist attacks during the Gulf War with Iraq ?
The U.S. government is n't saying , but Abufakher and his attorneys are .
In an effort to get Abufakher 's $ 1 million bond lowered , attorney Tom Bath has filed information in Johnson County District Court describing Abufakher 's claim of 1991 life-risking exploits .
Included is one government agent 's statement to Abufakher 's attorneys that they say confirms he is the individual described on several U.S. State Department Web sites who was `` essential in thwarting the planned terror attacks . ''
`` Had the planned attacks succeeded , scores of Americans and citizens of our coalition partners would have been murdered , '' Brad Smith , the director of a State Department anti-terrorism program , is quoted as saying on one government Web site .
Abufakher , a real estate agent , broker and developer , has been jailed since Sept. 21 , charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of his wife , Carol Ann Abufakher .
Bath will argue for a lower bond at a hearing scheduled for Thursday .
The State Department and other U.S. government agencies would not confirm Abufakher 's claims .
At an earlier hearing , District Attorney Paul Morrison opposed any reduction in bond , in part because of Abufakher 's history of relocating .
Earlier , Morrison said his office had not been able to verify Abufakher 's claims .
Abufakher has lived elsewhere in the United States , including Tampa , Fla .
According to court records , Abufakher was a victim in a domestic battery case filed against his wife two years ago .
Abufakher had been charged in another Florida battery case involving a teen-age son , court records show .
Court records show both Abufakher and his wife entered probationary programs .
In September , Abufakher was being investigated by the state attorney general after Linn County , Kan. , property owners complained that he was trying to take their land for $ 200 .
Besides the Gulf War details , Bath also has filed information that he says supports Abufakher 's claim that his wife was accidentally shot and that he had summoned police help several times previously because she was acting violently and irrationally .
Police say a tape recorder he was carrying in his pocket captured the sounds of the shooting , including Abufakher 's statement to his wife , `` I 'm going to kill you . ''
Prosecutors say that is strong evidence of premeditation .
According to court documents , Abufakher , 47 , was born in Jordan , where he attended high school and college .
He followed other family members into the real estate business .
He moved to Bangkok , Thailand , in the late 1980s and was there in 1990 and 1991 when the Gulf War began .
Among the properties he owned were two houses rented by Iraqi diplomats , according to court documents .
Abufakher said he learned of potential terrorist activity and notified U.S. officials , who asked him to steal documents and plans from the houses .
The State Department acknowledges that an individual living in an `` east Asian '' country provided valuable information at the start of the Gulf War about pending Iraqi -sponsored attacks .
That east Asian case is referred to on several State Department Web sites as an example of a success in the department 's `` Heroes '' program .
In operation since 1984 , Heroes is operated by the department 's diplomatic security service .
It provides rewards and relocation to the United States to tipsters who thwart international terrorist activities .
According to the State Department , ...MORE OVERLAND PARK , Kan. -- ...international terrorist activities .
According to the State Department , the east Asian informant came forward with `` alarming information '' about a series of attacks planned by the Iraqi intelligence service .
One attack was 48 hours shy of being carried out and involved the planned bombing and machine gun assault of airline ticket counters at a `` major airport . ''
The Web site does not address what happened to the alleged terrorists , other than to say `` they were stopped in their tracks by U.S. and host nation authorities . ''
Nancy Orrick , another attorney representing Abufakher , said in a sworn affidavit that she contacted the State Department agent that Abufakher said he worked with , Mike Posillico .
He was a colleague of Smith , the anti-terrorism program director , who died in January .
Posillico , who could not be reached by The Kansas City Star , `` confirmed that he knew Mr. Abufakher , but could not provide any direct information due to the nature of his work , '' according to Orrick 's affidavit .
Posillico told her that the State Department Web sites contained information about Abufakher , Orrick said .
`` Agent Posillico told me that I might be interested in looking under the heading ` Operation Desert Storm , ' '' according to the affidavit .
The story of the east Asian informant is the only one under that heading .
It is the State Department 's `` longstanding policy '' to not discuss individuals involved in the Heroes program , said Andy Laine , a spokesman for the diplomatic security service .
In the case referred to on the Web sites , the individual who thwarted the Iraqi attacks was paid a reward of about $ 500,000 and relocated to the United States .
Abufakher said in an earlier court hearing that he was in the United States under a special State Department program .
After being relocated to the United States , his attorneys said , Abufakher moved to Seattle in 1991 and lived in Tampa before moving to the Kansas City area by early 1998 .
According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations , a handful of special visas are issued each year for individuals who have provided assistance against terrorists and must be relocated for their own safety .
The Star has filed a written request with the immigration service to provide information about Abufakher 's immigration status and when he entered the United States .
Officials with the agency said they were processing the request .
Abufakher 's lawyers say that he has business and personal ties to the Kansas City area and has no intention of leaving the area if released on bond .
The information also includes letters from friends and business acquaintances attesting to Abufakher 's honesty and nonviolent character .
Among them is one by Medal of Honor winner Don Ballard , a business partner who said at an earlier court hearing that he would go so far as to move in with Abufakher to ensure that he stays in the area if released on bond .
By coming forward publicly , a person who helped thwart a terrorist attack could be setting himself up for possible retribution , said Joseph Goldberg , a terrorism expert at the National Defense University in Washington , D.C .
