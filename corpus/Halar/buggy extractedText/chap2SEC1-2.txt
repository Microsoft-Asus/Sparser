ATOMS AND MOLECULES

 

 Atomic structure determines the behavior of an element



 

 Atoms combine by chemical bonding to form molecules



 

 Weak chemical bonds play important roles in the chemistry of life



 

 A molecule's biological function is related to its shape



 

 Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds



The properties of chemical elements and of the compounds they form, including the compounds crucial to life, ultimately result from the structure of atoms.
