WASHINGTON --
Marco Polo was intrigued by it nearly eight centuries ago .
The British fought for it in World War I , as did the Turks .
Hitler sent thousands of troops after it , ferrying supplies at times on camels , in a desperate and ultimately futile quest .
Now the vast crude oil of the Caspian Sea , the prize that has eluded foreign capture by so many for so long , appears at last within the grasp of the Western world .
When President Clinton arrives Monday in the Turkish capital of Ankara for a state visit with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit , high on the agenda will be the formal inking of an agreement to support the commercial construction of a pipeline connecting the oil-rich Caspian to the Turkish port of Ceyhan 1,100 miles away .
The $ 4 billion artery would be able , sometime early next century , to pump 1 million barrels a day of sour Caspian crude into the holds of tankers lying in wait in the Mediterranean Sea , from there to stoke the economies of the United States and two dozen of its closest allies .
Perhaps more to the point , it would give the United States , Europe and Israel direct access to oilfields that could hold as much as one-fifth of the world 's remaining crude , providing a strategically valuable alternative to Western dependence on supplies from the volatile Middle East .
`` The stakes are very big , '' said former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , who served in the Carter Administration .
`` Having unlimited access to it , access which is not controlled by a potentially hostile power , is very much in our interest . ''
Landlocked within the confines of Iran to its south and the former Soviet Union to its east , west and north , the 700-mile-long Caspian Sea contains at least six separate hydrocarbon basins , massive underground formations that trapped plant and animal detritus hundreds of millions of years ago and have held it captive ever since in the form of oil and natural gas .
Proven crude oil reserves are estimated in the range of 20 billion barrels or so , comparable to the 22.5 billion barrels in the United States and 17 billion barrels in the North Sea .
Industry geologists speculate , however , that the Caspian region could hold up to 200 billion barrels .
That would be as much as Iraq and Iran put together and would equal 20 percent of the world 's proven reserves of 1 trillion barrels .
`` It 's going to take a lot of years , and a lot of wells , before we know whether the Caspian region holds 30 billion barrels or 130 billion , '' international oil executive Nick Zana , of the San Francisco -based Chevron Corp. , told his peers at a conference in London earlier this year .
Either way , said Zana , `` there 's far too much at stake to stop investing . ''
The U.S. oil industry , indeed , has plans to invest tens of billions of dollars in exploration , drilling , refining and transportation projects in the region over the coming decade .
Chevron alone has agreed to invest $ 20 billion over the next 40 years in an oil development venture with the government of Kazakhstan , along the Caspian 's northeast coast .
Across the Caspian , in Azerbaijan , the Exxon Corp. , based in Irving , Texas , has staked a major claim .
Atlantic - Richfield , BP Amoco , Mobil , Texaco , Pennzoil , Phillips Petroleum and others are also heavily committed to the Caspian , following in the footsteps of prospectors who began tapping the region 's treasure through shallow hand-dug wells more than 200 years ago .
All have faced two main problems : geography and geopolitics in a harsh and remote region whose history of turbulence and bloodshed rivals that of the Balkans 1,000 miles to its west .
For most of this century , the bulk of the Caspian 's yield was used to fuel the Soviet Union .
It 's break-up eight years ago , however , left Caspian crude largely in the hands of Iran and four formerly Soviet republics : Russia , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan .
Still , only a small web of pipelines exists to transport the oil .
Most pass through the embattled region of Chechnya en route to the Russian port of Novorosiisk on the Black Sea .
Transportation from there to the Western world depends on tankers moving first through the Bosporus then the Dardanelles straits -- ancient commercial and strategic chokepoints , both under Turkish control .
For years now , American , British and Dutch oil companies have been locked in complicated international negotiations over the possibility of building several new Caspian pipelines .
The most ambitious , being studied by a consortium that includes Exxon , envisions a tube snaking for some 5,000 miles through the Himalayas and the Gobi desert to pipe oil to western China , at a cost estimated at upwards of $ 8.5 billion .
Clinton and Turkey 's Ecevit are expected to sign , as early as Monday , an accord meant to support a commercial project to build an oil pipeline that would run from the Caspian coastal city of Baku , in Azerbaijan , through the republic of Georgia , then into Turkey , terminating at the river port of Ceyhan .
The two leaders are also expected to give their blessing to a separate natural gas pipeline from Ceyhan to Turkmenistan .
Roughly 1,200 miles long , that pipeline would travel beneath the Caspian from Turkmenistan then overland through Azerbaijan , Georgia and into Turkey .
