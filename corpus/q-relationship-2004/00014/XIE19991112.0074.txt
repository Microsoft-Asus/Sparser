ISLAMABAD , November 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Pakistan has ruled out the possibility that the Afghan Taliban militia were behind a series of rocket attacks in Islamabad Friday morning .
A statement issued by the Foreign Office Friday asserted that `` there can be no doubt that these terrorist acts have been perpetrated by elements hostile to the interests of Pakistan and Afghanistan in addition to creating a sense of instability and insecurity . ''
`` We have noted the statement by the Taliban leadership strongly condemning these explosions , '' the statement said , adding that `` these acts of terrorism will not be allowed to create misunderstanding with friendly countries and misgivings in our external relations . ''
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar earlier Friday condemned the rocket attacks , describing them as `` a conspiracy '' to harm Taliban 's relations with Pakistan and to increase tension between Afghanistan and the United Nations and the United States .
