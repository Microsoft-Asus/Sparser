INVERTEBRATE CHORDATES AND THE ORIGIN OF VERTEBRATES

 

 Four anatomical features characterize the phylum Chordata



 

 Invertebrate chordates provide clues to the origin of vertebrates



The vertebrates are part of a phylogenetic branch of the animal kingdom consisting of deuterostomes (see FIGURE 32.4). The deuterostome branch has two main modern phyla: the chordates (which include the vertebrates) and the echinoderms. An echinoderm such as the sea star is the closest living relative of human beings among the well-known groups of invertebrates. However, the phylum Chordata itself also includes two groups of less well-known invertebrate animals: the urochordates and the cephalochordates. The urochordates and cephalochordates are therefore more closely related to us than is a sea star. FIGURE 34.1 is a cladogram of some of the animal groups we will examine during the first part of this chapter.

The upper right cladogram places the chordates in the context of bilaterian evolution (see Chapters 32 and 33); the enlarged cladogram introduces the major chordate clades we'll be discussing in the first part of the chapter. In the rest of the chapter, we'll take a closer look at the jawed vertebrates. Some of the derived characters that define certain clades are also indicated in this diagram (for example, all chordates, and only chordates, have notochords).
