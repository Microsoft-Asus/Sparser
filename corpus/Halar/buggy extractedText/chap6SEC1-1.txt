METABOLISM,ENERGY, AND LIFE

 

 The chemistry of life is organized into metabolic pathways



 

 Organisms transform energy



 

 The energy transformations of life are subject t+o two laws of thermodynamics



 

 Organisms live at the expense of free energy



 

 ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions



The totality of an organism's chemical reactions is called metabolism (from the Greek metabole, change). Metabolism is an emergent property of life that arises from interactions between molecules within the orderly environment of the cell.
