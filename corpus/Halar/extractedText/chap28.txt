Chapter 28: THE ORIGINS OF EUKARYOTIC DIVERSITY

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROTISTS

   Systematists have split protists into many kingdoms

   Protists are the most diverse of all eukaryotes



THE ORIGIN AND EARLY DIVERSIFICATION OF EUKARYOTES

   Endomembranes contributed to larger, more complex cells

   Mitochondria and plastids evolved from endosymbiotic bacteria

   The eukaryotic cell is a chimera of prokaryotic ancestors

   Secondary endosymbiosis increased the diversity of algae

   Research on the relationships between the three domains is changing ideas about the deepest branching in the tree of life

   The origin of eukaryotes catalyzed a second great wave of diversification



A SAMPLE OF PROTISTAN DIVERSITY

   Diplomonadida and Parabasala: Diplomonads and parabasalids lack mitochondria

   Euglenozoa: The euglenozoa includes both photosynthetic and heterotrophic flagellates

   Alveolata: The alveolates are unicellular protists with subsurface cavities (alveoli)

   Stramenopila: The stramenopile clade includes the water molds and the heterokont algae

   Structural and biochemical adaptations help seaweeds survive and reproduce at the ocean's margins

   Some algae have life cycles with alternating multicellular haploid and diploid generations

   Rhodophyta: Red algae lack flagella

   Chlorophyta: Green algae and plants evolved from a common photoautotrophic ancestor

   A diversity of protists use pseudopodia for movement and feeding

   Mycetozoa: Slime molds have structural adaptations and life cycles that enhance their ecological roles as decomposers

   Multicellularity originated independently many times

"No more pleasant sight has met my eye than this of so many thousands of living creatures in one small drop of water," wrote Anton van Leeuwenhoek after his discovery of the microbial world more than three centuries ago. It is a world every biology student rediscovers by peering through a microscope into a droplet of pond water filled with diverse creatures we call protists (see the photograph on this page).

Protists are eukaryotic, and thus even the simplest protists are much more complex than the prokaryotes. The first eukaryotes to evolve from prokaryotic ancestors were unicellular. The primal eukaryotes were not only the predecessors of the great variety of modern protists but were also ancestral to all other eukaryotes--plants, fungi, and animals. Two of the most significant chapters in the history of life--the origin of the eukaryotic cell and the subsequent emergence of multicellular eukaryotes--unfolded during the evolution of protists.

This chapter traces the origins of eukaryotic cells, examines the diversity, evolution, and ecology of protists, and considers the evolutionary origins of multicellular organization.
