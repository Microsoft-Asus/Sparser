Epinephrine uses this sort of receptor.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText">Tyrosine-kinase receptors react to the binding of signal molecules by forming dimers and then adding phosphate groups to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. Relay proteins in the cell can then be activated by binding to different phosphorylated tyrosines, allowing this receptor to trigger several pathways at once.

Many G proteins and tyrosine-kinase receptors activate an enzyme that splits a plasma membrane phospholipid into two second messengers, one of which is inositol trisphosphate (IP<SUB>3</SUB>). IP<SUB>3</SUB> is the ligand for a gated calcium channel in the membrane of the ER, which stores Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> at high concentrations.

The particular combination of proteins in a cell gives the cell great specificity in both the signals it detects and the responses it carries out. Scaffolding proteins can increase signal-transduction efficiency by holding multiple components of a pathway together. Pathway branching and cross-talk further help the cell coordinate signals and responses.</p></LI></UL></table></body></html>
