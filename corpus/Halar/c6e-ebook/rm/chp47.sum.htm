The acrosomal reaction, which occurs when the sperm meets the egg, releases hydrolytic enzymes that digest through material surrounding the egg. Gamete fusion depolarizes the egg cell membrane and sets up a fast block to polyspermy. Sperm-egg fusion also initiates the cortical reaction, involving a signal-transduction pathway in which calcium ions stimulate cortical granules to erect a fertilization envelope that functions as a slow block to polyspermy. In mammalian fertilization, the cortical reaction hardens the zona pellucida as a slow block to polyspermy.</p></LI><LI><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cleavage partitions the zygote into many smaller cells (pp. 1002-1005,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Fertilization is followed by cleavage, a period of rapid cell division without growth, which results in the production of a large number of cells called blastomeres. Holoblastic cleavage, or division of the entire egg, occurs in species whose eggs have little or moderate amounts of yolk. Meroblastic cleavage, incomplete division of the egg, occurs in species with yolk-rich eggs. Cleavage planes usually follow a specific pattern relative to the animal and vegetal poles of the zygote. In many species, cleavage creates a multicellular ball called the blastula, which contains a fluid-filled cavity, the blastocoel.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity47A:<span class="Emphasis1">

A cap of cells called the blastodisc forms and begins gastrulation with the formation of the primitive streak. In addition to the embryo, the three germ layers give rise to the four extraembryonic membranes: the yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois. The eggs of placental mammals are small and store little food, exhibiting holoblastic cleavage with no obvious polarity. Gastrulation and organogenesis, however, resemble the processes in birds and reptiles. After fertilization and early cleavage in the oviduct, the blastocyst implants in the uterus. The trophoblast initiates formation of the fetal portion of the placenta, and the embryo proper develops from a single layer of cells, the epiblast, within the blastocyst. Extraembryonic membranes homologous to those of birds and reptiles function in intrauterine development.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BASIS OF MORPHOGENESIS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN ANIMALS</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Morphogenesis in animals involves specific changes in cell shape, position, and adhesion (pp. 1012-1014,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 47.16</span>, <span class="SmallCap">47.17</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Cytoskeletal rearrangements are responsible for changes in both shape and position of cells. Both kinds of changes are involved in tissue invaginations, as occurs in gastrulation, for example. The extracellular matrix provides anchorage for cells and also helps guide migrating cells toward their destinations. Cell adhesion molecules on cell surfaces are also important for cell migration and for holding cells together in tissues.</p></LI><LI><a name="para26"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The developmental fate of cells depends on cytoplasmic determinants and cell-cell induction: <span class="Emphasis1">a review</span> (p. 1014)</span></p></LI><LI><a name="para27"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Fate mapping can reveal cell genealogies in chordate embryos (pp. 1014-1015,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.20</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Experimentally derived fate maps of embryos have shown that specific regions of the zygote or blastula develop into specific parts of older embryos.</p></LI><LI><a name="para28"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The eggs of most vertebrates have cytoplasmic determinants that help establish the body axes and differences among cells of the early embryo (pp. 1015-1016,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.21</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> When cytoplasmic determinants are heterogeneously distributed in an egg, they serve as the basis for setting up differences among parts of the egg and, later, among the blastomeres resulting from cleavage of the zygote.

This information is often in the form of signal molecules secreted by cells in special "organizer" regions of the embryo, such as the dorsal lip of the blastopore in the amphibian gastrula and the apical ectodermal ridge of the vertebrate limb bud. The signal molecules influence gene expression in the cells that receive them, leading to differentiation and the development of particular structures.</p></LI></UL></table></body></html>
