MANAGUA , September 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Nicaraguan government is concerned about the possibility of drug trafficking money being used to fund campaigns for the October 20 elections .
On Monday , the government submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice a draft law against money laundering .
The law would extend penalties from four to 25 years jail for candidates who received illicit funds .
Vice Interior Minister Frank Cesar said today that the government was confident the National Assembly -LRB- parliament -RRB- would rapidly pass the law against laundering money from drug trafficking and other connected crimes .
There was no evidence of funding political parties in the country by drug cartels , but the possibility should not be dismissed , he said .
`` There is no proof of it , but the possibilities are very strong , and we must be alert to it . ''
Cesar said that learning from the experiences of Colombia and Panama , `` It should be the candidates themselves who ought to control their financing committees to prevent illicit funds from entering their campaigns .
`` I am making a warning to awaken people about the need for approving this law to prevent money laundering , for which the country is completely unprepared , '' he added .
The draft law , with 59 articles , stipulates procedures for investigation , penalties , protection of witnesses , access to bank deposits , and the creation of a technical commission to investigate specific cases .
