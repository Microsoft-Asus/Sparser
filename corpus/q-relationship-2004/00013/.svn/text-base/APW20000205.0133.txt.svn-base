WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Despite evidence he kept government secrets on unsecured computers at home , former CIA Director John Deutch maintains a Pentagon clearance that allows him access to classified defense information , a senior defense official confirmed Saturday .
George Tenet , Deutch 's successor as CIA director , revoked Deutch 's CIA clearance last summer after investigators discovered he kept classified documents on home computers that were connected to the Internet and unprotected by security devices .
The Pentagon also suspended his security clearance from the Defense Intelligence Agency , the nation 's main military intelligence service .
Before becoming CIA director , Deutch served as deputy secretary of defense from 1994 to 1995 .
But he never lost his industrial security clearance -- a status that , to this day , allows him to serve as a paid consultant on defense contracts with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , SAIC Corp. and Raytheon Corp. , said the Pentagon official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
`` The type of information that would relate to industrial clearances relate to specific programs in the institutions within which he is working , as opposed to if you have a high-level security clearance , you have access to a broad range of intelligence information , '' the official said .
`` Industrial clearances are more limited , '' the official continued .
`` If any information were compromised , it poses less of a threat to national security . ''
Deutch 's industrial security clearance was first reported Saturday by The Washington Post .
Deutch , now a professor at MIT , is one of thousands of people , mainly defense contractors , who hold industrial clearances , the official said , adding there is no evidence at this point to warrant revoking Deutch 's clearance .
Also , an industrial security clearance is harder to revoke because a person 's livelihood may depend on it , the official said .
