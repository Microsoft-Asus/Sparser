As the only superpower in the present world , the United States has seen its influence become relatively weakened .
Its past opponent and enemy - the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact Organization - no longer exist .
Hence , from Terrill 's point of view , China is no longer needed to be taken as a `` strategic partner '' of the United States to counter its enemies .
But on the contrary , the US nevetheless needs to find a new `` imaginary enemy '' to contend with .
Therefore , in Terrill 's minds , China is his `` imaginary enemy . ''
Since Terrill intended to be hostile to the Chinese people , it is not at all surprising that he dished up the theory of the outdatedness of the `` One China '' policy , and alleged that `` the evolution of events '' would eventually force the US to `` renounce '' the `` One China '' policy .
It is known to all that the adherence to this policy is the basis for the development of bilateral relationship between China and the US .
Terrill is deliberately bent on undermining this basis , but his attempt was ridiculous , just like an ant trying to topple a giant tree .
As two big countries with significant international influences , China and the US play important roles in maintaining the peace and security of the whole world .
The common interests of the two countries far outweigh their differences .
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has declared time and again that China and the US should increase trust , reduce conflict , develop cooperation and avoid confrontation .
This is in conformity with the fundamental interests of the people of both countries .
Acting in a diametrically opposite way , Terrill and his like can only indulge themselves in wishful thinking .
