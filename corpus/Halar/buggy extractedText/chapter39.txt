At every stage in the life of a plant, sensitivity to the environment and coordination of responses are evident. One part of a plant can send signals to other parts. For example, the terminal bud at the apex of a shoot is able to suppress the growth of axillary buds that may be many meters away. Plants keep track of the time of day and the time of year. They can sense gravity and the direction of light. For example, the grass seedling in the photograph on this page is growing toward light. A plant's morphology and physiology are constantly tuned to its variable surroundings by complex interactions between environmental stimuli and internal signals.

This chapter focuses on how plants respond to these external and internal cues. At the organismal level, plants and animals respond to environmental stimuli by very different means. Animals, being mobile, respond mainly by behavioral mechanisms, moving toward positive stimuli and away from negative stimuli. Rooted to one location for life, a plant generally responds to environmental cues by adjusting its pattern of growth and development. For this reason, plants of the same species vary in body form much more than do animals of the same species. All lions have four limbs and approximately the same body proportions, but oak trees vary considerably in their number of limbs and their shapes. But at the cellular level, plants, animals, and all other eukaryotes are surprisingly similar in their signaling mechanisms. We begin our study of plant response with the role of signal transduction in plant cells.





SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND PLANT RESPONSES

 

 Signal-transduction pathways link internal and environmental signals to cellular responses



All organisms, including plants, have the ability to receive specific environmental and internal signals and respond to them in ways that enhance survival and reproductive success. Bees, which possess UV-sensitive photoreceptors in their eyes, can discern nectar-guiding patterns on flower petals--patterns that are completely invisible to humans. A dog sniffing a fire hydrant receives information about its olfactory world, the nature of which we, with our inferior sense of smell, can only surmise. Plants, too, have cellular receptors that they use to detect important changes in their environment, whether the change is an increase in the concentration of a growth hormone, an injury from a caterpillar munching on leaves, or a decrease in day length as winter approaches.

In order for an internal or external stimulus to elicit a physiological response, certain cells within the organism must possess an appropriate receptor, a molecule that is sensitive to and affected by the specific stimulus. For example, our blindness to UV-reflecting floral patterns is due to our eyes lacking the necessary UV photoreceptors. Upon receiving a stimulus, a receptor initiates a specific series of biochemical steps, a signal transduction pathway, which couples reception of the stimulus to the response of the organism. As you will learn, plants are sensitive to a wide range of internal and external stimuli, and each of these stimuli initiates a specific signal transduction pathway. We introduced general concepts of signal transduction in cells in Chapter 11. Here, we apply those concepts to specific examples in plants.





PLANT RESPONSES TO HORMONES

 

 Research on how plants grow toward light led to the discovery of plant hormones



 

 Plant hormones help coordinate growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli



The word hormone is derived from a Greek verb meaning "to excite." Found in all multicellular organisms, hormones are chemical signals that coordinate the parts of the organism. By definition, a hormone is a compound that is produced by one part of the body and then transported to other parts of the body, where it binds to a specific receptor and triggers responses in target cells and tissues. Another important characteristic of hormones is that only minute amounts are required to induce substantial change in an organism. Hormone concentrations or the rates of their transport can change in response to environmental stimuli. Often the response of a plant is governed by the interaction of two or more hormones.

 Photoperiodism synchronizes many plant responses to changes of season



Light is an especially important environmental factor in the lives of plants. In addition to being required for photosynthesis, light also cues many key events in plant growth and development. These effects of light on plant morphology are what plant biologists call photomorphogenesis. Light reception is also important in allowing plants to measure the passage of days and seasons.

Plants detect not just the presence of light, but also its direction, intensity, and wavelengths (colors). Recall from Chapter 10 that an action spectrum is a graph that relates physiological response to wavelength of light. The action spectrum for photosynthesis, for example, has two peaks, one in the red and one in the blue (see FIGURE 10.8). This is because chlorophyll absorbs light primarily in the red and blue portions of the visible spectrum. Action spectra, however, are useful in the study of any process that depends on light. By comparing action spectra of different plant responses researchers can determine which responses are mediated by the same photoreceptor (pigment). Scientists can also compare action spectra to the absorption spectra of putative photoreceptor molecules. An absorption spectrum is a graph profiling the wavelengths of light a particular pigment absorbs. A close correspondence between an action spectrum of a plant response and the absorption spectrum of a purified pigment suggests that the pigment may be the photoreceptor involved in mediating the response.

Action spectra reveal that red and blue light are the most important colors in regulating a plant's photomorphogenesis. These observations led researchers to two major classes of light receptors: a heterogeneous group of blue-light photoreceptors and a family of photoreceptors called phytochromes that absorb mostly red light.





PLANT RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI OTHER THAN LIGHT

 

 Plants respond to environmental stimuli through a combination of developmental and physiological mechanisms



Plants can neither migrate to a watering hole when water is scarce nor seek shelter when the weather is too windy. A seed, landing upside down in the soil, cannot maneuver itself into an upright position. Because of their immobility, plants must adjust to a wide range of environmental circumstances through developmental and physiological mechanisms. Natural selection has refined these responses. Light is so important in the life of a plant that we devoted the entire previous section to a plant's reception of and response to this one environmental factor. In this section, we examine responses to some of the other environmental stimuli that a plant commonly faces in its "struggle for existence."





PLANT DEFENSE: RESPONSES TO HERBIVORES AND PATHOGENS

 

 Plants deter herbivores with both physical and chemical defenses



 

 Plants use multiple lines of defense against pathogens



Plants do not exist in isolation, but interact with many other species in their communities. Some of these interspecific interactions--for example, the associations of plants with fungi in mycorrhizae (see Chapter 37) or with insect pollinators (see Chapter 38)--are mutually beneficial. Most of the interactions that plants have with other organisms, however, are not beneficial to the plant. As primary producers, plants are at the base of most food webs and are subject to attack by a wide range of plant-eating (herbivorous) animals. A plant is also subject to infection by a diversity of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi that have the potential to damage tissues or even kill the plant. Plants counter these threats with defense systems that deter herbivory and prevent infection or combat pathogens that do manage to infect the plant.





 Signal-transduction pathways link internal and environmental signals to cellular responses

In the back corner of a food cabinet, a long forgotten potato (a modified underground stem, or tuber) has sprouted shoots from its "eyes" (axillary buds). These shoots, however, scarcely resemble those of a typical plant. Instead of broad green leaves and sturdy stems, these dark-sprouted shoots are ghostly pale, have stems that are long and thin, bear leaves that are unexpanded, and give rise to roots that are reduced (FIGURE 39.1a). Seedlings germinated in the dark have a similar appearance. These morphological adaptations for growing in darkness make sense if we consider that a potato or a seedling, in nature, usually encounters continuous darkness when sprouting underground. In such circumstances, the pre-emergent plant is supported by the surrounding soil and would not benefit from a thick stem. Expanded leaves would be a hindrance to soil penetration and would be damaged as the shoots pushed upward. Because the leaves are unexpanded, there is little evaporative loss of water, and little requirement for an extensive root system to replace the water lost by transpiration. The energy expended in producing green chlorophyll would be wasted since there is no light for photosynthesis. Rather, a plant growing in the dark allocates as much energy as possible to the elongation of stems. This "strategy" enables the shoots to break ground before the stored food reserves in the tuber or seed are exhausted.

Fig 39-1. Light-induced greening of dark-sprouted potatoes. (a) A dark-grown potato has tall, spindly stems and nonexpanded leaves--a morphological adaptation that enables the shoots to penetrate the soil. The roots are short, but little water is lost by the shoots. (b) After a week's exposure to natural daylight, the potato plant begins to resemble a typical plant with broad green leaves, short sturdy stems, and long roots. This transformation begins with the reception of light by a specific pigment

Once a shoot reaches the sunlight, its morphology and biochemistry undergo profound changes collectively called greening: the elongation rate of the stems slows, the leaves expand, the roots start to elongate, and the entire shoot begins to produce chlorophyll; in short, it begins to resemble a typical plant (FIGURE 39.1b). In the following discussion, we use this greening response as an example of how a plant cell receives a signal--in this case, light--and how this reception is transduced into a response (greening). Along the way we will explore how studies of mutants have provided valuable insights into the roles played by various molecules in the three stages of cell-signal processing: reception, transduction, and response (FIGURE 39.2).

Fig 39-2. Review of a general model for signal-transduction pathways. A hormone or other signal binding to a specific receptor stimulates the cell to produce second messengers. Second messengers trigger the cell's various responses to the original signal. In this diagram, the receptor is on the surface of the target cell. In other cases, hormones enter cells and bind to specific receptors inside.

Reception

Signals, whether internal or external, are first detected by receptors, proteins that undergo conformational changes in response to a specific stimulus. The receptor involved in greening in plants is called phytochrome, which consists of a light-absorbing pigment attached to a specific protein. Unlike many receptors, which are built into the plasma membrane, the phytochrome that functions in greening occurs in the cytoplasm. Researchers have demonstrated the requirement for phytochrome in greening through studies of a tomato mutant called aurea. The mutant, which has lower-than-normal levels of phytochrome, greens less than wild-type tomatoes when exposed to light. (The name aurea comes from the Latin for "gold-colored." In the absence of chlorophyll, the yellow plant pigments called carotenoids are more obvious.) Researchers were able to produce a normal greening response by using a microneedle to inject phytochrome extracted from other plants into aurea leaf cells and then exposing the aurea to light. Such experiments support the hypothesis that phytochrome functions in light detection in the greening process.

Transduction

The greening response is triggered by extremely low levels of light. For example, light levels equivalent to a few seconds of moonlight are sufficient to cause a slowing of stem elongation in dark-grown oat seedlings. Receptors such as phytochrome are sensitive to very weak environmental and chemical signals. How is the information from these extremely weak signals amplified, and how is their reception transduced into a specific response by the plant? The answer is second messengers--small, internally produced chemicals that transfer and amplify the signal from the receptor to proteins that cause the specific response. In the greening response, for example, each activated phytochrome may give rise to hundreds of molecules of a second messenger, each of which, in turn, may lead to the activation of hundreds of molecules of a specific enzyme. By such mechanisms, the second messenger of a signal transduction pathway leads to a rapid amplification of the signal. In Chapter 11, we examined this role of second messengers in general (see FIGURE 11.12). Here, let's specifically consider the production of second messengers and their function in the greening response (FIGURE 39.3). Refer to the diagram frequently as you read the text description of this complex process.

Fig 39-3. An example of signal transduction in plants: the role of phytochrome in the greening response. The light signal is detected by the phytochrome receptor, which then activates at least two signal-transduction pathways involving G-proteins. 
			  
		 One pathway leads to cGMP as a second messenger that activates a protein kinase cascade (see FIGURE 11.11). 
			  
		 The other pathway leads to formation of a Ca2+1-calmodulin complex that activates a specific protein kinase. 
			  
		 Both pathways lead to expression of genes for the proteins that function in the greening response. We do not present such a complex diagram because its details are important for you to remember. The main point of this diagram: Signal transduction pathways in plants are variations of the general schemes you learned about in Chapter 11, involving such components as G-proteins, second messengers, and protein kinases.

As we discussed in Chapter 11, many receptors interact with guanine-binding proteins (G-proteins). Phytochrome is such a receptor. Light causes phytochrome to undergo a conformational change, and the phytochrome then interacts with a specific G-protein. During activation, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) that is bound to the inactive G-protein is displaced by guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The G-protein, now in its active form, in turn activates other enzymes in the signal-transduction pathway that leads to greening. For example, phytochrome-activated G-proteins activate guanyl cyclase, the enzyme that produces cyclic GMP, a second messenger. In aurea tomato cells, G-protein inhibitors such as cholera toxin block greening after microinjection of phytochrome, whereas G-protein activators such as pertussis toxin stimulate the response.

The cyclic nucleotides are second messengers that include cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP). In some cases, cyclic nucleotides activate specific protein kinases (enzymes that phosphorylate and activate other proteins--see FIGURE 11.11). Experiments indicate that cyclic GMP (cGMP) is involved in the greening process. The microinjection of cGMP into aurea tomato cells induces a partial greening response, even without addition of phytochrome.

Changes in cytosolic Ca+ also play an important role in phytochrome signal transduction. The levels of Ca+ are generally very low in the cytosol (about 10-7M). However, a wide range of hormonal and environmental stimuli can cause brief increases in cytosolic Ca+. In many cases, Ca2+ then binds directly to small proteins called calmodulins. The Ca+-calmodulin complex then binds to and activates several enzymes, most notably certain types of protein kinases. Note in FIGURE 39.3 that phytochrome activation during the greening mechanism results in both cGMP and Ca+-calmodulin as second messengers.

Response

Ultimately, a signal-transduction pathway leads to the regulation of one or more cellular activities. In most cases, especially when changes in development are involved, these responses to stimulation involve the increased activity of certain enzymes. The two main mechanisms by which a signaling pathway can activate an enzyme are by stimulating transcription of mRNA for the enzyme or by activating existing enzyme molecules (post-translational modification).

Transcriptional Regulation.Transcription factors bind directly to specific regions of DNA and control the transcription of specific genes (see FIGURE 19.8). In the case of phytochrome-induced greening, several transcription factors are activated by phosphorylation in response to the appropriate light conditions. The activation of some of these transcription factors depends upon cyclic GMP, whereas the activation of others requires Ca+-calmodulin.

The mechanism by which a signal promotes a new developmental course may depend on the activation of positive transcriptional factors (proteins that increase transcription of specific genes) or the deactivation of negative transcriptional factors (proteins that decrease transcription), or both. For example, there are Arabidopsis mutants that, except for their pale color, have a light-grown morphology (expanded leaves and short, sturdy stems) when grown in the dark (they are not green because the final step in chlorophyll production requires direct light). These mutants have defects in a negative transcriptional factor that inhibits the expression of other genes normally activated by light. When the negative factor is eliminated by mutation, the pathway that it normally blocks becomes activated: hence, these mutants, except for their pale color, appear to have been grown in the light.

Post-Translational Modification of Proteins.Although the synthesis of new proteins by transcription and translation are important molecular events associated with greening, so are post-translational modifications of existing proteins. Most often these existing proteins are modified by phosphorylation, the addition of a phosphate group onto the protein. The diverse proteins called protein kinases catalyze this phosphorylation of target proteins (see FIGURE 11.11). Many second messengers, such as cGMP, and some receptors themselves, including some forms of phytochrome, activate protein kinases directly. About 2-3%  of all plant genes may encode for protein kinases. Often one protein kinase will phosphorylate another protein kinase, which then phosphorylates another, and so on. Such kinase cascades may eventually link initial stimuli to responses at the level of gene expression, usually via the phosphorylation of transcription factors. By such mechanisms, many signal pathways ultimately regulate the synthesis of new proteins, usually by turning specific genes on or off (FIGURE 39.3).

Signal pathways must also have a means for turning off once the initial signal is no longer present--for example, what if we put the potato back into the cupboard? Protein phosphatases, enzymes that dephosphorylate specific proteins, are involved in these "switch-off" processes. At any given moment, the activities of a cell depend upon the balance of activity of many types of protein kinases and protein phosphatases.

The Greening Proteins.What sorts of proteins are either newly transcibed or activated by phosphorylation during the greening process? Many are enzymes that function in photosynthesis directly; others are enzymes involved in supplying the chemical precursors necessary for chlorophyll production; still others affect the levels of plant hormones that regulate growth. For example, the levels of two hormones that enhance stem elongation will decrease following phytochrome activation--hence, the reduction in stem elongation that accompanies greening.

We have discussed the signal transduction involved in the greening response of a potato in some detail to give you a sense of the complexity of biochemical changes that underlie this one process. As you read on, keep in mind that every plant hormone and every environmental stimulus triggers one or more signal transduction pathways of comparable complexity. As we have seen in the case of the tomato mutant aurea, the techniques of molecular biology combined with studies of mutants are helping researchers elucidate these various pathways. But molecular biology builds upon a long history of careful physiological and biochemical investigations into how plants work. Indeed, as you will read in the next section, it was classical observations and experiments that provided biologists with the first clue that chemical signals--hormones--serve as internal regulators of plant growth and development.





 Research on how plants grow toward light led to the discovery of plant hormones

The concept of chemical messengers in plants emerged from a series of classic experiments on how stems respond to light. A houseplant on a windowsill grows toward light. If you rotate the plant, it will soon reorient its growth until its leaves again face the window. Any growth response that results in curvatures of whole plant organs toward or away from stimuli is called a tropism (from the Greek tropos, turn). The growth of a shoot toward light is called positive phototropism (growth away from light is negative phototropism).

In a forest or other natural ecosystem where plants may be crowded, phototropism directs growing seedlings toward the sunlight that powers photosynthesis. What is the mechanism for this adaptive response? Much of what is known about phototropism has been learned from studies of grass seedlings, particularly oats. The shoot of a grass seedling is enclosed in a sheath called the coleoptile, which grows straight upward if the seedling is kept in the dark or if it is illuminated uniformly from all sides. If the growing coleoptile is illuminated from one side, it will curve toward the light (see the photograph that opens the chapter). This response results from a differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the coleoptile; the cells on the darker side elongate faster than the cells on the brighter side.

Charles Darwin and his son, Francis, conducted some of the earliest experiments on phototropism in the late 19th century. They observed that a grass seedling could bend toward light only if the tip of the coleoptile was present (FIGURE 39.4). If the tip was removed, the coleoptile would not curve. The seedling would also fail to grow toward light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap; neither a transparent cap over the tip nor an opaque shield placed farther down the coleoptile prevented the phototropic response. It was the tip of the coleoptile, the Darwins concluded, that was responsible for sensing light. However, the actual growth response, the curvature of the coleoptile, occurred some distance below the tip. The Darwins postulated that some signal was transmitted downward from the tip to the elongating region of the coleoptile. A few decades later, Peter Boysen-Jensen of Denmark tested this hypothesis and demonstrated that the signal was a mobile chemical substance. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a block of gelatin, which would prevent cellular contact but allow chemicals to pass. These seedlings behaved normally, bending toward light. However, if the tip was experimentally segregated from the lower coleoptile by an impermeable barrier, no phototropic response occurred.

Fig 39-4. Early experiments of phototropism. Only the tip of the coleoptile can sense the direction of light, but the bending response occurs some distance below the tip. A signal of some kind must travel downward from the tip. The signal can pass through a permeable barrier (gelatin block) but not through a solid barrier (a mineral called mica), suggesting that the signal for phototropism is a mobile chemical.

In 1926, F. W. Went, a Dutch graduate student, extracted the chemical messenger for phototropism by modifying the experiments of Boysen-Jensen (FIGURE 39.5). Went removed the coleoptile tip and placed it on a block of agar, a gelatinous material. The chemical messenger from the tip, Went reasoned, should diffuse into the agar, and the agar block should then be able to substitute for the coleoptile tip. Went placed the agar blocks on decapitated coleoptiles that were kept in the dark. A block that was centered on top of the coleoptile caused the stem to grow straight upward. However, if the block was placed off center, then the coleoptile began to bend away from the side with the agar block, as though growing toward light. Went concluded that the agar block contained a chemical produced in the coleoptile tip, that this chemical stimulated growth as it passed down the coleoptile, and that a coleoptile curved toward light because of a higher concentration of the growth-promoting chemical on the darker side of the coleoptile. For this chemical messenger, or hormone, Went chose the name auxin (from the Greek auxein, to increase). Auxin was later purified and its structure determined by Kenneth Thimann and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology.

Fig 39-5. The Went experiments. Some chemical (indicated by pink) that can pass into an agar block from a coleoptile tip stimulates elongation of the coleoptile when the block is substituted for a tip. If the block is placed off-center on the top of a decapitated coleoptile kept in the dark, the organ bends as if responding to illumination from one side. The chemical is the hormone auxin, which stimulates elongation of cells in the shoot.

The classical hypothesis for what causes grass coleoptiles to grow toward light, based on the work of the Darwins and Went, is that an asymmetrical distribution of auxin moving down from the coleoptile tip causes cells on the darker side to elongate faster than cells on the brighter side. However, studies of phototropism by organs other than grass coleoptiles provide less support for this idea. For example, there is no evidence that unilateral light causes an asymmetrical distribution of auxin in the stems of sunflowers, radishes, and other dicots. There is, however, an asymmetrical distribution of certain substances that may act as growth inhibitors, with these substances more concentrated on the lighted side of a stem. Still, the specific case of auxin's role in the phototropism of grass coleoptiles opened up the whole field of research on plant hormones.





 Plant hormones help coordinate growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli

TABLE 39.1 previews some of the major classes of plant hormones: auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, ethylene, and brassinosteroids. Many of the molecules that function in defense of the plant against pathogens are probably plant hormones as well. (These molecules will be discussed later in the chapter.) Notice that all of the hormones shown in TABLE 39.1 are relatively small molecules. Their transport from cell to cell often involves passage across cell walls, a pathway that blocks the movement of large molecules.

Table 39-1. An Overview of Plant Hormones

HormoneWhere Produced or Found in PlantMajor FunctionsAuxin (IAA)
			  
		Embryo of seed, meristems of apical buds, young leavesStimulates stem elongation (low concentration only) root growth, cell differentiation, and branching; regulates development of fruit; enhances apical dominance; functions in phototropism and gravitropism.Cytokinins (such as zeatin)

		Leaves, stems, roots, green fruitInhibits growth; closes stomata during water stress; counteracts breaking of dormancyEthylene
			  
		Tissues of ripening fruits, nodes of stems, aging leves and flowersPromotes fruit ripening, opposes some auxin effects; promotes or inhibits growth and development of roots, leaves, and flowers, depending on speciesBrassinosteroids (such as brassinolide)
			  
		Seeds, fruits, shoots, leaves, and floral budsInhibits root growth; retards leaf abscission; promotes xylem differentiationIn general, hormones control plant growth and development by affecting the division, elongation, and differentiation of cells. Some hormones also mediate shorter-term physiological responses of plants to environmental stimuli. Each hormone has multiple effects, depending on its site of action, its concentration, and the developmental stage of the plant.

Plant hormones are produced in very low concentrations, but a minute amount of hormone can have a profound effect on the growth and development of a plant organ. This implies that the hormonal signal must be amplified in some way. A hormone may act by altering the expression of genes, by affecting the activity of existing enzymes, or by changing properties of membranes. Any of these actions could redirect the metabolism and development of a cell responding to a small number of hormone molecules. Signal transduction pathways amplify the hormonal signal and connect it to a cell's specific responses.

Response to a hormone usually depends not so much on the absolute amount of that hormone as on its relative concentration compared with other hormones. It is hormonal balance, rather than hormones acting in isolation, that may control the growth and development of the plant. These interactions will become apparent in the following survey of hormone function.

Auxin

The term auxin is used for any chemical substance that promotes the elongation of coleoptiles, although auxins actually have multiple functions in both monocots and dicots. The natural auxin occurring in plants is indoleacetic acid, or IAA, but several other compounds, including some synthetic ones, have auxin activity. Throughout this chapter, however, the name auxin is used specifically to refer to IAA. Although auxin was the first plant hormone to be discovered, much remains to be learned about auxin signal transduction and the regulation of auxin biosynthesis. Current evidence suggests that auxin is produced from the amino acid tryptophan in the shoot tips of plants.

The speed at which auxin is transported down the stem from the shoot apex is about 10 mm per hour--much too fast for diffusion, although slower than translocation in phloem. Auxin seems to be transported directly through parenchyma tissue, from one cell to the next. It moves only from shoot tip to base, not in the reverse direction. This unidirectional transport of auxin is called polar transport. Polar transport has nothing to do with gravity, for auxin travels upward in experiments where a stem or coleoptile segment is placed upside down. Polar auxin transport requires energy. FIGURE 39.6 illustrates how proton pumps in the plasma membrane, driven by ATP, couple metabolic energy to auxin transport. The mechanism of polar auxin transport is another example of cellular work driven by chemiosmosis, the harnessing of H+ gradients generated by proton pumps (see Chapter 9).

Although auxin affects several aspects of plant development, one of its chief functions is to stimulate the elongation of cells in young developing shoots.

The Role of Auxin in Cell Elongation.The apical meristem of a shoot is a major site of auxin synthesis. As auxin from the shoot apex moves down to the region of cell elongation (see Chapter 35), the hormone stimulates growth of the cells, probably by binding to a receptor built into the plasma membrane. Auxin stimulates growth only over a certain concentration range, from about 10-8 to 10-4M. At higher concentrations, auxin may inhibit cell elongation, probably by inducing the production of ethylene, a hormone that generally acts as an inhibitor of elongation. We will return to this hormonal interaction in the discussion of ethylene.

According to a proposal called the acid growth hypothesis, proton pumps play a major role in the growth response of cells to auxin. In a shoot's region of elongation, auxin stimulates plasma membrane proton pumps, an action that, within minutes, both increases the voltage across the membrane (membrane potential) and lowers the pH in the cell wall (FIGURE 39.7). The acidification of the wall activates enzymes called expansins that break the cross-links (hydrogen bonds) between cellulose microfibrils, loosening the fabric of the wall. (Expansins can even weaken the integrity of filter paper made of pure cellulose.) Increasing the membrane potential enhances ion uptake into the cell, which causes the osmotic uptake of water. The uptake of water, along with the increased plasticity of the walls, enables the cell to elongate.

Auxin also alters gene expression rapidly, causing cells in the region of elongation to produce new proteins within minutes. Some of these proteins are short-lived transcription factors that repress or activate the expression of other genes. For sustained growth after this initial spurt, cells must make more cytoplasm and wall material. Auxin also stimulates this sustained growth response.

Lateral and Adventitious Root Formation.Auxins are used commercially in the vegetative propagation of plants by cuttings. Treating a detached leaf or stem with rooting powder containing auxin often causes adventitious roots to form near the cut surface. Auxin is also involved in the branching of roots. Researchers found that an Arabidopsis mutant that exhibits extreme proliferation of lateral roots has an auxin concentration 17-fold higher than normal.

Auxins as Herbicides.Synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-D), are widely used as herbicides. Monocots, such as maize and turfgrass, can rapidly inactivate these synthetic auxins, but dicots cannot, and die from a hormonal overdose. Spraying cereal fields or turf with 2,4-D eliminates dicot (broadleaf) weeds such as dandelions.

Other Effects of Auxin.In addition to stimulating cell elongation for primary growth, auxin affects secondary growth by inducing cell division in the vascular cambium and by influencing the differentiation of secondary xylem (see Chapter 35). Developing seeds synthesize auxin, which promotes the growth of fruits in plants. Synthetic auxins sprayed on tomato vines induce fruit development without a need for pollination. This makes it possible to grow seedless tomatoes by substituting synthetic auxin for the auxin normally synthesized by the developing seeds.

Cytokinins

Trial-and-error attempts to find chemical additives that would enhance the growth and development of plant cells in tissue culture led to the discovery of cytokinins. In the 1940s, Johannes van Overbeek, working at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, found he could stimulate the growth of plant embryos by adding coconut milk, the liquid endosperm of a coconut's giant seed, to his culture medium. A decade later, Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller, at the University of Wisconsin, induced cultured tobacco cells to divide by adding degraded samples of DNA. The active ingredients of both experimental additives turned out to be modified forms of adenine, one of the components of nucleic acids. These growth regulators were named cytokinins because they stimulate cytokinesis, or cell division. Of the variety of cytokinins that occur naturally in plants, the most common is zeatin, so named because it was first discovered in maize (Zea mays).

Despite much effort, the enzyme that produces cytokinins has neither been purified from plants nor has the gene that encodes for it been identified. Mark Holland of Salisbury State University has proposed that plants may not even produce their own cytokinins: His hypothesis is that cytokinins are actually produced by prokaryotes called methylobacteria that live symbiotically inside actively growing plant tissues, even in in vitro cultures. Indeed, normal developmental processes are impaired when methylobacteria are eliminated, and these processes can be restored either by the reapplication of methylobacteria or the addition of cytokinins. Regardless of whether this provocative hypothesis gains support, the issue underscores the importance of genomic sequencing. Now that the sequencing of Arabidopsis is complete, the gene for a cytokinin-producing enzyme, if present, should be more easily identified.

Regardless of the source of cytokinins, plant cells do have cytokinin receptors. Some evidence points to the existence of two entirely different classes of cytokinin receptors, one intracellular and the other on the cell surface. The cytoplasmic receptor binds cytokinins directly and can stimulate transcription in isolated nuclei. In some plant cells, cytokinins open Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, causing an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Although much remains to be learned about cytokinin synthesis and signal transduction, some of the major effects that cytokinins have on the physiology and development of plants are well documented.

Control of Cell Division and Differentiation.Cytokinins are produced in actively growing tissues, particularly in roots, embryos, and fruits. Cytokinins produced in the root reach their target tissues by moving up the plant in the xylem sap. Acting in concert with auxin, cytokinins stimulate cell division and influence the pathway of differentiation. The effects of cytokinins on cells growing in tissue culture provide clues about how this class of hormones may function in an intact plant. When a piece of parenchyma tissue from a stem is cultured in the absence of cytokinins, the cells grow very large but do not divide. Cytokinins alone have no effect. If, however, cytokinins are added along with auxin, the cells divide. The ratio of cytokinin to auxin controls the differentiation of the cells. When the concentrations of the two hormones are balanced, the mass of cells continues to grow, but it remains a cluster of undifferentiated cells called a callus. If cytokinin levels are raised, shoot buds develop from the callus. If auxin levels are raised, roots form.

Control of Apical Dominance.Cytokinins, auxin, and other factors interact in the control of apical dominance, the ability of the terminal bud to suppress the development of axillary buds. Until recently, the leading hypothesis to explain the hormonal regulation of apical dominance--the direct inhibition hypothesis--proposed that auxin and cytokinin act antagonistically in regulating axillary bud growth. According to this view, auxin transported down the shoot from the terminal bud directly inhibited axillary buds from growing, causing a shoot to lengthen at the expense of lateral branching. Meanwhile, cytokinins entering the shoot system from roots counter the action of auxin by signaling axillary buds to begin growing. Thus, the ratio of auxin and cytokinin was viewed as the critical factor in controlling axillary bud inhibition. Many observations are consistent with the direct inhibition hypothesis. If the terminal bud, the primary source of auxin, is removed, the inhibition of axillary buds is removed and the plant becomes bushier (FIGURE 39.8). Application of auxin to the cut surface of the decapitated seedling resuppresses the growth of the lateral buds. Mutants that overproduce cytokinins or plants treated with cytokinins also tend to be bushier than normal. One prediction of the direct inhibition hypothesis not borne out by experiment is that decapitation, by removing the primary source of auxin, should lead to a decrease in the auxin levels of axillary buds. Biochemical studies, however, have revealed the opposite: auxin levels actually increase in the axillary buds of decapitated plants. The direct inhibition hypothesis, therefore, does not account for all experimental findings: It is likely that plant biologists have not uncovered all the pieces of this puzzle.

Fig 39-8. Apical dominance. (a) Auxin from the apical bud inhibits the growth of axillary buds. This favors elongation of the shoot's main axis. Cytokinins, which are transported upward from roots, counter auxin, stimulating the growth of axillary buds. This explains why, in many plants, axillary buds near the shoot tip are less likely to grow than those closer to the roots. (b) Removal of the apical bud from the same plant enabled lateral branches to grow.

Anti-Aging Effects.Cytokinins retard the aging of some plant organs by inhibiting protein breakdown, by stimulating RNA and protein synthesis, and by mobilizing nutrients from surrounding tissues. If leaves removed from a plant are dipped in a cytokinin solution, they stay green much longer than otherwise. Cytokinins also slow the deterioration of leaves on intact plants. Because of this anti-aging effect, florists use cytokinin sprays to keep cut flowers fresh.

Gibberellins

A century ago, farmers in Asia noticed that some rice seedlings in their paddies grew so tall and spindly that they toppled over before they could mature and flower. In 1926, the Japanese plant pathologist E. Kurosawa discovered that a fungus of the genus Gibberella caused this "foolish seedling disease" (FIGURE 39.9). By the 1930s, Japanese scientists had determined that the fungus produced hyperelongation of rice stems by secreting a chemical, which was given the name gibberellin. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that plants also make gibberellins. In the past 40 years, scientists have identified more than 100 different gibberellins that occur naturally in plants, although a much smaller number occur in each plant species. Foolish rice seedlings, it seems, suffer from an overdose of growth regulators normally found in plants in lower concentrations. Gibberellins have a variety of effects in plants.

Fig 39-9. "Foolish seedling disease" in rice. The spindly rice plants on the right are infected with the fungus Gibberella. The pathogen secretes gibberellins, a growth stimulant that uninfected plants (left) also produce, but in smaller quantity.

Stem Elongation.Roots and young leaves are major sites of gibberellin production. Gibberellins stimulate growth in both the leaves and the stem, but they have little effect on root growth. In stems, gibberellins stimulate cell elongation and cell division. Like auxin, gibberellins cause cell wall loosening, but not by acidifying the cell wall. One hypothesis proposes that gibberellins stimulate cell wall loosening enzymes that facilitate the penetration of expansin proteins into the cell wall. Thus, in a growing stem, auxin, by acidifying the cell wall and activating expansins, and gibberellins, by facilitating the penetration of expansins, act in concert to promote elongation.

The effects of gibberellins in enhancing stem elongation are evident when certain dwarf varieties (mutants) of plants are treated with gibberellins. For instance, some dwarf pea plants (including the variety Mendel studied; see Chapter 14) grow to normal height if treated with gibberellins (FIGURE 39.10). If gibberellins are applied to plants of normal size, there is often no response. Apparently, these plants are already producing optimal dose of the hormone.

Fig 39-10. Treating pea dwarfism with a growth hormone. Contrast the untreated dwarf seedlings on the left (control) with the dwarf seedlings on the right, which were treated five days earlier with an application of 5mmg of gibberellin.

The most dramatic example of gibberellin-induced stem elongation is bolting, the rapid growth of the floral stalk. In their vegetative state, some plants, such as cabbage, develop in a rosette form; that is, they are low to the ground with very short internodes. As the plant switches to reproductive growth, a surge of gibberellins induces internodes to elongate rapidly, which elevates the floral buds that develop at the tips of the stems.

Fruit Growth.In many plants, both auxin and gibberellins must be present for fruit to set. The most important commercial application of gibberellins is in the spraying of Thompson seedless grapes (FIGURE 39.11). The hormone makes the individual grapes grow larger, a trait prized by the consumer, and it makes the internodes of the grape bunch elongate, allowing more space for the individual grapes. This increase in space, by enhancing air circulation between the grapes, also makes it harder for yeast and other microorganisms to infect the fruits.

Germination.The embryo of seeds is a rich source of gibberellins. After water is imbibed, the release of gibberellins from the embryo signals the seeds to break dormancy and germinate. Some seeds that require special environmental conditions to germinate, such as exposure to light or cold temperatures, will break dormancy if they are treated with gibberellins. Gibberellins support the growth of cereal seedlings by stimulating the synthesis of digestive enzymes such as a-amylase that mobilize stored nutrients (see FIGURE 38.13).

Abscisic Acid

In the 1960s, one research group studying the chemical changes that precede bud dormancy and another team investigating chemical changes preceding leaf abscission (the dropping of autumn leaves) isolated the same compound, abscisic acid (ABA). Ironically, ABA is no longer thought to play a primary role in either bud dormancy or leaf abscission, but it is a plant hormone of great importance in other functions. Unlike the growth-stimulating hormones we have studied so far--auxin, cytokinins, and gibberellins--ABA generally slows down growth. Often ABA antagonizes the actions of the growth hormones, and it is the ratio of ABA to one or more growth hormones that determines the final physiological outcome. ABA has many effects on plants, but we will consider just two.

Seed Dormancy.Seed dormancy has great survival value because it ensures that the seed will germinate only when there are optimal conditions of light, temperature, and moisture (see Chapter 38). What prevents a seed dispersed in autumn from germinating immediately only to be killed by winter? What mechanisms ensure that such seeds germinate in the spring? For that matter, what prevents seeds from germinating in the dark, moist interior of the fruit? The answer to these questions is ABA. The levels of ABA may increase 100-fold during seed maturation. The high levels of ABA in maturing seeds inhibit germination and induce the production of special proteins that help the seeds withstand the extreme dehydration that accompanies maturation.

Many types of dormant seeds will germinate when ABA is removed or inactivated in some way. The seeds of some desert plants break dormancy only when heavy rains wash ABA out of the seed. Other seeds require light or prolonged exposure to cold to trigger the inactivation of ABA. Often the ratio of ABA to gibberellins determines whether the seed will remain dormant or germinate, and the addition of ABA to seeds that are primed to germinate returns them to the dormant condition. A maize mutant that has seeds that germinate while still on the cob lacks a functional transcription factor required for ABA to induce expression of certain genes (FIGURE 39.12).

Fig 39-12. Precocious germination of mutant maize seeds. Abscisic acid induces dormancy in seeds. When its action is blocked--in this case, by a mutation affecting an abscisic acid-regulated transcription factor--precocious germination results.

Drought Stress.ABA is the primary internal signal that enables plants to withstand drought. When a plant begins to wilt, ABA accumulates in leaves and causes stomata to close rapidly, reducing transpiration and preventing further water loss. ABA, through its effects on second messengers such as calcium, causes an increase in the opening of outwardly directed potassium channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells, leading to a massive loss of potassium from them. The accompanying osmotic loss of water leads to a reduction in guard cell turgor and a decrease in stomatal aperture (see FIGURE 36.13). In some cases, water shortage can stress the root system before the shoot system, and ABA transported from roots to leaves may function as an "early warning system.""Wilty" mutants, which are especially prone to wilting, are in many cases deficient in the production of ABA.

Ethylene

During the 19th century when coal gas was used for street illumination, the leakage of "illuminating gas" from gas mains caused nearby trees to drop their leaves prematurely. In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow demonstrated that the gas ethylene was the active factor in "illuminating gas." The idea that ethylene is a hormone that plants themselves produce only became widely accepted, however, when the advent of a technique called gas chromatography simplified the quantitative measurement of ethylene. Plants produce ethylene in response to stresses such as drought, flooding, mechanical pressure, injury, and infection. Ethylene production also occurs during fruit ripening and during programmed cell death. And ethylene is also produced in response to high concentrations of externally applied auxin. Indeed, many physiological effects previously ascribed to auxin, such as inhibition of root elongation, are now thought to be due to auxin-induced ethylene production. Ethylene has numerous effects on plants, but we shall focus on just four.

The Triple Response to Mechanical Stress: Using Mutants to Dissect a Signal-Transduction Pathway.Imagine a pea seedling pushing upward through the soil only to come up against the underside of an immovable object such as a stone. As the stem pushes against the obstacle, the mechanical stress in its delicate tip induces the seedling to start producing ethylene. Ethylene, in turn, instigates the seedling to perform a growth maneuver called the triple response that enables it to circumvent the obstacle. The three parts of this response, which you can see in FIGURE 39.13, are a slowing of stem elongation, a thickening of the stem (which makes it stronger), and a curvature that causes the stem to start growing horizontally. As the stem continues to grow, its tip touches upward intermittently. If these probings continue to detect a solid object above, then another pulse of ethylene is generated and the stem continues its horizontal progress. If, however, the upward touch detects no solid object, then ethylene production decreases, and the stem, now clear of the obstacle, resumes its normal upward growth.

Fig 39-13. Ethylene induces the triple response in pea seedlings. Either artificial treatment with the gaseous hormone ethylene or natural production of the hormone triggered by mechanical stress causes the stems of germinating pea seedlings to elongate less rapidly, to become thicker, and to grow horizontally--the triple response. This growth response is an adaptation that helps the seedling circumvent obstacles encountered during soil penetration. This experiment shows the extent of the triple response in pea seedlings treated with different concentrations of ethylene.

It is ethylene that induces the stem to grow horizontally rather than the physical obstruction per se; when ethylene is applied to normal seedlings growing free of all physical impediments, they undergo the triple response (see FIGURE 39.13).

Researchers have studied Arabidopsis mutants with abnormal triple responses to investigate the signal transduction pathways for the response. Ethylene-insensitive (ein) mutants fail to undergo the triple response after exposure to ethylene (FIGURE 39.14a). Some types of ein mutants are insensitive to the presence of ethylene because they lack a functional ethylene receptor. Other mutants undergo the triple response even out of soil, in the air, where there are no physical obstacles. Some mutants of this type have a regulatory defect that causes them to produce ethylene at rates 20 times normal. The phenotype of such ethylene-overproducing (eto) mutants can be restored to wild-type by treating the seedlings with inhibitors of ethylene synthesis. Still other mutants, called constitutive triple-response (ctr) mutants, undergo the triple response in air but do not respond to inhibitors of ethylene synthesis (FIGURE 39.14b). In this case, ethylene signal transduction is permanently turned on even though there is no ethylene present. FIGURE 39.15 summarizes the responses of ein, eto, and ctr mutants to ethylene and ethylene synthesis inhibitors.

Fig 39-15. Ethylene signal-transduction mutants can be distinguished by their different responses to experimental treatments.

The affected gene in ctr mutants turns out to code for a protein kinase. The fact that this mutation activates the ethylene response suggests that the normal kinase product of the wild-type allele is a negative regulator of ethylene signal transduction. Here is one hypothesis for how the pathway works in wild-type plants: Binding of the hormone ethylene to the ethylene receptor leads to inactivation of the kinase; and inactivation of this negative regulator allows synthesis of the proteins required for the triple response.

Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death.Consider the shedding of a leaf in autumn or the death of an annual after flowering. Or think about the final step in the differentiation of a xylem vessel element, when its living contents are destroyed, leaving a hollow tube behind. All of these events involve the programmed death of certain cells or organs, or of the entire plant. The cells, organs and plants that are genetically programmed to die on a particular schedule do not simply shut down their cellular machinery and await death. Rather, the onset of programmed cell death, called apoptosis, is one of the busiest times in a cell's life, requiring new gene expression. During apoptosis, newly formed enzymes break down many chemical components, including chlorophyll, DNA, RNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. The plant may salvage the breakdown products. A burst of ethylene is almost always associated with this programmed destruction of cells, organs, or the whole plant.

Leaf Abscission.The loss of leaves each autumn is an adaptation that keeps deciduous trees from desiccating during winter when the roots cannot absorb water from the frozen ground. Before leaves abscise, many essential elements are salvaged from the dying leaves and are stored in stem parenchyma cells. These nutrients are recycled back to developing leaves the following spring. Fall color is a combination of new red pigments made during autumn and yellow and orange carotenoids (see Chapter 10) that were already present in the leaf but are rendered visible by the breakdown of the dark green chlorophyll in autumn.

When an autumn leaf falls, the breaking point is an abscission layer located near the base of the petiole. The small parenchyma cells of this layer have very thin walls, and there are no fiber cells around the vascular tissue. The abscission layer is further weakened when enzymes hydrolyze polysaccharides in the cell walls. Finally, the weight of the leaf, with the help of wind, causes a separation within the abscission layer. Even before the leaf falls, a layer of cork forms a protective scar on the twig's side of the abscission layer, preventing pathogens from invading the plant (FIGURE 39.16).

Fig 39-16. Abscission of a maple leaf. Abscission is controlled by a change in the balance of ethylene and auxin. The abscission layer can be seen here as a vertical band at the base of the petiole. After the leaf falls, a protective layer of cork becomes the leaf scar that helps prevent pathogens from invading the plant (LM).

A change in the balance of ethylene and auxin controls abscission. An aging leaf produces less and less auxin and this makes the cells of the abscission layer more sensitive to ethylene. As the influence of ethylene on the abscission layer prevails, the cells produce enzymes that digest the cellulose and other components of cell walls.

Fruit Ripening.Fruits help disperse the seeds of flowering plants (see Chapter 30). Immature (unripe) fruits that are tart, hard, and green become edible at the time of seed maturation. A burst of ethylene production in the fruit triggers this ripening. Enzymatic breakdown of cell wall components softens the fruit, and the conversion of starches and acids to sugars makes the fruit sweet. The production of new scents and colors helps advertise fruits' ripeness to animals, who eat the fruits and disperse the seeds.

A chain reaction occurs during ripening: ethylene triggers ripening, and ripening, in turn, triggers even more ethylene production--one of the rare examples of positive feedback in physiology (see FIGURE 1.8). The result is a huge burst in ethylene production. Because ethylene is a gas, the signal to ripen even spreads from fruit to fruit: One bad apple, in fact, does spoil the lot. If you pick or buy green fruit, you may be able to speed ripening by storing the fruit in a plastic bag, so that ethylene gas will accumulate. On a commercial scale, many kinds of fruit are ripened in huge storage containers in which ethylene levels are enhanced. In other cases, measures are taken to retard ripening caused by natural ethylene. Apples, for instance, are stored in bins flushed with carbon dioxide. Circulating the air prevents ethylene from accumulating, and carbon dioxide inhibits synthesis of new ethylene. Stored in this way, apples picked in autumn can still be shipped to grocery stores the following summer.

Given the importance of ethylene in the post-harvest physiology of fruits, the genetic engineering of ethylene signal transduction pathways has potentially important commercial applications. For example, molecular biologists, by adding an antisense RNA that blocks the transcription of one of the genes required for ethylene synthesis, have created tomato fruits that ripen on demand. These fruits are picked while green and will not ripen unless ethylene gas is added. As such methods are refined, they will reduce spoilage of fruits and vegetables, a problem that currently ruins almost half the produce harvested in the United States.

Brassinosteroids

First isolated from Brassica pollen in 1979, brassinosteroids are steroids chemically similar to cholesterol and the sex hormones of animals. Brassinosteroids induce cell elongation and division in stem segments and seedlings at concentrations as low as 10-12M. They also retard leaf abscission and promote xylem differentiation. These effects are so qualitatively similar to those of auxin that it took several years for plant physiologists to accept brassinosteroids as nonauxin hormones.

It was evidence from molecular biology that established brassinosteroids as plant hormones. Joanne Chory, our interviewee on pages 718-719, and her colleagues at the Salk Institute in San Diego were interested in Arabidopsis mutants that had morphological features similar to light-grown plants even though they were grown in the dark. The researchers discovered that the mutation affects a gene that normally codes for an enzyme similar to one involved in steroid synthesis in mammalian cells. The researchers also showed that the mutant plants could be restored to normal phenotype by the experimental application of brassinosteroids. The mutant studied by Chory was brassinosteroid-deficient.

As we conclude our survey of plant hormones, it is important to remember that these chemical signals are components of control systems that tune a plant's growth, development, reproduction, and physiology to the environment. For example, you learned that auxin functions in the phototropic bending of shoots toward light; that abscisic acid "holds" certain seeds dormant until the environment is suitable for germination; and that ethylene functions in leaf abscission as shorter days and cooler temperatures announce autumn. Such relationships between outside stimuli and hormonal signals are important to keep in mind as we examine how plants actually detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.





 Blue-light photoreceptors are a heterogeneous group of pigments

The action spectra of many plant processes, including phototropism (the bending toward or away from light), the light-induced slowing of hypocotyl elongation when a seedling breaks ground during germination (see FIGURE 38.14), and the light-induced opening of stomata (see FIGURE 36.13), show that blue light is most effective in initiating these diverse responses. (FIGURE 39.17 illustrates phototropism as an example.) The biochemical identity of the blue-light photoreceptor was so elusive that in the 1970s plant physiologists began to refer to this putative receptor as cryptochrome (from the Greek kryptos, hidden, and chrom, pigment). In the 1990s, molecular biologists analyzing Arabidopsis mutants found that plants actually use at least three completely different types of pigments to detect blue light: cryptochromes (for the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation), phototropin (for phototropism), and a carotenoid-based photoreceptor called zeaxanthin (for stomatal opening).

In this action spectrum for phototropism in maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles, you can see that only light of wavelengths below 500 nm (blue and ultraviolet) are effective in inducing curvature. (b) The upper photograph in each pair was taken at the beginning of the experiment; the lower photos were taken after a 90-minute exposure to side lighting of the indicated colors.





 Phytochromes function as photoreceptors in many plant responses to light

When we introduced signal transduction in plants earlier in the chapter, we discussed the role of a family of plant pigments called phytochromes in the greening process. Phytochromes regulate many of a plant's responses to light throughout its life from seed to flower. Let's look at a couple of examples.

The Phytochrome Switch and Seed Germination

It was studies of seed germination that led to the discovery of phytochromes. Because of their limited food reserves, the successful sprouting of many types of small seeds, such as lettuce, requires that they germinate only when conditions, especially the light environment, are near optimal. Such seeds often remain dormant for many years until a change in light conditions. For example, the death of a shading tree or the plowing of a field may create a favorable light environment for germination.

In the 1930s, scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture determined the action spectrum for light-induced germination of lettuce seeds. They exposed water-swollen seeds to a few minutes of monochromatic (single-colored) light of various wavelengths and then stored the seeds in the dark. After two days, the researchers scored the number of seeds that had germinated under each light regimen. The action spectrum revealed that red light of 660 nm wavelength increases the germination percentage of lettuce seeds the most compared to control seeds that had not been exposed to any light. In marked contrast, far-red light, that is light of wavelengths just near the edge of human visibility (730 nm), inhibits lettuce seed germination compared to the dark controls. What happens when the lettuce seeds are subjected to a flash of red (R) light followed by a flash of far-red (FR) light or, conversely, to FR light followed by R light? The answer is that the last flash of light determines the seeds' response (FIGURE 39.18). In other words, the effects of red and far-red light are reversible.

Fig 39-18. Phytochrome regulation of lettuce seed germination. The control seeds, on the left, were kept in the dark. The various batches of experimental seeds received flashes of light. The bars below the photos indicate the sequences of red and far-red light flashes.

The photoreceptor responsible for these opposing effects of red and far-red light is a phytochrome. It consists of a protein covalently bonded to a nonprotein part that functions as a chromophore, the light-absorbing part of the molecule (FIGURE 39.19). So far, researchers have identified five different phytochromes in Arabidopsis, each with a slightly different protein component.

Fig 39-19. Structure of a phytochrome.

The chromophore of a phytochrome reverts back and forth between two isomeric forms (see Chapter 4 to review isomers). One isomer absorbs red light, and the other absorbs far-red light. The two variations of phytochrome--Pr (red absorbing) and Pfr (far-red absorbing)--are said to be photoreversible: 

This Pr Pfr interconversion acts as a switching mechanism that controls various light-induced events in the life of the plant (FIGURE 39.20). Pfr is the form of phytochrome that triggers many of a plant's developmental responses to light. For example, in the seed germination experiments we just described, Pr in the lettuce seeds that were exposed to red light was converted to Pfr, stimulating the cellular responses that lead to germination. When the red-illuminated seeds were then exposed to far-red light, the Pfr was converted back to Pr, inhibiting the germination response.

Fig 39-20. Phytochrome: a molecular switching mechanism. Absorption of red light causes the bluish Pr to change to the blue-greenish Pfr. Far-red light reverses this conversion. In most cases, it is the Pfr form of the pigment that switches on physiological and developmental responses in the plan

How does phytochrome switching explain light-induced germination in nature? Plants synthesize phytochrome as Pr, and if seeds are kept in the dark the pigment remains almost entirely in the Pr form (FIGURE 39.20). But if the seeds are illuminated with sunlight, the phytochrome is exposed to red light (along with all the other wavelengths in sunlight), and much of the Pr is converted to Pfr. This appearance of Pfr is one of the ways that plants detect sunlight. When seeds are exposed to adequate sunlight for the first time, it is the appearance of Pfr that triggers their germination.

The Phytochrome Switch and Shade Avoidance

The phytochrome system also provides the plant with information about the quality of light. Sunlight includes both red and far-red radiation. Thus, during the day the Pr Pfr photoreversion reaches a dynamic equilibrium, with the ratio of the two phytochrome forms indicating the relative amounts of red and far-red light. This sensing mechanism enables plants to adapt to changes in light conditions. Consider, for example, the "shade-avoidance" response of a tree that requires relatively high light intensity. If other trees in a forest shade this tree, the phytochrome ratio shifts in favor of Pr because the forest canopy screens out more red light than far-red light. (This is because the chlorophyll pigments in the leaves of the canopy absorb red light and allow far-red light to pass.) This shift in the ratio of red to far-red light induces the tree to allocate more of its resources to growing taller. In contrast, direct sunlight increases the proportion of Pfr, which stimulates branching and inhibits vertical growth.

In addition to enabling plants to detect light and distinguish its quality, phytochromes also function in a plant's ability to keep track of the passage of days and seasons. To understand phytochrome's role in these timekeeping processes, we must first examine the clock itself.





 Biological clocks control circadian rhythms in plants and other eukaryotes

Many plant processes, such as transpiration and synthesis of certain enzymes, oscillate during the course of a day. Some of these cyclic variations are responses to the changes in light levels, temperature, and relative humidity that accompany the 24-hour cycle of day and night. However, one can eliminate these exogenous (external) factors by growing plants in growth chambers under rigidly maintained conditions of light, temperature, and humidity. Even under these artificially constant conditions, many physiological processes in plants, such as the opening and closing of stomata and the production of photosynthetic enzymes, continue to oscillate with a frequency of about 24 hours. For example, many legumes lower their leaves in the evening and raise them in the morning (FIGURE 39.21). A bean plant will continue these "sleep movements" even if kept in constant light or constant darkness; the leaves are not simply responding to sunrise and sunset. Such physiological cycles with a frequency of about 24-hours and that are not directly paced by any known environmental variable are called circadian rhythms (from the Latin circa, approximately, and dies, day). Circadian rhythms are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic life. For example, your pulse, blood pressure, temperature, rate of cell division, blood cell count, alertness, urine composition, metabolic rate, sex drive, and responsiveness to medications all fluctuate in a circadian manner.

Fig 39-21. Sleep movements of a bean plant. Leaf position at noon (top) and at midnight. The movements are caused by reversible changes in the turgor pressure of cells on opposing sides of the pulvini, swollen regions of the petiole.

Are circadian rhythms truly prompted by an internal clock, or are they merely daily responses to some subtle but pervasive environmental cycle, such as geomagnetism or cosmic radiation? Organisms, including plants and humans, continue their rhythms when placed in the deepest mine shafts or when orbited in satellites, conditions that alter these subtle geophysical periodicities. All research thus far indicates that the oscillator for circadian rhythms is endogenous (internal). This internal clock, however, is entrained (set) to a period of precisely 24 hours by daily signals from the environment.

If an organism is kept in a constant environment, its circadian rhythms deviate from a 24-hour period (a "period" is the duration of one cycle). These free-running periods, as they are called, vary from about 21 to 27 hours, depending on the particular rhythmic response. The sleep movements of bean plants, for instance, have a period of 26 hours when the plants are kept under the free-running conditions of constant darkness. Deviation of the free-running period from exactly 24 hours does not mean that biological clocks drift erratically. Free-running clocks are still keeping perfect time, but they are not synchronized with the outside world.

How do biological clocks work? In attempting to answer this question, we must be careful to differentiate between the oscillator (clock) and the rhythmic processes it controls. The sweeping leaves of sleep movements are the "hands" of the biological clock, but these movements are not the essence of the clockwork itself. If the leaves of a bean plant are restrained for several hours so they cannot move, they will, on release, rush to the position appropriate for the time of day. We can interfere with a biological rhythm, but the clockwork goes right on ticking off the time.

Researchers are tracing the clock to a molecular mechanism that may be common to all eukaryotes. A leading hypothesis is that biological timekeeping may depend on synthesis of a protein that regulates its own production through feedback control. This protein may be a transcription factor that inhibits transcription of the gene that encodes for the transcription factor itself. The concentration of this transcription factor may accumulate during the first half of the circadian cycle, and then decline during the second half, due to self-inhibition of its own production.

Researchers have recently used a novel technique to identify clock mutants of Arabidopsis. One prominent circadian rhythm in plants is the daily production of certain photosynthesis-related proteins. Molecular biologists traced this rhythm to the promoter that regulates the transcription of the genes for these photosynthesis proteins. To identify clock mutants, scientists spliced the gene for an enzyme called luciferase to the promoter. Luciferase is the enzyme responsible for the bioluminescence of fireflies. When the biological clock turned on the promoter in the Arabidopsis genome, it also turned on the production of luciferase. The plants began to glow with a circadian periodicity. Clock mutants were then isolated by selecting specimens that glowed for a longer or shorter time than normal. The defective genes in some of these mutants affect proteins that normally bind photoreceptors. Perhaps these particular mutations disrupt a light-dependent mechanism that sets the biological clock.





 Light entrains the biological clock

As we have discussed, the free running period of the circadian rhythm of bean leaf movements is 26 hours. Consider a bean plant placed at dawn in a dark cabinet for 72 hours: Its leaves would not rise again until 2 hours after natural dawn on the second day, and 4 hours after natural dawn on the third day, and so on. Shut off from environmental cues, the plant then becomes desynchronized with its natural environment. Desynchronization also happens when we cross several time zones in an airplane; when we reach our destination, the clocks on the wall are not synchronized with our internal clocks. All eukaryotes are probably prone to jetlag.

What entrains the biological clock to precisely 24 hours every day? The answer is light. Both phytochrome and blue-light photoreceptors can entrain circadian rhythms in plants, but our understanding of how phytochrome does this is more complete. As you might suspect, the mechanism involves turning cellular responses on and off by means of the Pr Pfr switch.

Consider once again the photoreversible system diagrammed in FIGURE 39.20. In darkness, the phytochrome ratio shifts gradually in favor of the Pr form. This is partly due to turnover in the overall phytochrome pool. The pigment is synthesized in the Pr form, and degradative enzymes destroy more Pfr than Pr. In addition, in some plant species, Pfr present at sundown slowly converts to Pr by a biochemical mechanism. In darkness, there is no means for the accumulating Pr to be reconverted to Pfr, but when the sun rises, the Pfr level suddenly increases again by rapid photochemical conversion from Pr. It is this sudden increase in Pfr each day at dawn that resets the biological clock: bean leaves always reach their most extreme night position 16 hours after dawn.

Interactions between phytochrome and the biological clock enable plants to measure the passage of night and day in nature. The relative lengths of night and day, however, change over the course of the year (except at the Equator). Plants use this change to mark the passage of seasons.





 Photoperiodism synchronizes many plant responses to changes of season

Imagine the consequences if a plant produced flowers when its insect pollinators were not present or if a deciduous tree produced leaves in the middle of winter. Seasonal events are of critical importance in the life cycles of most plants. Seed germination, flowering, and the onset and breaking of bud dormancy are examples of stages in plant development that usually occur at specific times of the year. The environmental stimulus plants use most often to detect the time of year is the photoperiod, the relative lengths of night and day. A physiological response to photoperiod, such as flowering, is called photoperiodism.

Photoperiodism and the Control of Flowering

One of the earliest clues to how plants detect the progression of seasons came from a mutant variety of tobacco studied by W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard in 1920. This variety, named Maryland Mammoth, grew exceptionally tall but failed to flower during summer, when normal tobacco plants flowered. Maryland Mammoth finally bloomed in a greenhouse in December. After trying to induce earlier flowering by varying temperature, moisture, and mineral nutrition, Garner and Allard learned that it was the shortening days of winter that stimulated Maryland Mammoth to flower. If the plants were kept in light-tight boxes so that lamps could be used to manipulate durations of "day" and "night," flowering occurred only if the day length was 14 hours or shorter. Maryland Mammoth did not flower during summer because, at Maryland's latitude, the days were too long during that season.

Garner and Allard termed Maryland Mammoth a short-day plant, because it apparently required a light period shorter than a critical length to flower. Chrysanthemums, poinsettias, and some soybean varieties are a few of the other short-day plants, which generally flower in late summer, fall, or winter. Another group of plants dependent on photoperiod will flower only when the light period is longer than a certain number of hours. These long-day plants generally flower in late spring or early summer. Spinach, for example, flowers when days are 14 hours or longer. Radish, lettuce, iris, and many cereal varieties are also long-day plants. Flowering in a third group, day-neutral plants, is unaffected by photoperiod. Tomatoes, rice, and dandelions are examples of day-neutral plants, which flower when they reach a certain stage of maturity, regardless of day length at that time.

Critical Night Length.In the 1940s, researchers discovered that it is actually night length, not day length, that controls flowering and other responses to photoperiod. Many of these scientists worked with cocklebur, a short-day plant that flowers only when days are 16 hours or shorter (and nights are at least 8 hours long). These researchers found that if the daytime portion of the photoperiod is broken by a brief exposure to darkness, there is no effect on flowering. However, if the nighttime part of the photoperiod is interrupted by even a few minutes of dim light, cocklebur will not flower, and this turned out to be true for other short-day plants as well (FIGURE 39.22a, p. 822). Cocklebur is actually unresponsive to day length, but it requires at least 8 hours of continuous darkness to flower. Short-day plants are really long-night plants, but the older term is embedded firmly in the jargon of plant physiology. Similarly, long-day plants are actually short-night plants. A long-day plant grown on photoperiods of long nights that would not normally induce flowering will flower if the period of continuous darkness is interrupted by a few minutes of light (FIGURE 39.22b, p. 822). Notice that we distinguish long-day from short-day plants not by an absolute night length but by whether the critical night length sets a maximum (long-day plants) or minimum (short-day plants) number of hours of darkness required for flowering. In both cases, the actual number of hours in the critical night length is specific to each species of plant.

Red light is the most effective color in interrupting the nighttime portion of the photoperiod. Action spectra and photoreversibility experiments show that phytochrome is the pigment that receives the red light (FIGURE 39.23). For example, if a flash of red light (R) during the dark period is followed immediately by a flash of far-red (FR) light, then the plant detects no interruption of night length. As in the case of phytochrome-mediated seed germination, red/far-red photoreversibility can be demonstrated.

Plants measure night length very accurately; some short-day plants will not flower if night is even one minute shorter than the critical length. Some plant species always flower on the same day each year. It appears that plants use their biological clock, apparently entrained with the help of phytochrome, to tell the season of the year by measuring night length. The floriculture (flower-growing) industry has applied this knowledge to produce flowers out of season. Chrysanthemums, for instance, are short-day plants that normally bloom in fall, but their blooming can be stalled until Mother's Day in May by punctuating each long night with a flash of light, thus turning one long night into two short nights.

Some plants bloom after a single exposure to the photoperiod required for flowering. Other species need several successive days of the appropriate photoperiod. Still other plants will respond to a photoperiod only if they have been previously exposed to some other environmental stimulus, such as a period of cold temperatures. Winter wheat, for example, will not flower unless it has been exposed to several weeks of temperatures below 10&#176;C. This requirement for pretreatment with cold before flowering is called vernalization. Several weeks after winter wheat is vernalized, a photoperiod with long days (short nights) induces flowering.

Is There a Flowering Hormone?

Buds produce flowers, but it is leaves that detect photoperiod. When the photoperiodic requirement for flowering is met, leaves must send a signal to the buds cuing them to develop as flowers. To induce a short-day plant or long-day plant to flower, it is enough in many species to expose a single leaf to the appropriate photoperiod. Indeed, if only one leaf is left attached to the plant, photoperiod is detected and floral buds are induced. If all leaves are removed, however, the plant is blind to photoperiod. Most plant physiologists believe the flowering signal is a hormone or some change in the relative concentrations of two or more hormones (FIGURE 39.24). The flowering stimulus appears to be the same for short-day and long-day plants, despite the difference in the photoperiodic conditions required for their leaves to send this signal. The evidence for hormonal regulation of flowering is compelling, but researchers have not yet identified the hormone(s).

Fig 39-24. Experimental evidence for a flowering hormone(s). If a plant that has been induced to flower by photoperiod is grafted to a plant that has not been induced, both plants flower, indicating the transmission of a flower-inducing substance. This works in some cases even if one is a short-day plant and the other is a long-day plant.

Meristem Transition from Vegetative Growth to Flowering

Whatever combination of environmental cues (such as photoperiod or vernilization) and internal signals (such as hormones) is necessary for flowering to occur, the outcome is the transition of a bud's meristem from a vegetative state to a flowering state. This transition requires changes in the expression of genes that regulate pattern formation. Meristem-identity genes that specify that the bud will now form a flower instead of a vegetative shoot must first be switched on. Then the organ-identity genes that specify the spatial organization of the floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--are activated in the appropriate regions of the meristem (see FIGURES 21.19 and 35.12). Research on flower development is progressing rapidly, and one goal is to identify the signal-transduction pathways that link such cues as photoperiod and hormonal changes to the gene expression required for flowering.





 Plants respond to environmental stimuli through a combination of developmental and physiological mechanisms

Responses to Gravity

Since plants are solar-powered organisms, it is not surprising that mechanisms for growing toward sunlight have evolved. But what environmental cue does the shoot of a young seedling use to grow upward when it is completely underground and there is no light for it to detect? Similarly, what environmental factor prompts the young root to grow downward? The answer to both questions is gravity.

Place a seedling on its side, and it will adjust its growth so that the shoot bends upward and the root curves downward. In their responses to gravity, or gravitropism, roots display positive gravitropism and shoots exhibit negative gravitropism. Gravitropism functions as soon as a seed germinates, ensuring that the root grows into the soil and the shoot reaches sunlight regardless of how the seed happens to be oriented when it lands. Auxin plays a major role in gravitropic responses.

Plants may tell up from down by the settling of statoliths, specialized plastids containing dense starch grains, to the lower portions of cells (FIGURE 39.25). In roots, statoliths are located in certain cells of the root cap. According to one hypothesis, the aggregation of statoliths at the low points of these cells triggers the redistribution of calcium, which in turn causes lateral transport of auxin within the root. The calcium and auxin accumulate on the lower side of the root's zone of elongation. (Because these chemicals are dissolved, they do not respond to gravity but must be actively transported to one side of the root.) At high concentration, auxin inhibits cell elongation, an effect that slows growth on the lower side of the root. The more rapid elongation of cells on the upper side causes the root to curve as it grows. This tropism continues until the root is growing straight down.

Fig 39-25. The statolith hypothesis for root gravitropism. These corn roots were placed on their sides and photographed before (top) and 1.5 hours after initiation of the gravitropic response. The light micrographs show the locations of statoliths, modified plastids, within cells of the root cap. The settling of statoliths to the low points of these cells may be a gravity-sensing mechanism that leads to the redistribution of auxin and the differential rates of elongation by cells on opposite sides of the root

Plant physiologists are refining the "falling statolith" hypothesis of root gravitropism as they try new experiments. For example, mutants of Arabidopsis and tobacco that lack statoliths are still capable of gravitropism, though the response is slower than in wild-type plants. It could be that the entire cell helps the root sense gravity by mechanically pulling on proteins that tether the protoplast to the cell wall, stretching the proteins on the "up" side and compressing the proteins on the "down" side of the root cells. Dense organelles (in addition to starch granules) may also contribute by distorting the cytoskeleton as they are pulled by gravity. Statoliths, because of their density, may enhance gravitational sensing by a mechanism that works more slowly in their absence.

Responses to Mechanical Stimuli

A tree growing on a windy mountain ridge will usually have a shorter, stockier trunk than a tree of the same species growing in a more sheltered location. The advantage of this stunting of growth is that it enables the plant to hold its ground against strong gusts of wind. The term thigmomorphogenesis (from the Greek thigma, touch) refers to the changes in form that result from mechanical perturbation. Plants are very sensitive to mechanical stress: Some researchers have found that even the act of measuring the length of a leaf with a ruler alters its subsequent growth.

Rubbing the stems of a young plant a few times results in plants that are shorter than controls (FIGURE 39.26). Mechanical stimulation activates a signal-transduction pathway involving an increase in cytoplasmic calcium that, in turn, mediates the activation of specific genes, some of which encode for proteins that affect cell wall properties.

Fig 39-26. Altering gene expression by touch in Arabidopsis. The shorter plant on the left was touched twice a day. The unmolested plant (right) grew much taller.

Some plant species have become, over the course of their evolution, "touch specialists." Acute responsiveness to mechanical stimuli is an integral part of these plants' life "strategies." Most vines and other climbing plants have tendrils that coil rapidly around supports (see FIGURE 35.6a). These grasping organs usually grow straight until they touch something; the contact stimulates a coiling response caused by differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the tendril. This directional growth in response to touch is called thigmotropism, and it allows the vines to take advantage of whatever mechanical supports it comes across as it climbs upward toward a forest canopy.

Other examples of touch specialists are plants that undergo rapid leaf movements in response to mechanical stimulation. For example, when the compound leaf of the sensitive plant Mimosa is touched, it collapses and its leaflets fold together (FIGURE 39.27). This response, which takes only a second or two, results from a rapid loss of turgor by cells within pulvini, specialized motor organs located at the joints of the leaf. The motor cells suddenly become flaccid after stimulation because they lose potassium, which causes water to leave the cells by osmosis. It takes about ten minutes for the cells to regain their turgor and restore the "unstimulated" form of the leaf. The function of the sensitive plant's behavior invites speculation. Perhaps by folding its leaves and reducing its surface area when jostled by strong winds, the plant conserves water. Or perhaps because the collapse of the leaves exposes thorns on the stem, the rapid response of the sensitive plant discourages herbivores.

Fig 39-27. Rapid turgor movements by the sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica). (a) In the unstimulated plant, leaflets are spread apart. (b) Within a second or two of being touched, the leaflets have folded together. (c) In these light micrographs of a leaflet pair in the closed (stimulated) state, you can see the motor cells in the sectioned pulvini (motor organs). The curvature of a pulvinus is caused by motor cells on one side losing water and becoming flaccid while cells on the opposite side retain their turgor.

A remarkable feature of rapid leaf movements is the mode of transmission of the stimulus through the plant. If one leaflet on a sensitive plant is touched, first that leaflet responds, then the adjacent leaflet responds, and so on until all the leaflet-pairs have folded together. From the point of stimulation, the signal that produces this response travels at a speed of about a centimeter per second. Traveling at the the same rate, an electrical impulse can be detected by attaching electrodes to the leaf. These impulses, called action potentials, resemble nervous-system messages in animals, though the action potentials of plants are thousands of times slower. Action potentials, which have been discovered in many species of algae and plants, may be widely used as a form of internal communication. Another example is the Venus flytrap, in which action potentials are transmitted from sensory hairs in the trap to the cells that respond by closing the trap (see FIGURE 37.16a). In the case of Mimosa, more violent stimuli, such as touching a leaf with a hot needle, causes all the leaves and leaflets on a plant to droop, but this systemic response involves the spread of chemical signals released from the injured area to other parts of the shoot.

Responses to Stress

Occasionally, factors in the environment change severely enough to have a potentially adverse effect on a plant's survival, growth, and reproduction. Environmental stresses, such as flooding, drought, or extreme temperatures can have a devastating impact on crop yields in agriculture. In natural ecosystems, plants that cannot tolerate an environmental stress will either succumb or be outcompeted by other plants, and they will become locally extinct. Thus, environmental stresses are also important in determining the geographic ranges of plants. Here, we consider some of the more common abiotic (nonliving) stresses that plants encounter. In the next section, we will examine the defensive responses of plants to common biotic (biological) stresses such as pathogens and herbivores.

Drought.On a bright, warm, dry day, a plant may be stressed by a water deficiency because it is losing water by transpiration faster than the water can be restored by uptake from the soil. Prolonged drought can stress crops and the plants of natural ecosystems for weeks or months. Severe water deficit, of course, will kill a plant, as you may know from experience with neglected houseplants. But plants have control systems that enable them to cope with less extreme water deficits.

Many of a plant's responses to water deficit help the plant conserve water by reducing the rate of transpiration. Water deficit in a leaf causes guard cells to lose turgor, a simple control mechanism that slows transpiration by closing stomata (see Chapter 36). Water deficit also stimulates increased synthesis and release of abscisic acid in the leaf, and this hormone helps keep stomata closed by acting on guard cell membranes. Leaves respond to water deficit in several other ways. Because cell expansion is a turgor-dependent process, a water deficit will inhibit the growth (expansion) of young leaves. This response minimizes the transpirational loss of water by slowing the increase in leaf surface. When the leaves of many grasses and other plants wilt from a water deficit, they roll into a shape that reduces transpiration by exposing less leaf surface to dry air and wind. While all of these responses of leaves help the plant conserve water, they also reduce photosynthesis. This is one reason a drought diminishes crop yield.

Root growth also responds to water deficit. During a drought, the soil usually dries from the surface down. This inhibits the growth of shallow roots, partly because cells cannot maintain the turgor required for elongation. Deeper roots surrounded by soil that is still moist continue to grow. Thus, the root system proliferates in a way that maximizes exposure to soil water.

Flooding.An overwatered houseplant may suffocate because the soil lacks the air spaces that provide oxygen for cellular respiration in the roots. Some plants are structurally adapted to very wet habitats. For example, the submerged roots of trees called mangroves, which inhabit coastal marshes, are continuous with aerial roots that provide access to oxygen. But how do plants less specialized for aquatic environments cope with oxygen deprivation in waterlogged soils? Oxygen deprivation stimulates the production of the hormone ethylene, which causes some of the cells in the root cortex to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death). Enzymatic destruction of cells creates air tubes that function as "snorkels," providing oxygen to the submerged roots (FIGURE 39.28).

(b) An experimental root grown in a nonaerated hydroponic medium. Ethylene-stimulated apoptosis (programmed cell death) creates the air tubes.

Salt Stress.An excess of sodium chloride or other salts in the soil threatens plants for two reasons. First, by lowering the water potential of the soil solution, salt can cause a water deficit in plants even though the soil has plenty of water. This is because in an environment with a water potential more negative than that of the root tissue, roots will lose water rather than absorb it (see Chapter 36). The second problem with saline soil is that sodium and certain other ions are toxic to plants when their concentrations are relatively high. The selectively permeable membranes of root cells impede the uptake of most harmful ions, but this only aggravates the problem of acquiring water from soil that is rich in solutes. Many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing compatible solutes, organic compounds that keep the water potential of cells more negative than that of the soil solution without admitting toxic quantities of salt. However, most plants cannot survive salt stress for long. The exceptions are halophytes, salt-tolerant plants with adaptations such as salt glands. These glands pump salts out across the leaf epidermis.

Heat Stress.Excessive heat can harm and eventually kill a plant by denaturing its enzymes and damaging its metabolism in other ways. One function of transpiration is evaporative cooling. On a warm day, for example, the temperature of a leaf may be 3-10&#176;C below ambient air temperature. Of course, hot, dry weather also tends to cause water deficiency in many plants; the closing of stomata in response to this stress conserves water but sacrifices evaporative cooling. This dilemma is one of the reasons that very hot, dry days take such a toll on most plants.

Most plants have a backup response that enables them to survive heat stress. Above a certain temperature--about 40&#176;C for most plants that inhabit temperate regions--plant cells begin synthesizing relatively large quantities of special proteins called heat-shock proteins. Researchers have also discovered this response in heat-stressed animals and microorganisms. Some heat-shock proteins are identical to chaperone proteins, which function in unstressed cells as temporary scaffolds that help other proteins fold into their functional shapes (see Chapter 5). In their roles as heat-shock proteins, perhaps these molecules embrace enzymes and other proteins and help prevent denaturation.

Cold Stress.One problem plants face when the temperature of the environment falls is a change in the fluidity of cell membranes. Recall from Chapter 8 that a biological membrane is a fluid mosaic, with proteins and lipids moving laterally in the plane of the membrane. When a membrane cools below a critical point, it loses its fluidity as the lipids become locked into crystalline structures. This alters solute transport across the membrane and also adversely affects the functions of membrane proteins. Plants respond to cold stress by altering the lipid composition of their membranes. For example, membrane lipids increase in their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which have shapes that help keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures by impeding crystal formation (see FIGURE 8.4b). Such molecular modification of the membrane requires from several hours to days, which is one reason rapid chilling is generally more stressful to plants than the more gradual drop in air temperature that occurs seasonally.

Freezing is a more severe version of cold stress. At subfreezing temperatures, ice forms in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of most plants. (The cytosol generally does not freeze at the cooling rates encountered in nature because it contains more solutes than the very dilute solution found in the cell wall--solutes depress the freezing point of a solution.) The reduction in liquid water in the cell wall caused by ice formation lowers the extracellular water potential, causing water to leave the cytoplasm. The resulting increase in the concentration of ionic salts in the cytoplasm is harmful and can lead to cell death. Whether the cell survives depends to a large extent on how resistant it is to dehydration. Plants native to regions where winters are cold have special adaptations that enable them to cope with freezing stress. For example, before the onset of winter, the cells of many frost-tolerant species increase their cytoplasmic levels of specific solutes, such as sugars, that are better tolerated at high concentrations, and which help reduce the loss of water from the cell during extracellular freezing.





 Plants deter herbivores with both physical and chemical defenses

Herbivory--animals eating plants--is a stress that plants face in any ecosystem. Plants counter excessive herbivory with both physical defenses, such as thorns, and chemical defenses, such as the production of distasteful or toxic compounds. For example, some plants produce an unusual amino acid called canavanine, named for one of its sources, the jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis). Canavanine resembles arginine, one of the 20 amino acids organisms incorporate into their proteins. If an insect eats a plant containing canavanine, the molecule is incorporated into the insect's proteins in place of arginine. Because canavanine is different enough from arginine to adversely affect the conformation and hence the function of the proteins, the insect dies.

At least some plants even recruit predatory animals that help defend the plant against specific herbivores. For example, insects called parasitoid wasps inject their eggs into their prey, including caterpillars feeding on plants. The eggs hatch within the caterpillars, and the larvae eat through their organic containers from the inside out. The plant, which benefits from the destruction of the herbivorous caterpillars, has an active role in this ecological drama. A leaf damaged by caterpillars releases volatile compounds that attract parasitoid wasps. The stimulus for this response is a combination of the physical damage to the leaf caused by the munching caterpillar and a specific compound present in the caterpillar's saliva (FIGURE 39.29).

Fig 39-29. A corn leaf recruits a parasitoid wasp as a defensive response to an herbivore, an army-worm caterpillar.

The volatile molecules a plant releases in response to herbivore damage can also function as an "early warning system" for nearby plants of the same species. Lima bean plants infested with spider mites release volatile chemicals that signal "news" of the attack to neighboring, noninfested lima bean plants. In response to these volatiles, noninfested lima bean leaves activate defense genes. Volatiles released from artificially wounded leaves do not have the same effect. The expression pattern of the genes activated by the infestation-released volatiles is similar to that produced by exposure to jasmonic acid, an important molecule in plant defense. As a result of this gene activation, noninfested neighbors become less susceptible to spider mites and more attractive to another species of mite that preys upon spider mites.





 Plants use multiple lines of defense against pathogens

A plant's first line of defense against infection is the physical barrier of the plant's "skin," the epidermis of the primary plant body and the periderm of the secondary plant body (see Chapter 35). This first defense system, however, is not impenetrable. Viruses, bacteria, and the spores and hyphae of fungi can enter the plant through injuries or through natural openings in the epidermis, such as stomata. Once a pathogen invades, the plant mounts a chemical attack as a second line of defense that kills the pathogens and prevents their spread from the site of infection. This second defense system is enhanced by the plant's inherited ability to recognize certain pathogens.

Gene-for-Gene Recognition

Plants are generally resistant to most pathogens. This is because plants have an innate ability to recognize invading pathogens and to mount successful defenses. In a converse manner, successful pathogens cause disease because they are able to evade recognition or suppress host defense mechanisms. Pathogens against which a plant has little specific defense are said to be virulent. They are the exceptions, for if they were not, then hosts and pathogens would soon perish together. A kind of "compromise" has coevolved between plants and most of their pathogens. In such cases, the pathogen gains enough access to its host to perpetuate itself without severely damaging or killing the plant. Such strains of pathogens are termed avirulent.

Specific resistance to a plant disease is based on what is called gene-for-gene recognition, because it depends on a precise match-up between a genetic allele in the plant and an allele in the pathogen. This occurs when a plant with specific dominant resistance alleles (R) recognizes those pathogens that possess complementary avirulence (Avr) alleles (FIGURE 39.30). Specific recognition induces expression of certain plant genes, the products of which mount a defense against the pathogen. If the plant host does not contain the appropriate R gene, the pathogen can invade and kill the plant. There are many pathogens, and plants have many R genes--Arabidopsis has at least several hundred.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 39-30. Gene-for-gene resistance of plants to pathogens. (a) Resistance occurs when the plant has a particular dominant R allele that corresponds to a specific dominant Avr allele in the pathogen. R genes probably code for specific receptors. Avr genes produce compounds that function in the pathogen but also act as ligands that bind specifically to the host-plant cell's receptors. Disease occurs if there is no gene-for-gene recognition because (b) the pathogen has no dominant Avr allele matching an R allele in the plant, (c) the plant has no dominant R allele matching an Avr allele in the pathogen, or (d) both pathogen and plant lack alleles upon which recognition could be based.

It is not the R and Avr genes themselves that interact, of course, but their products. The product of an R gene is probably a specific receptor protein inside a plant cell or at its surface. The Avr gene probably leads to production of some "signal" molecule from the pathogen, a ligand capable of binding specifically to the plant cell's receptor. The Avr product undoubtedly has some function upon which the pathogen itself depends, but the plant is able to "key" on this molecule as an announcement of the pathogen's presence. Binding of the ligand to the receptor triggers a signal-transduction pathway leading to a defense response in the infected plant tissue. This defense includes both an enhancement of the localized response at the site of infection and a more general systemic response of the whole plant.

Hypersensitive Response

Even if a plant is infected by a virulent strain of a pathogen--one for which that particular plant has no genetic resistance--the plant is able to mount a localized chemical attack in response to molecular signals released from cells damaged by the infection. Molecules called elicitors, often cellulose fragments called oligosaccharins released by cell-wall damage, induce the production of antimicrobial compounds called phytoalexins. Infection also activates genes that produce PR proteins (for pathogenesis-related). Some of these proteins are antimicrobial, attacking molecules in the cell wall of a bacterium, for example. Others may function as signals that spread "news" of the infection to nearby cells. Infection also stimulates cross-linking of molecules in the cell wall and deposition of lignin, responses that set up a local barricade that slows spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant.

If the pathogen is avirulent based on an R-Avr match, the localized defense response is more vigorous and is called a hypersensitive response (abbreviated HR). There is an enhanced production of phytoalexins and PR proteins, and the "sealing" response that contains the infection is more effective. After cells at the site of infection mount their chemical defense and seal off the area, they destroy themselves. We can see the result of an HR as lesions on a leaf or other infected organ. As "sick" as such a leaf appears, it will survive, and its defense response will help protect the rest of the plant (FIGURE 39.31).

Fig 39-31. Defense responses against an avirulent pathogen.

Systemic Acquired Resistance

The hypersensitive response, as you have learned, is localized and specific, a containment response based on gene-for-gene (R-Avr) recognition between host and pathogen. However, this defense response also includes production of chemical signals that "sound the alarm" of infection to the whole plant. Released from the site of infection, the alarm hormones are transported throughout the plant, stimulating production of phytoalexins and PR proteins. This response, called systemic acquired resistance (SAR), is nonspecific, providing protection against a diversity of pathogens for days (FIGURE 39.31).

A good candidate for one of the hormones responsible for activating SAR is salicylic acid. A modified form of this compound, acetylsalicylic acid, is the active ingredient in aspirin. Centuries before aspirin was sold as a pain reliever, some cultures had learned that chewing the bark of a willow tree (Salix) would lessen the pain of a toothache or headache. With the discovery of systemic acquired resistance, biologists have finally learned one function of salicylic acid in plants. Aspirin turns out to be a natural medicine in the plants that produce it, but with effects entirely different from the medicinal action in humans who consume the drug.

Plant biologists investigating disease resistance and other evolutionary adaptations of plants are getting to the heart of how a plant responds to internal and external signals. These scientists, along with thousands of other plant biologists working on other questions and millions of students experimenting with plants in biology courses, are all extending a centuries-old tradition of curiosity about the green organisms that feed the biosphere.
