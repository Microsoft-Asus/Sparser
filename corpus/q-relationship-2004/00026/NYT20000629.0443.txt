ATLANTA --
NASA declared this week that the cornerstone of the International Space Station , the long-delayed Russian -built service module , is finally ready to go -- a critical step in what space agency Administrator Daniel Goldin says will be a `` landmark '' year in a project that is 10 years late and tens of billions of dollars over budget .
The future of the $ 60 billion station depends heavily on a successful launch of the 21-ton module from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
The module contains the living quarters for the station 's first crews and the flight control systems to keep it in orbit .
If all goes as planned , a successful launch may mute -- at least temporarily -- the chorus of critics who say NASA has mismanaged the project from the beginning .
But so far very little in the history of the space station has gone according to plan .
Depending on whom one talks to , it is either the most complex and costly construction project ever attempted , or NASA 's biggest boondoggle .
The history of the 43-foot-long cylinder now being readied for launch July 12 , suggests it is a bit of both .
A ` STAR ' OR A ` BLUFF ' ?
The Russians call it `` Zvezda , '' or Star .
To NASA it is simply `` the service module '' -- the third and crucial component of the costliest and most ambitious space construction project in history .
To critics it is a pawn in a `` cosmic bluff '' that has strained U.S. Russian relations , drained billions of dollars from other space programs , and tarnished NASA 's can-do image with both Congress and the American public .
By any name , it is desperately needed for the continued assembly of the nascent space station , whose first components -- parked at an altitude of 250 miles -- now circle the globe every 90 minutes .
If all goes according to plan , the service module , which is about the size of a large tour bus , will reach the space station by late July .
In the next few months , four supply flights -- two by the Russians and two by the U.S. space shuttle -- will make the station ready to receive its first three-man crew in late October , at which point , Goldin said , `` the United States and our partners start to reap the benefits of long duration research in space . ''
Zvezda 's belated delivery , two years after it was supposed to be in orbit , also reflects the latest in a generation of unfulfilled promises and managerial missteps by the world 's leading spacefaring nations .
The service module has been built in fits and starts by disgruntled Russian laborers who sometimes worked without paychecks .
When money ran low , the Russian government insisted it had no funds to complete construction .
But while NASA fumed , the Russian space agency used its rubles -- and hardware earmarked for the International Space Station -- to keep its aging Mir space station alive in orbit .
Zvezda , which will supply the power needed to maintain the station 's orbit , was supposed to have been launched in early 1999 .
The snowballing delays and concerns that it might never be finished forced NASA to ante up more than $ 100 million to design and begin building a substitute .
In May , NASA had to press the space shuttle into service to boost the station to a higher altitude because -- absent Zvezda 's power supply -- it was in danger of falling out of orbit .
Shuttle astronauts also had to replace failed batteries aboard the 2-year -old Russian portion of the station .
COST WORRIES GROW As NASA has struggled to patch up -- and sometimes gloss over -- Russian missteps in the project , congressional critics of the station have spared no scorn .
`` NASA 's management of this program has all the appearances of a Keystone Cops movie , '' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher -LRB- R - Calif. -RRB- , chairman of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics .
`` The American people deserve better .
Our future in space demands it . ''
Upon completion , the station will be the largest structure ever assembled in space .
More than 350 feet in length and weighing more than a million pounds , it will be four times larger than Russia 's Mir space station and , like Mir , visible to the naked eye from Earth .
Assembling it will require more than 80 Russian and American launches and 1,900 hours of spacewalks over the next seven years .
If the past two years are a prologue , however , the space station will face additional delays , further cost increases and growing doubts about the U.S. space agency 's role in the project during and after construction .
$ 100 BILLION FINAL TAB ?
When President Ronald Reagan committed the nation to building a permanent station in space in 1984 , it was going to be finished by the early 1990s at a cost of about $ 8 billion .
NASA 's current plans call for completion of the station in 2007 .
And the price tag has grown to $ 60 billion .
But the General Accounting Office , which crunches numbers for Congress , says the delays , cost overruns , technical problems and poor planning have made it almost impossible to predict the final cost of the program .
Counting operating costs for the first 10 years of operation , the GAO 's best guess is that it will exceed $ 100 billion .
Space ventures have never fit neatly into Congress ' budgetary boxes .
The Apollo moon program and the space shuttle were both billions of dollars over budget .
But compared to those ventures , the space station is in a class by itself .
NASA has already spent at least $ 20 billion on designs , redesigns and the actual hardware that will be fitted together , like giant Tinker Toys .
The project now consumes $ 2.3 billion of NASA 's $ 14 billion annual budget .
Only one expense -- space shuttle operations -- is greater .
But for the next seven years , the shuttle fleet will be used primarily to ferry parts and supplies to the space station .
For the last few years , Congress has limited what NASA can spend on the space station to around $ 2 billion a year .
But because the spending cap had forced NASA to push needed work on the project farther into the future , the overall cost is still growing .
The critical role played by Russia , which in Reagan 's day was `` the evil empire '' but today is the United States ' principal partner in the space station project , has added a costly and frustrating new layer of complexity .
FINGERS POINT AT RUSSIA Congress initially agreed to fund the space station in 1993 because of the Clinton administration 's assurances that the participation of Russia and 14 other nations would reduce the cost to U.S. taxpayers , speed construction and help promote international cooperation .
`` This strategy has failed on each single point , '' said James Oberg , a independent space policy analyst and expert on the Russian space program .
`` Having the Russians involved has made the project cost more and take longer . ''
NASA itself estimates that Russian -induced delays in building the station will add about $ 3 billion to its final cost -- more than Russian participation was expected to save U.S. taxpayers when the project was proposed in 1993 .
`` The Russians have held America 's space station hostage to their delays , '' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner -LRB- R - Wis. -RRB- , who has criticized the space station as a `` black hole '' that continues to swallow U.S. tax dollars .
In recent months , members of Congress have introduced various bills that would link future funding for the station to Russia 's halting the sale of missile technology to Iran , terminate all Russian involvement in the project or kill the station outright .
None of the proposals is given a chance of passing .
On June 22 , legislation introduced by Rep. Tim Roemer -LRB- D - Ind. -RRB- , who files the same bill every year , called for cancellation of funding for the station .
This year , as before , it was defeated in the House , 325 to 98 .
With $ 20 billion already spent -- and NASA contracts for some piece of it strategically placed in every state , the space station has a powerful constituency .
But Oberg says NASA , in its haste to prove to Congress that it could get some piece of the station in orbit in the later 1990s , set a series of unrealistic target dates for the cash-strapped Russians .
The Russians promised to meet them , but never did .
Oberg said the result was that NASA and its Russian counterpart have been racing to meet arbitrary deadlines .
`` Each knew it was a cosmic bluff , and each was waiting for the other to flinch and ask for a slip , '' he said .
Whenever the timing grew crucial , the Russians tried to wring more money out of NASA .
Congress approved $ 60 million to tide the Russian Space Agency over in 1998 .
This year , even NASA chief Goldin , who has staunchly defended the Russian role in the project from the beginning , lost his patience .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">He is particularly irked that the Russians borrowed from the funds approved by Congress in 1998 to keep the aging Mir station in orbit -- and then tried to sell NASA a Soyuz launch vehicle for $ 65 million , about three times what it charged a private company for the same equipment .
Goldin has repeatedly asked the Russians to abandon Mir and focus on the International Space Station .
In June , Energia , the Russian company that operates the station , announced plans to keep it aloft indefinitely for use as a space tourism destination .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In cooperation with a Dutch company , the Russians -- proving to be quick learners when it comes to capitalism -- will offer trips to the station to anyone willing to pay $ 20 million for the privilege .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">So far , they have one customer , 59-year -old U.S. investment manager Dennis Tito .</ENAMEX>
`` We are at our wits ' end , '' Goldin told Congress in March .
`` We need that service module up there .
To say we are frustrated and disappointed is an understatement . ''
Goldin has warned the Russians that if Zvezda does n't fly soon , NASA will build a substitute interim control module itself .
Such a module , however , will still require Russian couplings to dock with the space station .
The Russians have offered to sell NASA a set of the hardware for $ 65 million .
Russian Space Agency Director Yuri Koptev says the U.S. space agency has had its own technical difficulties and delays in manufacturing parts for the space station .
NASA 's mismanagement , frequent redesigns and cost overruns also are drawing fire from congressional critics .
`` To date , U.S. dependence on Russian performance in the International Space Station program has cost taxpayers an estimated $ 5 billion and delayed the program by three years , '' said Sen. John McCain -LRB- R - Ariz. -RRB- , chairman of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee .
`` NASA needs to spend more time on technical management of its programs instead of counting their appropriation funds . ''
SAFETY ALSO A CONCERN But even as Zvezda undergoes its final checkout at Baikonur , it is clear that the space station 's problems are not over .
The Proton rocket that will carry Zvezda has been successfully flown in its current configuration only once .
Because two predecessors exploded in flight last year , NASA insisted -- and will get -- additional testing before committing the key piece of station hardware to the newly overhauled Proton launcher .
NASA 's engineers say Zvezda does not yet meet all of the agency 's safety requirements , including one for better protection from orbital debris that could endanger the crew or even `` cause the loss of the space station . ''
The shielding ca n't be installed on the ground because it would make the module too heavy to launch .
NASA plans to upgrade the shielding in 2004 , after the module has been in use for more than three years .
Allen Li , associate director of the agency 's security division says as Zvezda is currently built , a sudden loss of cabin pressure could disrupt the station 's guidance system and doom the station .
NASA plans to fix the problem in 2001 .
As costs and delays add up , scientists are worried that the station 's problems are undermining its original purpose : to serve as an orbiting laboratory for biotechnology , materials research , Earth observations and space science .
To the dismay of scientists , NASA has been borrowing from its own science programs , including some critical efforts to study the hazard of long-duration space flights .
`` The cancellation of scheduled research flights in order to fund construction is a clear deterrent to developing space -based projects , '' said David Kaufman , president of the 60,000-member Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology .
Kaufman says NASA 's diversion of life science research funds for construction could actually wind up jeopardizing the health of the very people who will man the station once it is finally completed .
