As astronomers study newly discovered planets orbiting distant stars, they hope to find evidence of water on these far-off worlds, for water is the substance that makes possible life as we know it here on Earth. All organisms familiar to us are made mostly of water and live in an environment dominated by water. Water is the biological medium here on Earth, and possibly on other planets as well.

Life on Earth began in water and evolved there for 3 billion years before spreading onto land. Modern life, even terrestrial (land-dwelling) life, remains tied to water. Most cells are surrounded by water, and cells themselves are about 70-95% water. Three-quarters of Earth's surface is submerged in water. Although most of this water is in liquid form, water is also present on Earth as ice and vapor. Water is the only common substance to exist in the natural environment in all three physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. These three states of water are visible in the photograph on this page, a view of Earth from space.

The abundance of water is a major reason Earth is habitable. In a classic book called The Fitness of the Environment, Lawrence Henderson highlights the importance of water to life. While acknowledging that life adapts to its environment through natural selection, Henderson emphasizes that for life to exist at all, the environment must first be a suitable abode. Your objective in this chapter is to develop a conceptual understanding of how water contributes to the fitness of Earth for life.

Water is so common that it is easy to overlook the fact that it is an exceptional substance with many extraordinary qualities. Following the theme of emergent properties, we can trace water's unique behavior to the structure and interactions of its molecules.





THE DISSOCIATION OF WATER MOLECULES

 Acid precipitation threatens the fitness of the environment



Occasionally, a hydrogen atom shared by two water molecules in a hydrogen bond shifts from one molecule to the other. When this happens, the hydrogen atom leaves its electron behind, and what is actually transferred is a hydrogen ion, a single proton with a charge of +1. The water molecule that lost a proton is now a hydroxide ion (OH-), which has a charge of -1. The proton binds to the other water molecule, making that molecule a hydronium ion (H3O+). We can picture the chemical reaction this way:

Although this is what actually happens, we can think of the process in a simplified way, as the dissociation (separation) of a water molecule into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxide ion: 

As the double arrows indicate, this is a reversible reaction that will reach a state of dynamic equilibrium when water dissociates at the same rate that it is being re-formed from H+ and OH-. At this equilibrium point, the concentration of water molecules greatly exceeds the concentrations of H+ and OH-. In fact, in pure water, only one water molecule in every 554 million is dissociated. The concentration of each ion in pure water is 10-7M (at 25&#176;C). This means that there is only one ten-millionth of a mole of hydrogen ions per liter of pure water and an equal number of hydroxide ions.

Although the dissociation of water is reversible and statistically rare, it is exceedingly important in the chemistry of life. Hydrogen and hydroxide ions are very reactive. Changes in their concentrations can drastically affect a cell's proteins and other complex molecules. As we have seen, the concentrations of H+ and OH- are equal in pure water, but adding certain kinds of solutes, called acids and bases, disrupts this balance. Biologists use something called the pH scale to describe how acidic or basic (the opposite of acidic) a solution is. In the remainder of this chapter, you will learn about acids, bases, and pH and why changes in pH can adversely affect organisms.





 The polarity of water molecules results in hydrogen bonding

Studied in isolation, the water molecule is deceptively simple. Its two hydrogen atoms are joined to the oxygen atom by single covalent bonds. Because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, the electrons of the polar bonds spend more time closer to the oxygen atom. In other words, the bonds that hold together the atoms in a water molecule are polar covalent bonds, with the oxygen region of the molecule having a partial negative charge and the hydrogens having a partial positive charge. The water molecule, shaped something like a wide V, is a polar molecule, meaning that opposite ends of the molecule have opposite charges (see figure 2.13).

The anomalous properties of water arise from attractions between these polar molecules. The attraction is electrical; a slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule. The two molecules are thus held together by a hydrogen bond (FIGURE 3.1). Each water molecule can form hydrogen bonds to a maximum of four neighbors, and at any given moment, many of the molecules in a sample of liquid water are linked in this way. The extraordinary qualities of water are emergent properties resulting from the hydrogen bonding that orders molecules into a higher level of structural organization.

Fig 3-1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The charged regions of a polar water molecule are attracted to oppositely charged parts of neighboring molecules. (The oxygen has a slight negative charge; the hydrogens have a slight positive charge.) Each molecule can hydrogen-bond to a maximum of four partners. At any instant in liquid water at 37&#176;C (human body temperature), about 15% of the molecules are bonded to four partners in short-lived clusters.

We will examine four of water's properties that contribute to the fitness of Earth as an environment for life: water's cohesive behavior, its ability to stabilize temperature, its expansion upon freezing, and its versatility as a solvent.





 Organisms depend on the cohesion of water molecules

Water molecules stick to each other as a result of hydrogen bonding. When water is in its liquid form, its hydrogen bonds are very fragile, about one-twentieth as strong as covalent bonds. They form, break, and re-form with great frequency. Each hydrogen bond lasts only a few trillionths of a second, but the molecules are constantly forming new bonds with a succession of partners. Thus, at any instant, a substantial percentage of all the water molecules are bonded to their neighbors, making water more structured than most other liquids. Collectively, the hydrogen bonds hold the substance together, a phenomenon called cohesion.

Cohesion due to hydrogen bonding contributes to the transport of water against gravity in plants. Water reaches the leaves through microscopic vessels that extend upward from the roots (FIGURE 3.2). Water that evaporates from a leaf is replaced by water from the vessels in the veins of the leaf. Hydrogen bonds cause water molecules leaving the veins to tug on molecules farther down in the vessel, and the upward pull is transmitted along the vessel all the way down to the roots. Adhesion, the clinging of one substance to another, also plays a role. Adhesion of water to the walls of the vessels helps counter the downward pull of gravity.

Fig 3-2. Water transport in plants. Evaporation from leaves pulls water upward from the roots through microscopic tubes called xylem vessels, in this case located in the trunk of a tree. Cohesion due to hydrogen bonding helps hold together the column of water within a vessel. Adhesion of the water to the vessel wall also helps in resisting the downward pull of gravity.

Related to cohesion is surface tension, a measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid. Water has a greater surface tension than most other liquids. At the interface between water and air is an ordered arrangement of water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to one another and to the water below. This makes the water behave as though coated with an invisible film. We can observe the surface tension of water by slightly overfilling a drinking glass; the water will stand above the rim. Water's surface tension also allows us to skip rocks on a pond. In a more biological example, some animals can stand, walk, or run on water without breaking the surface (FIGURE 3.3).

Fig 3-3. Walking on water. The high surface tension of water, resulting from the collective strength of its hydrogen bonds, allows the water strider to walk on a pond without breaking the surface.





 Water moderates temperatures on Earth

Water stabilizes air temperatures by absorbing heat from air that is warmer and releasing the stored heat to air that is cooler. Water is effective as a heat bank because it can absorb or release a relatively large amount of heat with only a slight change in its own temperature. To understand this quality of water, we must first look briefly at heat and temperature.

Heat and Temperature

Anything that moves has kinetic energy, the energy of motion. Atoms and molecules have kinetic energy because they are always moving, although not necessarily in any particular direction. The faster a molecule moves, the greater its kinetic energy. Heat is a measure of the total quantity of kinetic energy due to molecular motion in a body of matter. Temperature measures the intensity of heat due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. When the average speed of the molecules increases, a thermometer records this as a rise in temperature. Heat and temperature are related, but they are not the same. A swimmer crossing the English Channel has a higher temperature than the water, but the ocean contains far more heat because of its volume.

Whenever two objects of different temperature are brought together, heat passes from the warmer to the cooler body until the two are the same temperature. Molecules in the cooler object speed up at the expense of the kinetic energy of the warmer object. An ice cube cools a drink not by adding coldness to the liquid, but by absorbing heat as the ice melts.

Throughout this book, we will use the Celsius scale to indicate temperature (Celsius degrees are abbreviated as &#176;C). At sea level, water freezes at 0&#176;C and boils at 100&#176;C. The temperature of the human body averages 37&#176;C, and comfortable room temperature is about 20-25&#176;C.

One convenient unit of heat used in this book is the calorie (cal). A calorie is the amount of heat energy it takes to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1&#176;C. Conversely, a calorie is also the amount of heat that 1 g of water releases when it cools by 1&#176;C. A kilocalorie (kcal), 1,000 cal, is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram (kg) of water by 1&#176;C. (The "calories" on food packages are actually kilocalories.) Another energy unit used in this book is the joule (J). One joule equals 0.239 cal; a calorie equals 4.184 J.

Water's High Specific Heat

The ability of water to stabilize temperature stems from its relatively high specific heat. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1&#176;C. We already know water's specific heat because we have defined a calorie as the amount of heat that causes 1 g of water to change its temperature by 1&#176;C. Therefore, the specific heat of water is 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius, abbreviated as 1 cal/g/&#176;C. Compared with most other substances, water has an unusually high specific heat. For example, ethyl alcohol, the type of alcohol in alcoholic beverages, has a specific heat of 0.6 cal/g/&#176;C.

Because of the high specific heat of water relative to other materials, water will change its temperature less when it absorbs or loses a given amount of heat. The reason you can burn your fingers by touching the metal handle of a pot on the stove when the water in the pot is still lukewarm is that the specific heat of water is ten times greater than that of iron. In other words, it will take only 0.1 cal to raise the temperature of 1 g of iron 1&#176;C. Specific heat can be thought of as a measure of how well a substance resists changing its temperature when it absorbs or releases heat. Water resists changing its temperature; when it does change its temperature, it absorbs or loses a relatively large quantity of heat for each degree of change.

We can trace water's high specific heat, like many of its other properties, to hydrogen bonding. Heat must be absorbed in order to break hydrogen bonds, and heat is released when hydrogen bonds form. A calorie of heat causes a relatively small change in the temperature of water because much of the heat energy is used to disrupt hydrogen bonds before the water molecules can begin moving faster. And when the temperature of water drops slightly, many additional hydrogen bonds form, releasing a considerable amount of energy in the form of heat.

What is the relevance of water's high specific heat to life on Earth? A large body of water can absorb and store a huge amount of heat from the sun in the daytime and during summer, while warming up only a few degrees. At night and during winter, the gradually cooling water can warm the air. This is the reason coastal areas generally have milder climates than inland regions. The high specific heat of water also tends to stabilize ocean temperatures, creating a favorable environment for marine life. Thus, because of its high specific heat, the water that covers most of Earth keeps temperature fluctuations on land and in water within limits that permit life. Also, because organisms are made primarily of water, they are more able to resist changes in their own temperatures than if they were made of a liquid with a lower specific heat.

Evaporative Cooling

Molecules of any liquid stay close together because they are attracted to one another. Molecules moving fast enough to overcome these attractions can depart the liquid and enter the air as gas. This transformation from a liquid to a gas is called vaporization, or evaporation. Recall that the speed of molecular movement varies and that temperature is the average kinetic energy of molecules. Even at low temperatures, the speediest molecules can escape into the air. Some evaporation occurs at any temperature; a glass of water, for example, will eventually evaporate at room temperature. If a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of molecules increases and the liquid evaporates more rapidly.

Heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted from the liquid to the gaseous state. Compared with most other liquids, water has a high heat of vaporization. To evaporate each gram of water at room temperature, about 580 cal of heat is needed-nearly double the amount needed to vaporize a gram of alcohol or ammonia. Water's high heat of vaporization is another emergent property caused by hydrogen bonds, which must be broken before the molecules can make their exodus from the liquid.

Water's high heat of vaporization helps moderate Earth's climate. A considerable amount of solar heat absorbed by tropical seas is consumed during the evaporation of surface water. Then, as moist tropical air circulates poleward, it releases heat as it condenses to form rain.

As a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down. This evaporative cooling occurs because the "hottest" molecules, those with the greatest kinetic energy, are the most likely to leave as gas. It is as if the 100 fastest runners at a college transferred to another school; the average speed of the remaining students would decline.

Evaporative cooling of water contributes to the stability of temperature in lakes and ponds and also provides a mechanism that prevents terrestrial organisms from overheating. For example, evaporation of water from the leaves of a plant helps keep the tissues in the leaves from becoming too warm in the sunlight. Evaporation of sweat from human skin dissipates body heat and helps prevent overheating on a hot day or when excess heat is generated by strenuous activity (FIGURE 3.4). High humidity on a hot day increases discomfort because the high concentration of water vapor in the air inhibits the evaporation of sweat from the body.

 Oceans and lakes don't freeze solid because ice floats

Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than as a liquid. In other words, ice floats. While other materials contract when they solidify, water expands. The cause of this exotic behavior is, once again, hydrogen bonding. At temperatures above 4&#176;C, water behaves like other liquids, expanding as it warms and contracting as it cools. Water begins to freeze when its molecules are no longer moving vigorously enough to break their hydrogen bonds. As the temperature reaches 0&#176;C, the water becomes locked into a crystalline lattice, each water molecule bonded to the maximum of four partners (FIGURE 3.5). The hydrogen bonds keep the molecules at "arm's length," far enough apart to make ice about 10% less dense (10% fewer molecules for the same volume) than liquid water at 4&#176;C. When ice absorbs enough heat for its temperature to rise above 0&#176;C, hydrogen bonds between molecules are disrupted. As the crystal collapses, the ice melts, and molecules are free to slip closer together. Water reaches its greatest density at 4&#176;C and then begins to expand as the molecules move faster. Keep in mind, however, that even in liquid water, many of the molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds, though only transiently: The hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking and reforming.

Fig 3-5. The structure of ice. In ice, each molecule is hydrogen-bonded to four neighbors in a three-dimensional crystal. Because the crystal is spacious, ice has fewer molecules than an equal volume of liquid water. In other words, ice is less dense than liquid water.

The ability of ice to float because of the expansion of water as it solidifies is an important factor in the fitness of the environment. If ice sank, then eventually all ponds, lakes, and even oceans would freeze solid, making life as we know it impossible on Earth. During summer, only the upper few inches of the ocean would thaw. Instead, when a deep body of water cools, the floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist under the frozen surface (FIGURE 3.6).

 Water is the solvent of life

A sugar cube placed in a glass of water will dissolve. The glass will then contain a uniform mixture of sugar and water; the concentration of dissolved sugar will be the same everywhere in the mixture. A liquid that is a completely homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is called a solution. The dissolving agent of a solution is the solvent, and the substance that is dissolved is the solute. In this case, water is the solvent and sugar is the solute. An aqueous solution is one in which water is the solvent.

The medieval alchemists tried to find a universal solvent, one that would dissolve anything. They learned that nothing works better than water. However, water is not a universal solvent; if it were, it could not be stored in any container, including our cells. But water is a very versatile solvent, a quality we can trace to the polarity of the water molecule.

Suppose, for example, that a crystal of the ionic compound sodium chloride is placed in water (FIGURE 3.7). At the surface of the crystal, the sodium and chloride ions are exposed to the solvent. These ions and the water molecules have a mutual affinity through electrical attraction. The oxygen regions of the water molecules are negatively charged and cling to sodium cations. The hydrogen regions of the water molecules are positively charged and are attracted to chloride anions. As a result, water molecules surround the individual sodium and chloride ions, separating and shielding them from one another. The sphere of water molecules around each dissolved ion is called a hydration shell. Working inward from the surface of the salt crystal, water eventually dissolves all the ions. The result is a solution of two solutes, sodium and chloride, homogeneously mixed with water, the solvent. Other ionic compounds also dissolve in water. Seawater, for instance, contains a great variety of dissolved ions, as do living cells.

Fig 3-7. A crystal of table salt dissolving in water. A sphere of water molecules, called a hydration shell, surrounds each solute ion.

A compound does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water; compounds made up of polar molecules, such as sugars, are also water-soluble. Such compounds dissolve when water molecules surround each of the solute molecules. Even molecules as large as proteins can dissolve in water if they have ionic and polar regions on their surface (FIGURE 3.8). Many different kinds of polar compounds are dissolved (along with ions) in the water of such biological fluids as blood, the sap of plants, and the liquid within all cells. Water is the solvent of life.

Fig 3-8. A water-soluble protein. Even a molecule as large as a protein can dissolve in water if it has enough ionic and polar regions on its surface. The mass of purple here represents a single such protein molecule, which is being surrounded by water molecules.

Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances

Whether ionic or polar, any substance that has an affinity for water is said to be hydrophilic (from the Greek hydro, water, and philios, loving). This term is used even if the substance does not dissolve-because the molecules are too large, for instance. Cotton, a plant product, is an example of a hydrophilic substance that absorbs water without dissolving. Cotton consists of giant molecules of cellulose, a compound with numerous regions of partial positive and partial negative charges associated with polar bonds. Water adheres to the cellulose fibers. Thus, a cotton towel does a great job of drying the body, yet does not dissolve in the washing machine. Cellulose is also present in the walls of water-conducting vessels in a plant; you read earlier how the adhesion of water to these hydrophilic walls functions in water transport.

There are, of course, substances that do not have an affinity for water. Substances that are non-ionic and nonpolar actually seem to repel water; these substances are termed hydrophobic (from the Greek phobos, fearing). An example from the kitchen is vegetable oil, which, as you know, does not mix stably with watery substances such as vinegar. The hydrophobic behavior of the oil molecules results from a prevalence of nonpolar bonds, in this case bonds between carbon and hydrogen, which share electrons almost equally. Hydrophobic molecules related to oils are major ingredients of cell membranes. (Imagine what would happen to a cell if its membrane dissolved.)

Solute Concentration in Aqueous Solutions

Biological chemistry is "wet" chemistry. Most of the chemical reactions that occur in organisms involve solutes dissolved in water. To carry out experiments on the chemistry of life, it is important to learn how to calculate the concentrations of solutes dissolved in aqueous solutions.

To understand chemical reactions, we need to know how many atoms and molecules are involved. Suppose we wanted to prepare an aqueous solution of table sugar having a specified concentration of sugar molecules (a certain number of solute molecules in a certain volume of solution). Because counting or weighing individual molecules is not practical, we usually measure substances in units called moles. A mole (mol) is equal in number to the molecular weight of a substance, but upscaled from daltons to units of grams. Imagine weighing out 1 mol of table sugar (sucrose), which has the molecular formula C12H22O11. In round numbers, a carbon atom weighs 12 daltons, a hydrogen atom weighs 1 dalton, and an oxygen atom weighs 16 daltons. Molecular weight is the sum of the weights of all the atoms in a molecule; thus, the molecular weight of sucrose is 342 daltons. To obtain 1 mol of sucrose, we weigh out 342 g, the molecular weight of sucrose expressed in grams.

The practical advantage of measuring a quantity of chemicals in moles is that a mole of one substance has exactly the same number of molecules as a mole of any other substance. If substance A has a molecular weight of 10 daltons and substance B has a molecular weight of 100 daltons, then 10 g of A will have the same number of molecules as 100 g of B. The number of molecules in a mole, called Avogadro's number, is 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023. A mole of table sugar contains 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023 sucrose molecules and weighs 342 g. A mole of ethyl alcohol (C2H6O) also contains 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023 molecules, but it weighs only 46 g because the molecules are smaller than those of sucrose. Measuring in moles makes it convenient for scientists working in the laboratory to combine substances in fixed ratios of molecules.

How would we make a liter (L) of solution consisting of 1 mol of sucrose dissolved in water? We would weigh out 342 g of sucrose and then gradually add water, while stirring, until the sugar was completely dissolved. We would then add enough water to bring the total volume of the solution up to 1 L. At that point, we would have a 1-molar (1 M) solution of sucrose. Molarity-the number of moles of solute per liter of solution-is the unit of concentration most often used by biologists for aqueous solutions.





 Organisms are sensitive to changes in pH

Before discussing the pH scale, let's see what acids and bases are and how they interact with water.

Acids and Bases

What would cause an aqueous solution to have an imbalance in its H+ and OH- concentrations? When the substances called acids dissolve in water, they donate additional H1 to the solution. An acid, according to the definition most often used by biologists, is a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to water, hydrogen ions dissociate from chloride ions: 

This additional source of H+ (dissociation of water is the other source) results in the solution having more H+ than OH-. Such a solution is known as an acidic solution.

A substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is called a base. Some bases reduce the H+ concentration directly by accepting hydrogen ions. Ammonia (NH3), for instance, acts as a base when the unshared electron pair in nitrogen's valence shell attracts a hydrogen ion from the solution, resulting in an ammonium ion (NH4+):

Other bases reduce the H+ concentration indirectly by dissociating to form hydroxide ions, which then combine with hydrogen ions in the solution to form water. One base that acts this way is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which in water dissociates into its ions:  In either case, the base reduces the H+ concentration. Solutions with a higher concentration of OH- than H+ are known as basic solutions. A solution in which the H+ and OH- concentrations are equal is said to be neutral.

Notice that single arrows were used in the reactions for HCl and NaOH. These compounds dissociate completely when mixed with water. Hydrochloric acid is called a strong acid and sodium hydroxide a strong base because they dissociate completely. In contrast, ammonia is a relatively weak base. The double arrows in the reaction for ammonia indicate that the binding and release of the hydrogen ion are reversible, although at equilibrium there will be a fixed ratio of NH4+ to NH3.

There are also weak acids, which reversibly release and reaccept hydrogen ions. An example is carbonic acid, which has essential functions in many organisms:  Here the equilibrium so favors the reaction in the left direction that when carbonic acid is added to water, only 1% of the molecules are dissociated at any particular time. Still, that is enough to shift the balance of H+ and OH- from neutrality.

The pH Scale

In any solution, the product of the H+ and OH- concentrations is constant at 10-14. This can be written  In such an equation, brackets indicate molar concentration for the substance enclosed within them. In a neutral solution at room temperature (25&#176;C), [H+] = 10-7 and [OH-] = 10-7, so in this case, 10-14 is the product of 10-7&#160;X&#160; 10-7. If enough acid is added to a solution to increase [H+] to 10-5M, then [OH-] will decline by an equivalent amount to 10-9M (note that 10-5&#160;X&#160; 10-9 = 10-14). This constant relationship expresses the behavior of acids and bases in a solution. An acid not only adds hydrogen ions to a solution, but also removes hydroxide ions because of the tendency for H+ to combine with OH- to form water. A base has the opposite effect, increasing OH- concentration but also reducing H+ concentration by the formation of water. If enough of a base is added to raise the OH- concentration to 10-4M, the H+ concentration will drop to 10-10M. Whenever we know the concentration of either H+ or OH- in a solution, we can deduce the concentration of the other ion.

Because the H+ and OH- concentrations of solutions can vary by a factor of 100 trillion or more, scientists have developed a way to express this variation more conveniently than in moles per liter. The pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14 (FIGURE 3.9), compresses the range of H+ and OH- concentrations by employing logarithms. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration:

Fig 3-9. The pH of some aqueous solutions.

For a neutral solution, [H+] is 10-7M, giving us 

Notice that pH declines as H+ concentration increases. Notice, too, that although the pH scale is based on H+ concentration, it also implies OH- concentration. A solution of pH 10 has a hydrogen ion concentration of 10-10M and a hydroxide ion concentration of 10-4M.

The pH of a neutral solution is 7, the midpoint of the scale. A pH value less than 7 denotes an acidic solution; the lower the number, the more acidic the solution. The pH for basic solutions is above 7. Most biological fluids are within the range pH 6 to pH 8. There are a few exceptions, however, including the strongly acidic digestive juice of the human stomach, which has a pH of about 2.

It is important to remember that each pH unit represents a tenfold difference in H+ and OH- concentrations. It is this mathematical feature that makes the pH scale so compact. A solution of pH 3 is not twice as acidic as a solution of pH 6, but a thousand times more acidic. When the pH of a solution changes slightly, the actual concentrations of H+ and OH- in the solution change substantially.

Buffers

The internal pH of most living cells is close to 7. Even a slight change in pH can be harmful, because the chemical processes of the cell are very sensitive to the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions.

Thanks to the presence of buffers, biological fluids resist changes to their own pH when acids or bases are introduced. Buffers are substances that minimize changes in the concentrations of H+ and OH- in a solution. For example, buffers normally maintain the pH of human blood very close to 7.4. A person cannot survive for more than a few minutes if the blood pH drops to 7 or rises to 7.8. Under normal circumstances, the buffering capacity of the blood prevents such swings in pH.

A buffer works by accepting hydrogen ions from the solution when they are in excess and donating hydrogen ions to the solution when they have been depleted. Most buffer solutions contain a weak acid and its corresponding base, which combine reversibly with hydrogen ions. One of the buffers that contribute to pH stability in human blood and many other biological solutions is carbonic acid (H2CO3), which, as already mentioned, dissociates to yield a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a hydrogen ion (H+): 

The chemical equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate acts as a pH regulator, the reaction shifting left or right as other processes in the solution add or remove hydrogen ions. If the H+ concentration in blood begins to fall (that is, if pH rises), more carbonic acid dissociates, replenishing hydrogen ions. But when H+ concentration in blood begins to rise (pH drops), the bicarbonate ion acts as a base and removes the excess hydrogen ions from the solution. Thus, the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffering system consists of an acid and a base in equilibrium with each other. Most other buffers are also acid-base pairs.





 Acid precipitation threatens the fitness of the environment

Considering the dependence of all life on water, contamination of rivers, lakes, and seas is a dire environmental problem. One of the most serious assaults on water quality is acid precipitation.

Uncontaminated rain has a pH of about 5.6, slightly acidic, owing to the formation of carbonic acid from carbon dioxide and water. Acid precipitation refers to rain, snow, or fog that is more acidic than pH 5.6. What causes acid precipitation, and what are its effects on the fitness of the environment?

Acid precipitation is caused primarily by the presence in the atmosphere of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, gaseous compounds that react with water in the air to form strong acids, which fall to earth with rain or snow. A major source of these oxides is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) in factories and automobiles. Electrical power plants that burn coal produce more of these pollutants than any other single source. Ironically, the tall smokestacks built to reduce local pollution by dispersing factory exhaust help spread airborne pollutants. Winds carry the pollutants away, and acid rain may fall thousands of miles away from industrial centers. In the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, the pH of rainfall averages 4.2, about 25 times more acidic than normal rain. Acid precipitation falls on many other regions, including the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest and certain parts of Europe and Asia. One West Virginia storm dropped rain having a pH of 1.5, as acidic as the digestive juices in our stomachs!

The effect of acids in lakes and streams is most pronounced in the spring, as snow begins to melt. The surface snow melts first, drains down, and sends much of the acid that has accumulated over the winter into lakes and streams all at once. Early meltwater often has a pH as low as 3, and this acid surge hits when fish and other forms of aquatic life are producing eggs and young, which are especially vulnerable to acidic conditions. Strong acidity can alter the structure of biological molecules and prevent them from carrying out the essential chemical processes of life.

Although acid precipitation can clearly damage life in lakes and streams, its direct effects on forests and other terrestrial life are controversial. However, recent research indicates that acid rain and snow can bring about profound changes in soils by affecting the solubility of soil minerals. Acid precipitation falling on land washes away certain mineral ions, such as calcium and magnesium ions, that ordinarily help buffer the soil solution and are essential nutrients for plant growth. At the same time, other minerals, such as aluminum, reach toxic concentrations when acidification increases their solubility. The effects of acid precipitation on soil chemistry have contributed to the decline of European forests and are taking a toll on some North American forests (FIGURE 3.10). Nevertheless, studies indicate that the majority of North American forests are not currently suffering substantially from acid precipitation.

If there is reason for optimism about the future quality of water resources, it is our progress in reducing certain kinds of pollution. For example, in the United States, Canada, and Europe, emissions of sulfur oxides have declined markedly in recent decades, causing a decrease in acid precipitation. Continued progress can come only from the actions of people who are concerned about environmental quality. An essential part of their education is to understand the crucial role that water plays in the environment's fitness for continued life on Earth.
