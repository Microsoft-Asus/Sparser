WASHINGTON --
Early last year , as undercover U.S. Customs agents neared the end of the biggest investigation ever conducted into the illegal movement of drug money , bankers working with Mexico 's most powerful cocaine cartel approached them with a stunning offer .
The agents , posing as money launderers from Colombia , had insinuated themselves deeply into the Mexican underworld , helping the traffickers hide more than $ 60 million .
Now , money men working with the cartel said they had clients who needed to launder $ 1.15 billion more .
The most important of those clients , they said , was Mexico 's powerful defense minister .
The customs agents did n't know whether the money really existed or if any of it belonged to the minister , Gen. Enrique Cervantes , officials said .
But rather than continue the undercover operation to pursue the deal , Clinton administration officials ordered it to end on schedule several weeks later .
No further effort was ever made to investigate the offer , and officials said prosecutors had not even raised the matter with the suspects in the case , who have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the authorities .
`` Why are we sitting on this kind of information ? '' asked the former senior customs agent who led the undercover inquiry , William F. Gately .
`` It 's either because we 're lazy , we 're stupid , or the political will does n't exist to engage in the kind of investigation where our law-enforcement efforts might damage our foreign policy . ''
Senior administration officials denied that foreign policy influenced their decision to end the operation , saying they were moved primarily by concerns for its security .
They also emphasized that the agents were unable to verify the Mexican traffickers ' claims .
Other officials of the administration , which has based much of its Mexican drug strategy on collaboration with Cervantes , said they were confident that he was above reproach .
A spokesman for the Mexican Defense Ministry , Lt. Col. Francisco Aguilar Hernandez , dismissed the traffickers ' proposal as self-serving lies .
But a detailed account of the case , based on confidential government documents , court records and dozens of interviews , suggests that U.S. officials walked away from an extraordinary opportunity to examine accusations of the official corruption that is considered the main obstacle to anti-drug efforts in Mexico .
`` Obviously it was a significant allegation , '' Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said .
`` There was skepticism about it .
Was it puffing ?
It just was not seen as being -- I wo n't use the word credible -- but it was n't verified . ''
