GENETIC VARIATION, THE SUBSTRATE FOR NATURAL SELECTION

 

 Genetic variation occurs within and between populations



 

 Mutation and sexual recombination generate genetic variation



 

 Diploidy and balanced polymorphism preserve variation



Heritable variation is at the heart of Darwin's theory of evolution, for variation provides the raw material--the substrate--on which natural selection works.
