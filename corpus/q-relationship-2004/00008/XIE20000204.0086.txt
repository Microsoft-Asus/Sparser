The Public Security Investigation Agency , aided by police , searched the cult 's facilities in Otawara , Tochigi Prefecture , where some of Aum founder Shoko Asahara 's children live , security sources said .
Other Aum facilities inspected included those in the town of Sanwa in Ibaraki Prefecture , Koshigaya in Saitama Prefecture , Minokamo in Gifu Prefecture , and the town of Kosei in Shiga Prefecture .
The agency conducted the searches for the first time since its inception in 1952 .
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said the government hopes the inspections will help dispel local residents ' concerns over the presence of Aum in their communities .
The agency and police gained permission from the Public Security Examination Commission to search the Aum facilities under a law enacted last December to crack down on the cult .
The commission allowed the agency to put Aum under surveillance in collaboration with the police for up to three years .
Aum has committed a series of crimes including the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system , which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000 .
