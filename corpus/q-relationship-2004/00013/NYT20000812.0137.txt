On May 18 , the Federal Aviation Administration issued what appeared to be an important safety notice for the world 's airlines .
Federal investigators had learned that a manufacturer of cables that work key controls in many widely used jetliners might not have properly tested its cables .
Samples checked by investigators , the notice said , had failed to meet minimum requirements for strength .
FAA officials expected the airlines to inspect the cables , and , if necessary , replace them .
But federal prosecutors who are suing the cable maker over its testing procedures said that the notification system broke down because the critical information did not reach airlines as intended .
So the prosecutors took the extraordinary step of asking a federal judge to break a court seal on their evidence , allowing them to send letters to 500 airlines and repair companies around the world warning them of the possible danger .
Daniel J. French , the U.S. attorney in Syracuse , N.Y. , said 46 of the letters went to airlines , including 36 domestic carriers , although he would not identify specific companies .
French , who is in charge of the case , would not discuss the motivation for sending the letters , but said he acted under federal law to ensure the public safety .
Critics said the case was typical of the FAA 's lack of urgency about cases involving potentially defective spare parts .
The agency , they say , has routinely failed to act aggressively when alerted to possible problems with parts , chiefly because no U.S. airline crash has ever been linked to them .
In court papers , prosecutors said airlines bought cable from parts wholesalers and not directly from cable makers ; in this case , an obscure company called Strandflex , based near Syracuse .
But the FAA notice mentioned only Strandflex , and not the wholesalers .
Margaret Gilligan , the FAA 's deputy associate administrator for regulation and certification , said the agency had handled the case as it does scores of others when it informed airlines about the cable .
The airlines , she said , should have pushed their suppliers to find out whether any of them had sold cable from Strandflex .
`` It 's the airlines ' responsibility to find out what parts they are putting on their aircraft , '' she said .
In addition , Gilligan said , the FAA does not believe the cable presents a threat to public safety .
No flight problems have ever been attributed to Strandflex cable , and pilots can compensate for a snapped cable by using other control systems on the airplane .
But the disagreement between prosecutors and federal aviation officials -- about the degree of the cable 's potential threat and the adequacy of the notification system -- highlights a longstanding debate over how the FAA deals with suspect airplane parts .
Jim Burnett , a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and a frequent critic of the FAA , said the agency often seemed more concerned with public perception than with rigorous enforcement .
If there is a problem with perception , Burnett said , the FAA will `` announce a program to do something about it . ''
The attitude seems to be , he said , `` Whether or not we do anything is not important as long as people think we are doing something . ''
FAA officials said the Strandflex notice in part reflected the needs of the agency to set priorities in its safety work .
Diane Spitaliere , a spokeswoman , said the agency handled hundreds of urgent warnings each year regarding problems that could pose immediate safety hazards .
The FAA is required to address those problems before dealing with less serious cases , she said .
And even its strongest critics acknowledge that the FAA regularly acts with speed and decisiveness when there is proof of imminent danger to the public .
Worries about mechanical flaws have in recent years forced a series of widespread groundings of planes .
Airlines buy millions of dollars of spare parts each year , and the question of how to police their quality has long vexed the agency .
In the early 1990s a series of federal investigations disclosed that companies were selling inferior parts , some of which were deemed critical to safe flying .
Mary Schiavo , the former inspector general for Department of Transportation who conducted the investigations , said there was no system in place at that time to warn airlines about the parts .
The agency eventually set up procedures to notify airlines of potential problems .
Besides posting notices , the FAA established a system to monitor parts , require reporting of suspect parts and study ways of marking parts to ensure they have been properly manufactured .
In recent years , the agency has posted warnings about parts from life rafts to propellers .
The FAA 's Web site also warns of repair companies accused of performing substandard work and of parts suppliers charged with selling bogus parts masquerading as certified equipment .
But despite the improvements , the new system has disappointed safety advocates as well as industry representatives , who say the FAA often moves too rashly in branding parts defective , unfairly harming their businesses .
Last year , as the Strandflex case moved forward , the head of the trade group representing aircraft repair companies raised questions with the FAA about the fairness of the notification system .
Sarah MacLeod , executive director of the trade group , the Aeronautical Repair Station Association , said she told FAA officials that their notices often failed to clearly say what mechanics should do about the suspect parts .
She said that she was unaware of the situation involving Strandflex at the time she talked to the FAA , but that she did tell agency officials that manufacturers also were not often given a fair chance to defend themselves .
`` The accused party needs to be given due process , a chance to confront the evidence against them and to present evidence on its own behalf , '' MacLeod said .
The FAA took notice , she said , and conducted a broad review of the program last year .
During that time , agency records show , the FAA did not post any notices about unapproved parts on its Web site .
Gilligan , the FAA deputy director , said the agency took a fresh look at its procedures last year because of the industry 's concerns .
The review , Gilligan acknowledged , delayed the issuance of the notice about Strandflex , but she said she could not estimate by how much .
In the end , she said , the agency concluded that it had the authority to issue the notices , as long as there was detailed evidence to suspect the parts were troubled .
It kept , unchanged , its procedures for notifying the airlines .
Gilligan said the delay in issuing the notice did not have any safety implications .
She said airlines are supposed to test the strength of the cable before they install it , and that pilots can compensate for a broken cable with other control systems .
The view that a broken cable would not pose a critical safety problem has been challenged by the National Transportation Safety Board , which insisted in investigations several years ago that the cables were crucial to flight safety .
In many passenger jets , steel cable is used to connect pilot controls with panels on the wings , known as ailerons .
By changing the position of the ailerons , a pilot can roll the plane to the right or left , which is typically the way airliners turn .
After a 1994 incident in which a failed cable caused an airliner to roll unexpectedly immediately after takeoff from Newark International Airport , the Safety Board argued that the failure pointed to an unsafe condition .
The FAA disagreed , saying that the flight crew was able to return to the airport under control and the odds of a repeat incident were minuscule .
In a November 1995 letter to the FAA , the chairman of the NTSB , Jim Hall , wrote : `` Although the flight tests demonstrated that the airplane is controllable with a failed cable , the Safety Board does not agree with the FAA 's assessment that this ` is not considered to be a safety issue ' and that no further action is warranted regarding maintenance procedures . ''
`` Further , the difficulties encountered by the Continental Airlines flight crew that resulted from the cable failure suggest that the possibility of a catastrophic accident is real . ''
Questions about Strandflex cable first arose in January 1999 , when a former employee sued the Oriskany , N.Y. , company , claiming it had failed to perform required quality tests and had used substandard material to make its cable .
The suit , which was joined this spring by the U.S. attorney in Syracuse , led to an investigation by the Department of Defense and the Justice Department .
In the suit , the employee , a former quality assurance manager , claimed that Strandflex skipped required tests designed to ensure strength and endurance and did not even own the equipment required to perform some of the checks .
In other cases , she said , the company used unapproved material , like cable lubricant , to make the cable .
The worker sued under a federal whistle-blower statute and stands to collect part of the damages if the case is successful .
In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Strandflex 's parent company acknowledged that it was under investigation , but said that there had never been a safety incident involving Strandflex cable and pledged to fight all the claims .
Soon after the woman filed her case , the Defense Department started an investigation of Strandflex cable purchased by the military .
In May 1999 , the department 's inspector general issued a safety alert about the cable , according to Donald V. McNamara , a special agent with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service .
Defense Department investigators tested a sample of the cable and found that it broke at roughly two-thirds of the minimum strength required by military specifications .
In the notice , the inspector general 's office advised all branches of the military that Strandflex cable might not have been properly tested and asked all units to inspect their aircraft for the cable .
In one case , the Air Force found Strandflex cable in the engine controls for a backup to Air Force Two and removed it .
The FAA began its own investigation in August 1999 .
At that time , the FAA judged that the aviation cable was a critical aircraft part and assigned the investigation its highest possible priority .
-LRB- Gilligan said the FAA has since changed its position on the importance of the part . -RRB-
The FAA investigator finished his work by the fall of 1999 , but it was not until last May that the FAA posted the alert on its Web site .
It was not obvious to airlines that they were Strandflex customers .
The cable is typically sold as part of an assembly that includes hooks and other hardware from wholesalers who do not necessarily say where each component was made .
The companies selling the complete assembly do so with the understanding that it meets FAA specifications .
Southwest Airlines , which has since removed Strandflex cable from a number of its aircraft , did not learn about the cable until a federal investigator called several weeks after the FAA issued its notice .
`` A special investigator with the Department of Defense called making a general inquiry if we knew anything about Strandflex or had Strandflex cabling on our aircraft , and that was about June 5 or 6 , '' said Linda Rutherford , a spokeswoman for Southwest .
`` We immediately became concerned and asked him to send us something in writing with everything that he knew , and it was after we received that that we began taking action . ''
Southwest said it had replaced the cable on several of its aircraft .
FAA officials said the airline and others that had performed the inspection found no problems .
When prosecutors in Syracuse discovered the lapse , they went to court and asked a judge for permission to warn the airlines themselves .
In a letter to Judge Howard G. Munson of the U.S. District Court in Syracuse , prosecutors said the FAA notice `` had not adequately reached its intended audience . ''
Although prosecutors commonly announce their findings after completing an case , legal experts say a decision to warn the public while a case is proceeding is unusual , although not unprecedented .
Typically , prosecutors do so when public safety becomes a concern during the course of the investigation .
`` It turns on whether the situation presents a life-threatening or health-threatening emergency , '' said Zachary W. Carter , the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York .
In this case , prosecutors made the decision to send letters directly to airlines and repair stations both in the United States and overseas .
In the letter to Munson , they said the direct notice `` served the purpose of ensuring public safety . ''
