LAGOS , December 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The federal government of Nigeria has reacted to the U.N. resolution on the Nigeria 's human rights situation , describing the pronouncement as '' unfortunate , unhelpful and unnecessary '' .
A statement issued by the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Ministry last night said the European Union -sponsored resolution is hasty , politically motivated and based on the emotional feelings of some influential members of the organization .
`` In an open affront on a sovereign nation , the sponsors of this resolution have conveniently ignored the fundamental principles of objectivity and nonselectivity which should guide the actions of the U.N. at all times , '' said the statement , quoted by the official newspaper `` New Nigerian '' today .
The U.N. general assembly expressed `` deep concern '' Thursday about the human rights situation in Nigeria and urged the government to take steps to rectify it .
The general assembly passed the resolution , criticizing alleged human rights violations in Nigeria and calling on the Nigerian government to release all detained political prisoners , trade union leaders , human rights advocates and journalists .
The resolution is the second following the general assembly adopted a similar one last year , but the language of the fresh one , according to the official News Agency of Nigeria , was toned down substantially following Nigeria 's counter-proposal reflecting the positive developments in the country .
`` After one year , '' said the statement , `` all those genuinely interested in the affairs of Nigeria need to embark on an objective analysis of the developments in our country in order to form a balanced view . ''
It said that since the submission of the report of the U.N. fact-finding mission to Nigeria earlier this year , the present administration has spared no efforts in responding constructively to the issues of interest to the international community on which un members just voted .
The statement reiterated the commitment of the administration to the pursuit of its programs of political and economic reforms which call for the establishment of durable peace , stability and development in the country .
The programs , which have led to the recent release of some well-known human rights activities , were embarked on by the government not in responding to any external pressure or demands but in the best interest of the Nigerian people , the statement added .
