<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Central Asian leaders blamed Afghanistan 's Taliban movement Monday for the region 's drug problem and appealed to the international community to help finance measures to curb the flow .</ENAMEX>
`` Tajikistan cannot single-handedly prevent the transit of drugs through its territory at the present time , '' President Emomali Rakhmonov told the opening day 's session of the U.N. General Assembly 's special session on drugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Tajikistan is a major transit point for opium -based drugs smuggled out of Afghanistan to the West .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Tajik president called on the international community to establish `` an anti-drug safety belt '' around Taliban -controlled parts of Afghanistan .
Rakhmonov said other countries of Central Asia had their hands full trying to curb smuggling across their border with his country , `` thus leaving our state alone to solve the problem of locating the starting point of drug trafficking from Afghanistan . ''
Afghanistan and Myanmar , formerly known as Burma , accounted for 90 percent of the world 's illicit opium production in 1997 .
The United Nations estimates that most of the heroin sold on the streets of Western Europe comes from Afghanistan .
The United Nations believes most of the crop is grown in Taliban -controlled areas .
The Taliban has agreed to work with the United Nations to curb production and encourage farmers to grow alternate crops .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In his speech to the General Assembly , deposed Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani accused the Taliban of encouraging opium poppey production .
`` The Taliban , in total defiance to all international norms and standards , openly devises a tax on the cultivation and export of poppies , '' Rabbani said .
`` Furthermore , to finance their infernal war machine , the Taliban are using newly transported refineries inside Afghanistan to transform raw opium into heroin . ''
The Taliban army seized 85 percent of the country last year and drove Rabbani from the capital Kabul .</ENAMEX>
But the General Assembly never withdrew the seat of the Rabbani government , meaning he is still recognized as the Afghan president , even though his northern alliance controls only 15 percent of the territory .
Last Friday , the Taliban 's unofficial mission in New York condemned Rabbani 's presence `` in the strongest terms . ''
