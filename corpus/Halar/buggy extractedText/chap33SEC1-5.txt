DEUTEROSTOMIA

 

 Phylum Echinodermata: Echinoderms have a water vascular system and secondary radial anatomy



 

 Phylum Chordata: The chordates include two invertebrate subphyla and all vertebrates



At first glance, sea stars and other echinoderms may seem to have little in common with the phylum Chordata, which includes the vertebrates: fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. These animals, however, share features characteristic of deuterostomes: radial cleavage, development of the coelom from the archenteron, and formation of the mouth at the end of the embryo opposite the blastopore (see FIGURE 32.7). Molecular systematics has reinforced Deuterostomia as a clade of bilaterian animals.
