THE SPATIAL SCALE OF DISTRIBUTIONS

 

 Different factors may determine the distribution of a species on different scales



 

 Most species have small geographic ranges



Throughout this chapter, we have examined abiotic factors, such as climate, and biotic factors, such as predation, that contribute to the distribution of the biosphere's diverse species. We have assumed that it is reasonably straightforward to map the geographic range of a species. But this assumption breaks down as we map the detailed distribution of a species in a local area. No species occurs everywhere throughout its range.
