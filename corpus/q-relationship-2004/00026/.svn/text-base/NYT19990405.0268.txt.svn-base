The United States will offer Russia another $ 100 million this week in an attempt to keep the international space station project on schedule .
Ostensibly , the money will purchase a three-man Soyuz crew capsule from the Russians to serve as an additional temporary lifeboat during the final stages of station assembly , a range of ground -based equipment that could be used at the Johnson Space Center to train spacewalking astronauts and other gear useful to NASA for the station .
But the real objective , NASA administrator Dan Goldin told Congress recently , is to keep the more crucial Russian contributions to the new station from slipping further behind schedule .
`` Russia 's fiscal realities continue to impede the Russian Space Agency 's ability to deliver its substantial contributions to the international space station in a timely manner , '' Goldin testified , referring to the financial crisis in the former Soviet Union .
The key issues that NASA intends to address this week in Moscow : The launch of the Russian service module , which is to furnish the living quarters and life support for the new station 's first crew of astronauts and cosmonauts .
Behind schedule 17 months because of flagging Russian finances , the service module is to lift off Sept. 20 .
Those within NASA who track its progress envision setbacks for the module during the final months of fabrication and ground testing .
Nonetheless , they believe it could be launched from Central Asia before the year is out .
Russia 's fabrication of the Soyuz rockets , Soyuz crew capsules and Progress cargo ships , a less visible issue though one that is vital to the first few years of the international station 's operations .
The new outpost requires a pair of Soyuz capsules annually to serve as lifeboats while they are docked .
Three propellant-laden Progress capsules are needed annually to fuel the propulsion systems that will keep the new station at safe altitudes above the Earth .
The demand for Progress capsules will grow to six annually after the turn of the century , though NASA began making plans to take over responsibility for future propellant requirements in response to last year 's Russian financial collapse .
The Mir space station .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">NASA wants the still-occupied , 13-year -old outpost safely ditched by September because it competes with the international station for scarce Russian government funding .
The Russians are in the final weeks of a so-far-unsuccessful bid to find a private source of funding to keep Mir operating for several more years .</ENAMEX>
Russian emotions run high for the preservation of Mir , but the country 's space agency has pledged to the United States that the aging outpost will not interfere with commitments to the international station .
In his appearance before Congress , Goldin said his agency is prepared to follow $ 60 million in payments to Russia last fall with $ 100 million in 1999 NASA funding .
He noted , however , that a plan to direct a total of $ 660 million to Russia over several years has been shelved .
There is no station funding for the Russians in the proposed NASA 2000 spending plan now before Congress .
Legislators must approve any funding agreements reached between the two space agencies .
If an agreement is reached , the latest monies would flow in installments as part of a purchase contract linked to carefully monitored milestones with regard to Mir and the service module , space agency officials said .
The more than five-year effort to assemble the new station began last November with the launching of the first component aboard a Russian Proton rocket from Central Asia .
American shuttle astronauts successfully joined a second component in December .
They are circling the Earth unstaffed at an altitude of about 250 miles , their electronic systems watched closely by ground control teams in Houston and suburban Moscow .
A U.S. shuttle supply mission to the fledgling outpost is planned for May .
But there is a backlog of U.S. components awaiting the arrival of Russia 's 21-ton service module , whose launching date slipped from July to September earlier this year , its third slip .
During the portion of the upcoming meeting called the general designer 's review , NASA will be looking for assurances that the $ 60 million it forwarded to Russia last year helped to assure a service module launching this year .
In exchange for those funds , NASA obtained partial use of the service module to conduct U.S. -sponsored research .
`` Clearly , we want to come out of the general designer 's review with an understanding that Mir is coming down in the August - September time frame , '' said Dan Hedin , chief of staff in NASA 's Washington space station development office .
`` We need a lot higher confidence as to when the service module is going to be delivered and a clear understanding of their financial capabilities . ''
As the two agencies prepare to convene , the service module is nearing a point in its ground testing that it can be transported by rail from its Moscow factory to the Baikonur Cosmodrome , Russia 's launch complex in Kazakhstan .
With no new snags , the service module should reach Baikonur around May 1 .
Once it reaches Baikonur , engineers will install the antenna for a communications system , satellite navigation equipment and a docking radar .
Those components will require about 30 additional ground tests to complete the module 's pre-launch checkout .
Once in orbit , the Russian service module will become a passive docking target for the station 's first modules .
Once linked , the newest module will provide living and working quarters for three .
