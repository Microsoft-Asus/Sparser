The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply.

The products of hydrolysis (ADP and <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../img/ufg/UFIG6-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" name="myUFIG6-1.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1"></td></tr></table>) are more stable than ATP. When a system changes in the direction of greater stability--when a compressed spring relaxes, for instance--the change is exergonic. Thus, the release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a more stable condition, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Why are the phosphate bonds so fragile? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.8a</span>, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a loaded spring.</p><p class="Header3">How ATP Performs Work</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In the cell, that would be an inefficient and dangerous use of a valuable energy resource. With the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis directly to endergonic processes by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule. The recipient of the phosphate group is then said to be <span class="Emphasis2">phosphorylated.</span> The key to the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original molecule. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.9</span> shows a cellular process that exemplifies this mechanism: the synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid (another amino acid) and ammonia.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig6-9','../fig/big/fig6-9.jpg','fig6-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig6-9.jpg" alt="fig6-9" name="myfig6-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 6-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Energy coupling by phosphate transfer.</span> In this example, ATP hydrolysis drives the conversion of the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) to another amino acid, glutamine (Glu--NH<SUB>2</SUB>).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">Nearly all cellular work depends on ATP’s energizing of other molecules by transferring phosphate groups.

The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell’s energy-yielding processes to the energy-producing ones. The ATP cycle moves at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP about once each minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would consume nearly their body weight in ATP each day.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig6-10','../fig/big/fig6-10.jpg','fig6-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig6-10.jpg" alt="fig6-10" name="myfig6-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 6-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The ATP cycle.</span> Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP.
