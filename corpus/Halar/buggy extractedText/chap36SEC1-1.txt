AN OVERVIEW OF TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN PLANTS

 

 Transport at the cellular level depends on the selective permeability of membranes



 

 Proton pumps play a central role in transport across plant membranes



 

 Differences in water potential drive water transport in plant cells



 

 Aquaporins affect the rate of water transport across membranes



 

 Vacuolated plant cells have three major compartments



 

 Both the symplast and the apoplast function in transport within tissues and organs



 

 Bulk flow functions in long-distance transport



Transport in plants occurs on three levels: (1) the uptake and loss of water and solutes by individual cells, such as the absorption of water and minerals from the soil by cells of a root; (2) short-distance transport of substances from cell to cell at the level of tissues and organs, such as the loading of sugar from photosynthetic cells of a mature leaf into the sieve tubes of phloem; and (3) long-distance transport of sap within xylem and phloem at the level of the whole plant. FIGURE 36.1 provides an overview of the major transport processes in whole plants.
