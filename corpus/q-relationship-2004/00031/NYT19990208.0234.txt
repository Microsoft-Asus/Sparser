AMMAN , Jordan --
Hailing the late King Hussein as a symbol of history and a man of peace , President Clinton headed an extraordinary array of world leaders on Monday who helped this desert kingdom lay to rest the monarch that led it through nearly five rocky decades in the troubled heart of the fractious Middle East .
Clinton called on those leaders , collectively and individually , to build on Hussein 's legacy by working to bring an end to half a century of enmity and war across an ancient and blood-stained region that gave birth to three of the world 's great religions .
After a 25-minute meeting with Hussein 's son and successor , King Abdullah , Clinton said he had `` great confidence , '' in the 37-year -old monarch 's ability to guide this nation of 4.4 million and maintain its close military , political and economic ties to the United States .
Clinton was joined by former U.S. Presidents Ford , Carter and Bush , in a symbol , Clinton said , of the importance Americans attach to their relationship with Jordan .
`` America 's interests and America 's heart were close to this king and this country , '' Clinton told a couple hundred U.S. Embassy personnel gathered here Monday night .
`` I have great confidence in the young king of Jordan , '' Clinton said .
`` He clearly understands his mission . ''
Clinton made his remarks after attending a day of funeral services , condolence sessions and casual , off-the-cuff conversations with dozens of heads of state that came here to pay their last respects to Hussein .
They joined hundreds of thousands of grief-stricken Jordanians who lined up five people deep along narrow streets and broad boulevards , as Hussein 's funeral procession wound through more than 12 miles of this low-rise capital of sandstone and marble .
Dignitaries in dark suits and Jordanians from all walks of life , their red and white checkered keffiyeh -LRB- head scarves -RRB- streaming from their heads , turned out on a chilly but sun-splashed day to watch Hussein 's body pass by , borne in a small wooden coffin draped with the red , white , green and black flag of Jordan .
Bedouin soldiers paid full military honors to Hussein , who died Sunday of cancer at the age of 63 , after ruling this country for 47 often tumultuous years .
By the time he was laid to rest in a simple cotton shroud amid the cypress and pine trees in the hilltop family cemetery where his grandfather , Abdullah , and his father , Talal , are buried , only a small cadre of Muslim men were nearby .
Clinton and other foreign dignitaries were kept a respectful distance from the gravesite , and women , including Hussein 's American -born wife , Queen Noor , were forbidden to come near , in accordance with Islamic tradition .
Shortly after dark , the haunting tones of the nightly Islamic call to prayer boomed out from loudspeakers and echoed across the stark but immaculately kept palace grounds .
The most gripping public moment occurred , however , when Queen Noor stepped through the cream-colored columns of the ornate Raghadan Palace , with her two daughters Iman and Rayah and Hussein 's daughter by an earlier marriage , Haya , at her side , all draped in dark flowing mourning garb , their heads covered with matching white shawls .
Sensing that her younger daughter , Rayah , was shaken by the event and a sudden crush of cameras , the Queen leaned over and gave the child a spontaneous kiss on her forehead , ushered the girls into a metallic blue Mercedes , hopped into the driver 's seat and wheeled off into the night .
A few minutes later , First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , who had been meeting with the queen while Clinton met with Abdullah , stepped into the polished marble palace foyer , greeted the grieving young king , then walked out into a starlit night with the president and into a waiting presidential limousine .
If it was a day of grieving the loss of Hussein , however , it was also a day of casual diplomacy for Clinton , who found himself surrounded by some 50 heads of states from every continent and every corner of the Arab world .
No major successes were claimed , but the sheer variety of leaders present offered Clinton a unique opportunity to burnish his personal relationship with a remarkable array of his counterparts .
`` I do n't know whether there has ever been such a large delegation of leaders from around the world for the funeral of any leader , '' said Clinton 's National Security Adviser , Samuel `` Sandy '' Berger .
`` The kaleidoscope of the world was here . ''
Clinton said the international showing was a tribute to Hussein 's ability to bring together leaders with disparate goals and unite them in common purpose .
`` It was really a beautiful sight , people coming from all around the world , countries that are at each other 's throats , here meeting in peace and friendship and the sanctity of the umbrella of this great man , '' Clinton said .
Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
He chatted with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac about ongoing efforts to end bloodshed in Kosovo .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin greeted Clinton with a hearty greeting , hollering out `` Beeel Cleenton , '' in `` his big bear voice , '' as Clinton walked into a large tent that served as a meeting place for foreign dignitaries , said Berger .
Clinton also met one-on-one with Syrian President Hafez al- Assad , who led an attack on Jordan in 1970 in a purported effort to aid the members of the Palestine Liberation Organization living in Jordan .
`` The president said , you know , ` I want you to , I hope you will support Jordan , ' '' Berger recounted to reporters .
`` And he -LRB- Assad -RRB- said , ` Yes . '
But I mean , you know , I could n't see in his heart . ''
The funeral also brought Clinton together with three of his four surviving predecessors .
The presidents , who all flew over aboard the presidential aircraft , Air Force One , spent much of their time together recalling their own efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East .
`` They 've literally spent the whole day together , '' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart .
`` Throughout the day they have walked as a group , joined each other 's conversations , '' he said .
`` For President Clinton , it 's been a great opportunity to draw upon the vast knowledge and expertise that this group has . ''
