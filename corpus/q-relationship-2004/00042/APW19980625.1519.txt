HONG KONG
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Images of a rite of passage stick in the mind : the majestic lowering of the Union Jack and the raising of a red banner ; a solemn Prince Charles and smiling Communist Party officials , formally ending 150 years of colonialism .
The handover of Hong Kong last July 1 was a signal event of the close of the 20th century and posed an open question for the 21st : Can a community of free expression and wide-open markets survive within a huge and restrictive communist society ?
So far , the answer is a qualified yes .
Year One under Chinese rule has been full of nasty surprises .
But daily life has been affected less by Beijing than by a regional economic contagion that began in Thailand .
An influenza virus provoked more worry than the People 's Liberation Army .
Beijing 's capacity for mischief now seems less of an issue than the Hong Kong government 's own democratic credentials , or the territory 's economic troubles .
What adversity there has been in Hong Kong has helped bring subtle , yet potentially profound change .
A ruling pro- Beijing elite is under pressure to listen to its opponents and to seek support of average people -- who are dispelling assumptions of political apathy .
For the first time in any corner of communist China , the outline of a social contract may be emerging .
`` Hong Kong is n't a colony anymore , and the colonial ` good enough ' rates of consultation and participation are not ` good enough ' anymore , '' Michael DeGolyer , a political analyst charting Hong Kong 's transition , said in a report .
Nearly everyone agreed that Beijing largely has kept hands off .
Some labor laws were repealed , and some restrictions were placed on demonstrations -- although none have been banned .
China 's Xinhua news agency , thought to be the secret locus of the Communist Party , was exempted from the territory 's laws .
Yet on May 24 a record 53 percent of registered voters turned out for legislative elections .
A majority backed candidates seeking more democracy .
On June 4 , just as they have since 1989 , tens of thousands of people turned out to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre .
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the demonstration was none of Beijing 's business .
Economically , Hong Kong has followed much of Asia into recession .
Unemployment is at a 15-year high , and the stock market 's key index is down 50 percent .
`` The government seems to want to do a lot , but it has n't been able to deliver , '' said Chan Ka -yan , a 25-year -old technician .
`` They 're changing their policies all the time . ''
Politically , Hong Kong never has been a democracy -- either under British or Chinese rule .
Critics say that suits the temperament of Chief Executive Tung Chee -hwa and his team .
`` Instead of saying , ` Do we have to restrict freedom ; is it necessary to restrict freedom under these circumstances ? ' , they ask , ` Can we justify restriction of freedom ? ' '' said Margaret Ng , who will represent lawyers in the new legislature .
But Sonny Lo , an analyst at Hong Kong University , said Tung actually protects Hong Kong because he `` understands the bottom line of Beijing . ''
Tung has run into his biggest troubles on home affairs , and it is here that Hong Kong may develop the give-and-take of a mature political system .
Tung was widely criticized for letting subordinates deal with the `` bird flu , '' a virus that doctors feared could migrate from poultry and kill people .
Eventually , they decided to kill off all the territory 's chickens .
As the economy wilted , frequent small protests demanded action .
One common , if disputed , interpretation is that the record electoral turnout was a huge vote of no-confidence .
A recent poll indicated Tung was less popular than the last British governor .
Officials now appear more concerned about public opinion .
Two economic packages quickly followed news that Hong Kong was headed for recession .
They include spending aimed at helping new home buyers and and medium-size businesses .
DeGolyer derided the assumption that Hong Kong was politically passive .
Its people never had a way to influence the system under the British , he said .
Now they may have one .
After the elections , the traditional pro- Beijing , pro-business faction that has run Hong Kong may sometimes split .
Grassroots pro- China politicians may cooperate with government critics to demand more social spending .
If they do , they will come very close to a legislative majority .
The government also will face persistent demands from directly elected legislators to speed up the transition to direct elections for all 60 seats .
The road ahead could be perilous .
China is beginning a tortuous economic transformation that could lead to widespread unrest .
Martin Lee , Hong Kong 's de facto opposition leader , said the lesson of Tiananmen is that when the Beijing power elite feels threatened , it cracks down -- regardless of consequences .
DeGolyer said local business interests must decide whether to hang onto positions and influence , or try to build a mainstream party and earn their influence in elections .
Asia has several examples of what happens when unelected and unaccountable officials frustrate the will of the majority , he said .
One is stagnant Japan , where bureaucracy dominates .
The other is Indonesia , where social unrest just toppled a long-ruling president .
