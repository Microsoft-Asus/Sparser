VIENNA , Austria
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Some relief could be at hand for motorists bitter about the sharply higher prices they 've had to pay for a fillup since March of last year .
OPEC oil ministers were nearing a consensus Sunday on the need to boost output in order to rein in soaring petroleum prices and mollify the United States and other oil-importing nations .
Although the ministers refused to confirm the size or timing of any such increase , Kuwait 's oil minister , Sheikh Saud Nasser al- Sabah , said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to raise its official output by as much as 1.7 million barrels of crude a day .
The 11 OPEC ministers will meet today to decide whether to extend production cuts made in 1998 and 1999 that have propelled oil prices to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf War .
The latest round of cuts expires at the end of the month .
The United States is hoping for an even bigger increase in output than what appeared to be under discussion .
High prices for gasoline and home heating oil have become a hot political issue in this American election year , and Washington has applied intense diplomatic pressure to try to persuade OPEC member countries to open their taps further .
OPEC ministers met privately in small groups in an effort to resolve differences ahead of today 's semiannual meeting .
`` We are arriving to a consensus , '' Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez told reporters at a downtown hotel .
He refused to elaborate .
Al - Sabah , the Kuwaiti minister , said later that OPEC members were talking about a possible increase of 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels a day .
However , any official increase would not be as large as it may seem due to the more than 1 million `` unofficial '' barrels that OPEC members are currently pumping each day .
This cheating on production quotas means that a daily increase of 1.7 million barrels would only add about 600,000 barrels of actual new oil to the market .
OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day , or about 35 percent of the world 's supply .
The U.S. and other oil-importing countries are hoping OPEC will raise production by 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day .
Many industry analysts worry that OPEC wo n't produce enough to let consuming nations replenish their meager oil inventories and simultaneously meet higher seasonal needs for gasoline .
American motorists now pay an average of $ 1.59 per gallon for unleaded gasoline , an increase of nearly 60 cents since prices bottomed out at 99.8 cents per gallon in February 1999 , according to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 U.S. gas stations released Saturday .
Industry analysts warn of possible shortages and $ 2-a-gallon gas during the peak driving season this summer .
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson recently visited eight OPEC countries to lobby for greater production as a way of easing prices down from nine-year-highs .
But Iran 's oil minister on Saturday urged OPEC to resist U.S. diplomatic efforts .
`` U.S. pressures are meaningless to us .
We hope OPEC members will not give in to political pressures , '' the Iranian minister , Bijan Namdar Zanganeh , told state-run Tehran radio in Vienna .
Zanganeh said OPEC producers must set aside political considerations and make decisions today based on their national and economic interests .
Iran is a major OPEC producer , second only to Saudi Arabia .
The Saudis want to stabilize prices at a level that wo n't cause extreme economic pain for the nations that buy its oil .
If high prices start damaging economies , producers fear demand for oil will plunge and that OPEC 's earnings from crude oil sales could evaporate .
Some other OPEC members , including Libya and Algeria , have been reluctant to support an increase in output because they are already producing at levels near their physical limits .
Non - OPEC producers that have cut output in tandem with the cartel , such as Mexico and Norway , favor higher production but are waiting first to see what OPEC does .
Still , oil prices are the product of a multitude of factors .
Unexpectedly warm weather this spring , for example , could offset an increase in OPEC 's output by causing an early spike in the demand for gasoline .
`` They 're still thinking they can fine-tune production and somehow get prices to do what they want them to do , '' said Bill Edwards of Houston -based Edwards Energy Consultants .
`` They ca n't . ''
A subcommittee of three OPEC members -- Iran , Kuwait and Nigeria -- met late Sunday and determined that the group was 75 percent compliant with its production cuts in February .
The subcommittee was likely to recommend a production policy to other members today .
