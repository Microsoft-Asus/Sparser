India will launch its first nuclear-powered submarine around 2006 or 2007 , Jane 's Defense Weekly reported Wednesday .
Following nuclear tests in May by India and its rival neighbor , Pakistan , New Delhi is now pressing ahead with the submarine program which was started in the late 1970s , so it can deliver nuclear weapons .
The nuclear reactor for the submarine , built by the Department of Atomic Energy at the Bhaba Atomic Research Center in Trombay , will begin tests at the Kalapakkam atomic research center near Madras in southern India within 12 months , Jane 's said .
Quoting official sources , the respected military magazine said the submarine 's keel will be laid by 2002 , two years after the completion of land tests on the nuclear reactor .
The first nuclear-powered submarine will be launched in 2006 or 2007 and commissioned a year later , Jane 's quoted the sources as saying .
The submarine will serve as a platform for nuclear-armed missiles like the Sagarika , a cruise missile which is in an advanced stage of development , official sources were quoted as saying .
Rahul Roy - Chaudhury , a naval analyst at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi , was quoted as saying the submarine 's capabilities will outstrip those of Pakistan 's navy .
Pakistan will soon bring into service three French -designed Agosta 90B submarines equipped with independent propulsion systems for enhanced submerged endurance , he was quoted as saying .
The emerging strategic challenge from China will give the new Indian submarine `` a crucial role in surveillance and deterrent operations off the eastern straits of Malacca and Singapore by 2010 , '' Jane 's quoted Roy - Chaudhury as saying .
The Indian project is based on Russia 's Charlie class nuclear-powered submarine , but India must modify the design to ensure compatibility with its locally produced reactor , Jane 's said .
The Indian navy leased the Chakra , a Charlie class nuclear-powered sub , from the former Soviet Union in 1988 and returned it in 1991 .
India had planned to acquire four to six nuclear-powered submarines but the disintegration of the Soviet Union put an end to the plans and the government decided to accelerate its own program , Jane 's said .
Indian navy sources were quoted by the magazine as saying that the main problems facing the program were funding , miniaturization of the nuclear reactor and providing suitable containment .
According to Jane 's , Russia has not given India the blueprints for the reactor as that would violate the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty .
