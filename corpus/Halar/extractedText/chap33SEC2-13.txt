 Phylum Chordata: The chordates include two invertebrate subphyla and all vertebrates

This phylum, to which we belong, consists of two subphyla of invertebrate animals plus the subphylum Vertebrata, the animals with backbones. Grouping the chordates with echinoderms as deuterostomes on the basis of similarities in early embryonic development is not meant to imply that one phylum evolved from the other. Chordates and echinoderms have existed as distinct phyla for at least half a billion years; if the developmental similarities stem from shared ancestry, then the evolutionary paths of the two phyla must have diverged very early. We will trace the phylogeny of chordates in Chapter 34, focusing on the history of vertebrates.

TABLE 33.7 summarizes the animal phyla we have discussed in this chapter.

Table 33-7. Animal Phyla

CategoryPhylaDescription of PhylaKingdom Animalia ParazoaPorifera (sponges)



Choanocytes (collar cells--unique flagellated cells that ingest bacteria and tiny food particles); cells tend to be totipotent (retain zygote's potential to form the whole animal)Eumetazoa RadiataCnidaria (hydras, jellies, sea anemones, corals)



Unique stinging structures (cnidae), each housed in a specialized cell (cnidocyte); gastrovascular cavity (incomplete digestive tract with a mouth but no anus)Ctenophora (comb jellies)



Colloblasts (adhesive structures) for prey capture; eight rows of comblike ciliary plates; gastrovascular cavityBilateria Protostomia: LophotrochozoaPlatyhelminthes (flatworms)



Dorsoventrally flattened, unsegmented acoelomates; gastrovascular cavity or no disgestive tractRotifera (rotifers)



Pseudocoelomates with complete digestive tracts; jaws in pharynx structures (trophi); head with a cilated crown (corona); no circulatory systemLophophorates: Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, Phoronida



Coelomates with lophophore (feeding structure bearing cilated tentacles)Nemertea (proboscis worms)



Unique anterior proboscis surrounded by fluid-filled cavity (rhynchocoel); complete digestive tract (mouth and anus); circulatory system with closed vesselsMollusca (clams, snails, squids)



Coelomates with three main body parts (muscular foot, visceral mass, mantle); coelom reduced; main body cavity is a hemocoelAnnelida (segmented worms)



Coelomates with body wall and internal organs (except digestive tract) segmentedProtostomia: EcdysozaNematoda (roundworms)



Cylindrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates with tapered ends; no circulatory systemArthropoda (crustaceans, insects, spiders)



Coelomates with segmented body, jointed appendages, exoskeleton from ectodermDeuterostomiaEchinodermata (sea stars, sea urchins)



Coelomates with secondary radial anatomy (larvae bilateral; adults radial); unique water vascular system; endoskeletonChordata (lancelets, tunicates, vertebrates)



Coelomates with notochord; dorsal hollow nerve cord; pharyngeal slits; muscular postanal tail
