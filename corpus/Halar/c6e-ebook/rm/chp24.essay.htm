									<a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">In the margin of one of his notebooks, Darwin scrawled a note to remind himself never to apply the terms "higher" or "lower" to species. It was, and is still, very common for people to think of some species or species groups as more or less evolved than others. This probably stems from a notion of evolutionary "progress." Is there such a thing as evolutionary progress? Why or why not? Defend your position as if you were debating someone holding the opposite view.</p>

									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">Cultivated American cotton plants have a total of 52 chromosomes (2<span class="Emphasis1">n</span> = 52). In each cell, 13 pairs of chromosomes are smaller than the rest. Old World cotton plants have 26 chromosomes (2<span class="Emphasis1">n</span> = 26), all large. Wild American cotton plants have 26 chromosomes, all small. Propose a hypothesis to explain how cultivated American cotton may have originated. How could you test your hypothesis?</p>
