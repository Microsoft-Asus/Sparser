Albania 's foreign minister called Friday for NATO intervention in Kosovo and said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be held accountable for genocide and investigated for war crimes .
Speaking to the U.N. General Assembly , Paskal Milo said immediate NATO action is necessary `` because of the failure of the peaceful means applied by the international community so far . ''
`` It is high time for the U.N. and other international organizations to urgently intervene for the restoration of peace , otherwise we risk to have another wider conflict , '' he warned .
Milo accused Milosevic of ordering `` the implementation of his ethnic cleansing policy against Albanians under the pretext of combating the so-called Albanian terrorism . ''
The Albanian government urged the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia `` to start the investigation for the indictment of Milosevic as a war criminal , '' the minister said .
A crackdown by Serb security forces on ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern Serb province has left hundreds dead and more than 270,000 homeless since it began in February .
Serbia , the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation , accuses Albania of backing the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army and supplying them with arms .
Milo said thousands of Kosovo Albanians have fled to Albania and thousands more were wandering Kosovo 's forests and mountains , creating an acute humanitarian crisis .
The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned recent massacres of ethnic Albanians , but did not assign blame and added no new legal backing for any NATO action .
It demanded compliance with resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of special Serb police forces sent to Kosovo , where ethnic Albanians , who comprise 90 percent of the province , are seeking independence .
In his speech , Milo accused Serbian propaganda of trying to justify indiscriminate attacks and the massacre of ethnic Albanians -- just as it did in Bosnia -- by making false accusations of terrorist activity .
`` The Albanian government strongly condemns this policy and openly declares that Milosevic should be taken accountable and responsible for genocide , '' he said .
Milo insisted that Albania wants a peaceful end to the Kosovo conflict .
`` We are in favor of an immediate end of the conflict and the initiation of the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina , with an international involvement as a third party , '' Milo said .
`` This would guarantee their success .
The negotiations should define the future status of Kosovo . ''
The Albanian government believes a solution `` should take into consideration the respect of the will of the Albanians to self-determination and the respect for the international conventions which reject the violent changing of borders , '' he said .
On domestic matters , Milo said the Albanian government was `` working diligently '' to establish the long-term rule of law after months of unrest .
Albania is still trying to recover from nationwide riots that exploded in 1997 after pyramid investment schemes collapsed , depriving many Albanians of their life savings .
Milo expressed hope that the Albanian people will be able to vote on a proposed draft constitution , which recognizes the need to share political power and secure human rights , by the end of the year .
The adoption of a constitution -- ratified by the people -- that recognizes `` the fundamental rule of law and protects liberties , '' offers the best hope for the future of Albania , Milo said .
