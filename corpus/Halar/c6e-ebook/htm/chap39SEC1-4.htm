A seed, landing upside down in the soil, cannot maneuver itself into an upright position. Because of their immobility, plants must adjust to a wide range of environmental circumstances through developmental and physiological mechanisms. Natural selection has refined these responses. Light is so important in the life of a plant that we devoted the entire previous section to a plant’s reception of and response to this one environmental factor. In this section, we examine responses to some of the other environmental stimuli that a plant commonly faces in its "struggle for existence."</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
