 Sexual and asexual reproduction are complementary in the life histories of many plants

Many plants are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and each offers advantages in certain situations. Sex generates variation in a population, an asset in an environment where evolving pathogens and other variables affect survival and reproductive success. An additional benefit of sexual reproduction in plants is the seed, which can disperse to new locations and can also wait to grow until hostile environmental conditions have improved.

An advantage of asexual reproduction is that a plant well suited to a particular environment can clone many copies of itself rapidly. Moreover, the offspring of vegetative reproduction, usually mature fragments of the parent plant, are not as frail as the seedlings produced by sexual reproduction. A sprawling clone of prairie grass may cover an area so thoroughly that seedlings of the same or other species have little chance of competing. But in the soil is a pool of seeds, waiting in the wings for some cue to germinate. After a fire, drought, or some other disturbance clears patches of the turf, seedlings can finally get a foothold when conditions improve. The seedlings are unequal in their traits, for their genotypes are products of the sexual recombination of genes. A new competition ensues, in which certain plants excel and clone themselves. Both modes of reproduction, sexual and asexual, have contributed to the success of plants in diverse terrestrial environments.
