It is also necessary to weigh a species’ biological and ecological needs against other conflicting demands. Conservation biology often highlights the relationship between science, technology, and society--one of the themes of this book. For example, an ongoing, sometimes bitter debate in the U.S. Pacific Northwest pits saving habitat for populations of the northern spotted owl, timber wolf, grizzly bear, and bull trout against demands for jobs in the timber, mining, and other resource extraction industries. Programs to restock wolves in Yellowstone and to bolster the populations of grizzly bears and other large carnivores are opposed by some recreationists concerned for their safety and by many ranchers concerned with potential losses of livestock.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Large, high-profile vertebrates are not always the focal point in these conflicts, but habitat use is almost always at issue. Should work proceed on a new highway bridge if it destroys the only remaining habitat of a species of freshwater mussel? If you were the owner of a coffee plantation growing varieties that thrive in bright sunlight, do you think you would be willing to change to shade-tolerant coffee varieties that are less productive and less profitable but support large numbers of songbirds?</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">In addition to questions about human habitat needs, another important factor to weigh is the ecological role of species. Because we will not be able to save every endangered species, we must determine which ones are most important for conserving biodiversity as a whole. Species do not exert equal influence on community and ecosystem processes. Some organisms, called <span class="Emphasis1">keystone species</span>, have disproportionately large impacts relative to their numbers (see Chapter 53). Some keystone species significantly modify habitats, creating diverse patches that support numerous other species. Keystone mutualists provide other species with nutrients, defense against predators and parasites, or, in the case of pollinators, the means to reproduce. Identifying keystone species and finding ways to sustain their populations can ensure the continuance of numerous other species and can be central to the survival of whole communities. Conservation must move beyond its preoccupation with single species like the northern spotted owl and look at the whole community and ecosystem as an important unit of biodiversity.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
