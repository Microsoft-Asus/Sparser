When you view a lush landscape, such as the Tasmanian forest scene in the photo above, it is difficult to picture the land without any macroscopic organisms. But that is how we must imagine Earth for almost the first 90%  of the time life has existed. Life was cradled in the seas and ponds, and there it evolved in confinement for 3 billion years. Paleobiologists have discovered fossils of cyanobacteria that coated moist soil about 1.2 billion years ago, but the long evolutionary pilgrimage of more complex organisms onto land did not begin until about 500 million years ago. The terrestrial communities founded by plants transformed the biosphere. Consider, for example, that humans would not exist had it not been for the chain of evolutionary events that began when certain descendants of green algae first colonized land.

The evolutionary history of the plant kingdom is a story of adaptation to changing terrestrial conditions. That is the historical context in which this chapter and the next survey the current diversity of plants and trace their origins.





AN OVERVIEW OF LAND PLANT EVOLUTION

 

 Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants



 

 Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants



 

 Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae



More than 280,000 species of plants inhabit Earth today. Though some species, such as sea grasses, have returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution, most plants live in terrestrial environments, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests. For now, we will refer to all of these organisms as land plants, even those that are now aquatic, to distinguish them from the algae we discussed as photosynthetic protists in Chapter 28. But land plants did indeed evolve from certain green algae called charophyceans, and we will explore this phylogenetic connection later in the chapter. This section introduces the diversity of modern land plants in the context of their terrestrial adaptations.

THE ORIGIN OF VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors



 

 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago



You learned earlier in the chapter that modern vascular plants include the ferns and related plants (pteridophytes), gymnosperms, and flowering plants (angiosperms). And recall that vascular plants are equipped with food-transporting phloem as well as water-conducting xylem tissue with lignified cells. Vascular plants also differ from bryophytes in having a dominant sporophyte generation and branched sporophytes that become independent of parental gametophytes. Pteridophytes are described as seedless vascular plants because, unlike gymnosperms and angiosperms, they do not produce seeds. The first vascular plants were seedless (see FIGURE 29.1).





PTERIDOPHYTES: SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves



 

 A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants



 

 Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants



 

 Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period



The two phyla of seedless vascular plants represented in the modern flora are the phylum Lycophyta (lycophytes) and phylum Pterophyta (ferns, whisk ferns, and horsetails). These two phyla probably had separate origins from different ancestors among the early vascular plants. Thus, the term "pteridophyte" is an informal one for all seedless vascular plants, while "Pterophyta" is the formal name for one seedless plant phylum, the ferns and their relatives. FIGURE 29.21 illustrates examples of pteridophytes.

Fig 29-21. Examples of pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). The phyla Lycophyta and Pterophyta probably evolved from different ancient vascular plants. Based on recent evidence that whisk ferns, horsetails, and ferns make up a monophyletic group of seedless vascular plants, many plant systematists now place them all in the single phylum Pterophyta. All of the plants illustrated here are sporophytes, the dominant forms in the life cycles of all vascular plants.





 Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants

There are four main groups of land plants: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. The most common bryophytes are the mosses. The pteridophytes include the ferns. Pines and other conifers (cone-bearing plants) are the most familiar gymnosperms. The angiosperms are the flowering plants. Studying these four plant groups provides perspective for understanding the history of life in general, since each plant group originated at a distinct time in Earth's past.

Mosses and other bryophytes are distinguished from algae by several features derived during evolutionary adaptation to living on land. Many of these adaptations are reproductive. For example, when bryophytes and all other land plants reproduce, the offspring develop from multicellular embryos that remain attached to the "mother" plant, which protects and nourishes the embryos.

Additional adaptations distinguish the other major groups of land plants from the bryophytes. An example is the vascular tissue that evolved in an ancestor common to pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. This derived character and others unite these three plant groups in a clade known as the vascular plants (see Chapter 25 to review derived homologies and cladistics). In vascular tissue, cells are joined into tubes that transport water and nutrients throughout the plant body. Most bryophytes lack vascular tissue and hence are sometimes referred to as "nonvascular plants," in contrast to the vascular plants. This distinction is not entirely accurate, however, for water-conducting tubes are present in some bryophytes. (Later, we will examine some derived features that more accurately mark the "vascular plant" clade.)

Among vascular plants, ferns and other pteridophytes are sometimes called seedless plants because there is no seed stage in their life cycles. In contrast, gymnosperms and angiosperms are seed plants. The evolution of the seed in an ancestor common to gymnosperms and angiosperms added an adaptation that facilitated reproduction on land.

A seed consists of a plant embryo packaged along with a food supply within a protective coat. The first vascular plants with seeds evolved about 360 million years ago, near the end of the Devonian period. Their seeds were not enclosed in any specialized chambers. These early seed plants gave rise to the diversity of present-day gymnosperms (from the Greek gymnos, naked, and sperma, seed), including the conifers.

The evolution of flowers led to further diversification of plants beginning in the early Cretaceous period about 130 million years ago. The flower is a complex reproductive structure that bears seeds within protective chambers called ovaries. This contrasts with the bearing of naked seeds by gymnosperms. The great majority of modern-day plant species are flowering plants, or angiosperms (from the Greek angion, container, and sperma, seed).

Thus, we can trace the bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms of today to four great evolutionary episodes in the history of land plants: the origin of bryophytes from algal ancestors; the origin and diversification of vascular plants; the origin of seeds; and the evolution of flowers. The hypothetical phylogeny in FIGURE 29.1 places the phyla of land plants in this evolutionary context. The taxonomic scheme we'll use in this chapter and the next recognizes a total of ten plant phyla (TABLE 29.1). Before we take a closer look at these diverse plant phyla, let's distinguish land plants from other photosynthetic organisms and then continue our exploration of the terrestrial adaptations that made it possible for plants to colonize land.

 Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants

How can we define land plants? What features do bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms have in common that distinguish them from other organisms? Plants are multicellular, eukaryotic, photosynthetic autotrophs. However, red seaweeds and brown seaweeds also fit this description (see Chapter 28). Cell walls made of cellulose and the presence of chlorophylls a and b within chloroplasts are often cited as defining characteristics of plants. But cellulose walls are also present in several algal groups, including dinoflagellates and brown algae. And even those green algae that are not closely related to land plants have chloroplasts with both chlorophylls a and b, as do the euglenoids and some dinoflagellates. So we must look to other features to distinguish land plants from algae.

An electron microscopic view of cells reveals two key ultrastructural features that land plants share only with the green algae that are their closest relatives, the algal group called the charophyceans (FIGURE 29.2). First, the plasma membranes of land plants and charophyceans are equipped with rose-shaped arrays of proteins that synthesize the cellulose microfibrils of the cell walls. These rosette cellulose-synthesizing complexes contrast with the linear arrays of cellulose-producing proteins characteristic of noncharophycean algae. This distinction suggests that the cellulose walls of an ancestor common to charophyceans and land plants evolved independently of the cellulose walls of other algae, including most green algae (except charophyceans).

Fig 29-2. Charophyceans, closest algal relatives of the plant kingdom.

A second derived homology in charophyceans and land plants is a match in the enzymes contained within the organelles called peroxisomes, which are often closely associated with chloroplasts (see FIGURE 7.19). These peroxisome enzymes help minimize the loss of organic product due to photorespiration (see Chapter 10). Except for the charophyceans, algal peroxisomes lack these enzymes.

Two additional derived homologies link land plants to the charophycean algae. In those land plants that have flagellated sperm cells, the structure of the sperm closely resembles the sperm of charophyceans. And certain details of cell division are common only to land plants and the most complex of the charophycean algae, such as Chara and Coleochaete, shown in FIGURE 29.2. For example, the synthesis of new cross-walls (cell plates) during cell division involves the formation of a phragmoplast, an alignment of cytoskeletal elements and Golgi-derived vesicles across the midline of the dividing cell (see FIGURE 12.9).

Clearly, we are starting to build a case for a close relationship between charophycean algae and land plants, and we will strengthen our case when we explore the origin of land plants later in the chapter. But for now we search for features unique to land plants--characteristics that distinguish land plants from their closest relatives--for those are the plant features most likely to be associated with terrestrial adaptation.





 Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae

Several characteristics are common to all four land plant groups--bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms--but are absent in even their closest algal relatives, the charophyceans. Here we'll examine five derived characters unique to land plants.

Apical Meristems, Producers of a Plant's Tissues

In terrestrial habitats, the resources that a photosynthetic organism needs are found in two very different places. Light and carbon dioxide are mainly available aboveground; water and mineral nutrients are found mainly in the soil. Thus, the complex bodies of plants show varying degrees of structural specialization for subterranean and aerial organs--roots and leaf-bearing shoots, respectively, in most plants.

Though plants cannot move from place to place, the elongation and branching of their shoots and roots maximize their exposure to environmental resources. This growth in length is sustained throughout the life of a plant by the activity of apical meristems, localized regions of cell division at the tips of shoots and roots (FIGURE 29.3). Cells produced by these meristems differentiate into the plant's various tissues, including a surface epidermis that protects the body and several types of internal tissues. Shoot meristems also generate leaves in most plants.

Multicellular, Dependent Embryos

Multicellular plant embryos develop from zygotes that are retained within tissues of the female parent (FIGURE 29.4). The parental tissues provide the developing embryo with nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids. The embryo has specialized placental transfer cells, sometimes present in the adjacent maternal tissue as well, which enhance the transfer of nutrients from parent to embryo (FIGURE 29.5). This interface is analogous to the nutrient-transferring embryo-mother interface of eutherian (placental) mammals. Land plants are also known as embryophytes, a distinction that recognizes multicellular, dependent embryos as a derived characteristic common to the land plant clade.

Alternation of Generations

During the life cycles of all land plants, two multicellular body forms alternate, each form producing the other. This type of reproductive cycle, called alternation of generations, also evolved in various groups of algae (see FIGURE 28.24). However, alternation of generations does not occur in the charophyceans, the algae most closely related to land plants. We can infer from this observation that alternation of generations evolved independently as a derived characteristic of land plants that was not present in the ancestor common to land plants and charophyceans.

The two multicellular body forms that alternate in the life cycles of land plants are the gametophyte and sporophyte generations. The cells of the gametophyte are haploid, meaning that they have a single set of chromosomes (see Chapter 13). The gametophyte is named for its production of gametes--eggs and sperm. Fusion of eggs and sperm during the process of fertilization forms diploid zygotes. Mitotic division of the zygote produces the multicellular sporophyte. Thus, the cells of a sporophyte are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, one set contributed by each gamete. Meiosis in a mature sporophyte produces haploid reproductive cells called spores (hence the name sporophyte). A spore is a reproductive cell that can develop into a new organism without fusing with another cell (in contrast to gametes, which cannot develop directly into a multicellular organism; they must first fuse to form zygotes). Mitotic division of a plant spore produces a new multicellular gametophyte. And so the alternation of generations continues, sporophytes producing spores that develop into gametophytes, and gametophytes producing gametes that unite to form the zygotes that develop into sporophytes (FIGURE 29.6).

Fig 29-6. Alternation of generations: a generalized scheme.

Don't confuse alternation of generations with the more general occurrence of haploid and diploid stages in the life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, including animals (see FIGURE 13.4). In humans, for example, meiosis in the gonads (ovaries and testes) produces haploid gametes, which unite to form diploid zygotes. In this case, the only haploid stage in the life cycle is the gamete, which is single-celled. What distinguishes alternation of generations as a special type of haploid  diploid sexual cycle is that both stages are represented by multicellular bodies.

In some algae with alternation of generations, the multicellular sporophyte and gametophyte look alike to the unaided eye, though microscopic examination would reveal the difference in chromosome count. However, in other algal groups and all land plants, the sporophyte and gametophyte generations are very different in their morphology.

The relative size and complexity of the sporophyte and gametophyte depend on the plant group. In bryophytes, the gametophyte is the "dominant" generation--that is, the organism that is larger and more conspicuous. In contrast, the sporophyte form is the dominant generation in the life cycles of pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. For example, the fern plant most of us are familiar with--the plant with the fronds as leaves--is the diploid sporophyte. The gametophyte is a tiny plant on the forest floor.

Walled Spores Produced in Sporangia

Plant spores are haploid reproductive cells that have the potential to grow into multicellular, haploid gametophytes by mitosis (see FIGURE 29.6). A polymer called sporopollenin, the most durable organic material known, makes the walls of plant spores very tough and resistant to harsh environments (FIGURE 29.7). This chemical adaptation makes it possible for wind-carried spores to disperse through dry air without harm. All four major plant groups produce spores.

Fig 29-7. A fern spore (LM).

Multicellular organs called sporangia (singular, sporangium), found on the sporophyte generation of a plant, produce the spores (FIGURE 29.8). Within a sporangium, spore mother cells undergo meiosis and generate the haploid spores. The outer tissues of the sporangium protect developing spores until they are ready to be released into the air.

Fig 29-8. Sporangium of a hornwort (a bryophyte) sporophyte (LM).

Sporangia and resistant spores with sporopollenin-enriched walls are key terrestrial adaptations of land plants. Although the charophyceans produce spores, these algae lack multicellular sporangia, and the flagellated, water-dispersed spores lack sporopollenin.

Multicellular Gametangia

The gametophyte forms of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms all produce their gametes within multicellular organs called gametangia (FIGURE 29.9). The female gametangia are called archegonia (singular, archegonium). Each archegonium is a vase-shaped organ that produces a single egg cell and retains the egg within the base of the organ. Male gametangia, called antheridia, produce many sperm cells that are released to the environment when mature. The sperm cells of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and some gymnosperms bear flagella and swim through water droplets or water films to eggs. Eggs are fertilized within archegonia, where the zygote begins to develop into an embryo.

Other Terrestrial Adaptations Common to Many Land Plants

In addition to the characteristics we have discussed so far that distinguish the land plant clade from charophycean algae, most plants have additional terrestrial adaptations. These include adaptations for acquiring, transporting, and conserving water; adaptations for reducing the harmful effects of UV radiation, which is much more intense on land than in aquatic habitats; and adaptations for repelling terrestrial herbivores and resisting pathogens.

Adaptations for Water Conservation. The epidermis (outer cell layers) of leaves and other aerial parts of most land plants is coated with a cuticle, a layer consisting of polymers called polyesters and waxes (FIGURE 29.10). The cuticle helps protect the plant from microbial attack, and its waxy nature acts as waterproofing that helps prevent excessive water loss from the aboveground plant organs.

Fig 29-10. Cuticle of a stem from Psilotum (a pteridophyte). The yellow "glow" on the surface is caused by fluorescence of the cuticle's waxy chemicals when they are illuminated with ultraviolet light in a special type of light microscope.

The epidermis of leaves and other photosynthetic organs has pores called stomata (singular, stoma) that support photosynthesis by allowing the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the outside air and the leaf interior (see FIGURE 10.2). Stomata are also the main avenues by which water exits the leaves by evaporation. Changes in the shapes of the cells that border the stomata can close the pores to minimize water loss in hot, dry conditions.

Adaptations for Water Transport. Except for bryophytes, land plants have true roots, stems, and leaves, which are defined by the presence of vascular tissues. The two types of tissues that conduct materials in the plant's vascular system are xylem and phloem (FIGURE 29.11). Tube-shaped cells in the xylem carry water and minerals up from roots. These water-conducting cells are actually dead, with only their walls remaining to provide a system of microscopic water pipes. Phloem is a living tissue with nutrient-conducting cells arranged into tubes that distribute sugars, amino acids, and other organic products throughout the plant.

Secondary Compounds as Terrestrial Adaptations. Land plants produce many unique molecules called secondary compounds. They are so named because they are products of "secondary" metabolic pathways, side branches off the primary metabolic pathways that produce lipids, carbohydrates, and the other compounds common to all organisms.

Examples of secondary compounds in plants are alkaloids, terpenes, tannins, and phenolics such as Flavonoids. Various alkaloids, terpenes, and tannins have bitter tastes, strong odors, or toxic effects that help defend land plants against herbivorous animals. Flavonoids absorb harmful UV radiation, and some of these compounds also act as signals that function in symbiotic relationships with beneficial soil microbes (see FIGURE 37.13). Some phenolics deter attack by pathogenic microbes. Other phenolics play key structural roles in land plants. For example, the phenolic polymer called lignin hardens the cell walls of "woody" tissues in vascular plants, supporting even the tallest of trees.

Humans have found many uses, including medicinal applications, for secondary compounds extracted from plants. Just one example is the alkaloid quinine, used to help prevent malaria.

Now that we have examined many terrestrial adaptations that define land plants, let's take a closer look at how these descendants of aquatic algae colonized land.





 Land plants evolved from charophycean algae over 500 million years ago





Let's review the evidence for a phylogenetic connection between land plants and green algae, especially the charophyceans:

Homologous chloroplasts. The algal plastids most like plant chloroplasts are those of green algae and algal groups such as euglenoids, which acquired green algae as secondary endosymbionts (see FIGURE 28.25). The similarities include chlorophyll b and beta-carotene as accessory pigments and thylakoids stacked as grana. Comparisons of chloroplast DNA place the charophyceans as the green algae most closely related to land plants.

Homologous cellulose walls. Though cellulose walls are found in a diversity of algae, the walls of charophyceans are the most plantlike, with cellulose making up 20-26%  of the wall material in both plants and charophyceans. The cellulose-manufacturing rosettes found only in the plasma membranes of charophyceans and land plants are further evidence of cell wall homology.

Homologous Peroxisomes. Charophyceans are the only algae with their anti-photorespiration enzymes packaged in peroxisomes, as they are in plants.

Phragmoplasts. These assemblies occur during cell division only in plants and charophyceans.

Homologous sperm. Many plants have flagellated sperm, which match charophycean sperm closely in ultrastructure.

Molecular systematics. In addition to comparing the chloroplast DNA of charophyceans and plants, molecular systematists have also compared key nuclear genes, such as those for ribosomal RNA and cytoskeletal proteins. The results support all the other evidence connecting charophyceans and plants to a common ancestor and point especially to the most complex charophyceans, such as Chara and Coleochaete (see FIGURE 29.2) as the algae most closely related to plants. However, it is important to understand that modern Chara and Coleochaete are not the ancestors of plants.

Fossils place plants on land over 500 million years ago. The oldest known traces of land plants are encased in mid-Cambrian rocks about 550 million years old. They are microscopic fossils of what paleobotanists interpret to be plant spores. Fossilized plant spores are plentiful in mid-Ordovician (460-million-year-old) deposits from around the world, suggesting that by then plants were abundant and widespread. Some of these fossilized spores occur in aggregates of four, which is the way some modern bryophytes release their spores. The tough walls of sporopollenin explain why spores are the plant structures most likely to leave a fossil record. However, fossilized spores are sometimes associated with scraps of tissue that may represent the remains of the sporophytes that produced the spores (FIGURE 29.12).

Fig 29-12. Fossilized spores and sporophyte tissue.





 Alternation of generations in plants may have originated by delayed meiosis

The charophyceans Chara and Coleochaete are haploid organisms. There is no sporophyte generation, though these algae do retain and seem to nourish zygotes on the parental bodies, as do the gametophytes of land plants. The main difference is that the zygote of a charophycean undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores, while the zygote of a plant undergoes mitosis to produce a multicellular sporophyte, which in turn produces haploid spores by meiosis. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis for the origin of plant sporophytes is that genetic change (mutations) in an ancestral charophycean caused a delay in meiosis until one or more mitotic divisions of the zygote had occurred (FIGURE 29.13). The result would be a multicellular, diploid sporophyte. This would increase the number of cells that undergo meiosis and thus increase the number of spores produced per zygote. Some botanists speculate that such an evolutionary breakthrough was an important adaptation for maximizing the output of sexual reproduction from each zygote on land, where a shortage of water decreased the probability of swimming sperm fertilizing eggs.

Fig 29-13. A hypothetical mechanism for the origin of alternation of generations in the ancestor of plants. Meiosis in a multicellular sporophyte, rather than direct meiosis by the zygote, would increase the number of haploid offspring (gametophytes) possible from each sexual union of sperm and ovum.





 Adaptations to shallow water preadapted plants for living on land

Many species of charophycean algae inhabit shallow waters around the edges of ponds and lakes, where they are subject to occasional drying. In such environments, natural selection favors individual algae that can survive through periods when they are not completely submerged in water. A layer of sporopollenin prevents exposed charophycean zygotes from drying out until they are in water again. This chemical adaptation may have been the precursor to the tough spore walls so important to the terrestrial survival of plants. Such adaptations accumulated by at least one population of charophyceans enabled their descendants--the first plants--to live permanently above the waterline. The evolutionary novelties of these first land plants opened an expanse of terrestrial habitat previously occupied only by films of bacteria. The new frontier was spacious, the bright sunlight was unfiltered by water and algae, the atmosphere had an abundance of carbon dioxide, the soil was rich in mineral nutrients, and, at least at first, there were relatively few herbivores and pathogens. But these environmental benefits only became available with the evolution of the adaptations that enable plants to survive and reproduce on land, a very different place than the aquatic habitats of the ancestral algae.





 Plant taxonomists are reevaluating the boundaries of the plant kingdom

From our chapters on prokaryotes and protists (see Chapters 27 and 28), you are already aware that there is a revolution under way in how biologists view taxonomy as an outcome of phylogenetic analysis. That taxonomic turmoil also applies to the plant kingdom. Plant taxonomists are combining molecular systematics with cladistic analysis of the molecular data, as well as data from comparing the morphology, life cycles, and cell ultrastructure of organisms, to reevaluate the classification of plants. One international initiative, called "deep green," is focusing on the deepest phylogenetic branching within the plant kingdom to identify and name the major plant clades (monophyletic groups). For the most part, these clades correspond to the ten phyla we will survey in these chapters on plant diversity.

Even "deeper" down the phylogenetic tree of plants is the branching of the whole land plant clade from its algal relatives. Because a phylogenetic tree consists of clades nested within clades, a debate about where to draw boundaries in a hierarchical taxonomy is inevitable. In particular, which clades do we want to include in a plant kingdom?

FIGURE 29.14 contrasts three versions of the plant kingdom. The traditional one equates the plant kingdom with the clade of embryophytes, or plants with embryos--what we have been calling land plants: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. But some plant biologists now argue that the boundaries of the plant kingdom should be expanded to include the green algae most closely related to plants--the charophyceans and a few related groups. Kingdom Streptophyta is the name that has been proposed for this version of a plant kingdom. And an even broader definition of plants includes chlorophytes (the noncharophycean green algae) in a kingdom Viridiplantae (see Chapter 28). Exercising caution while the experts continue to debate, this text adopts the traditional embryophyte definition of the plant kingdom, and we'll use kingdom Plantae as the formal name for the taxon.

 The plant kingdom is monophyletic

As we begin our survey of modern plants with bryophytes in the next section, remember that the past is the key to the present. Continue to think about the problems and opportunities facing organisms that began living on land. In keeping with this theme of evolution, we will compare the life cycles of different plant phyla. It is not important for you to memorize the details of these life cycles. What is important is to view these diverse life cycles as variations of a common ancestral cycle of alternation of generations. The plant kingdom is monophyletic, meaning that it is derived from a common ancestor (see Chapter 25). Thus, we can interpret the differences we will observe in the life cycles as special reproductive adaptations of the various plant phyla as they diversified from the first plants. In the study of plants, as in the study of all life, an evolutionary perspective connects what would otherwise be an overwhelming collection of seemingly unrelated facts.





 The three phyla of bryophytes are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts





Bryophytes are represented today by three separate phyla: phylum Hepatophyta, commonly called liverworts; phylum Anthocerophyta (hornworts); and phylum Bryophyta (mosses) (FIGURE 29.15). The suffix wort is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "herb," and liverworts and hornworts are indeed small herbaceous (nonwoody) plants named for their shapes. Mosses are the most familiar bryophytes. But some organisms commonly known as "mosses" are not really mosses or even bryophytes; these include Irish moss (a red seaweed), reindeer moss (a lichen), club mosses (pteridophytes), and Spanish moss (a flowering plant).

Fig 29-15. Bryophytes.

Note that the terms Bryophyta and bryophyte are not synonymous. Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for a certain phylum, the mosses. The term bryophyte refers informally to all the nonvascular plants--the phyla Hepatophyta, Anthocerophyta, and Bryophyta. These diverse bryophytes are not a monophyletic grouping. Gene sequence data, comparative cell structure, and other evidence indicate that liverworts, hornworts, and mosses diverged independently early in plant evolution, before the origin of vascular plants (see FIGURE 29.1). And as noted earlier, fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that bryophytes were the earliest plants. Though the identity of the modern bryophyte group most similar to the earliest plants is still uncertain, liverworts and hornworts may be the most reasonable models of what early plants were like. Most plant systematists now regard mosses as the bryophyte group most closely related to vascular plants (pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms).





 The gametophyte is the dominant generation in the life cycles of bryophytes

In all three bryophyte phyla, gametophytes are the most conspicuous, dominant phase of life history; sporophytes are typically smaller and present only part of the time.

If bryophyte spores are dispersed to a favorable habitat, such as moist soil or tree bark, they may germinate and grow into gametophytes by mitosis (FIGURE 29.16, p. 586). Germinating moss spores typically produce a mass of green, branched, one-cell-thick filaments, known as a protonema, that is sometimes mistaken for algae. Protonemata (plural, meaning "first threads") have a large surface area, enhancing absorption of water and minerals. When sufficient resources are available, a protonema produces buds having tissue-producing meristems. These meristems generate the mature, gamete-producing structure, which is known as a gametophore ("gamete bearer"). Together, the protonema and gametophores make up the gametophyte body of a moss.

Fig 29-16. The life cycle of Polytrichum, a moss. The gametophyte is the prevalent generation in all bryophyte life cycles, a characteristic that contrasts with other plants.

Bryophyte gametophytes are generally only one or a few cells thick, which places all cells close to water and dissolved minerals. Most bryophytes lack conducting tissues that can distribute water and organic compounds within thick tissues. Though some bryophytes do have specialized tissues that function in water and solute conduction, cell walls in these tissues lack the lignin coating that is characteristic of vascular plant xylem. The absence of lignified vascular tissues also limits the height of bryophytes, most of which are only a few centimeters tall. Thus, most bryophytes grow close to the ground, anchored by delicate, colorless rhizoids. Rhizoids are long, tubular single cells (in liverworts and hornworts) or filaments of cells (in mosses). Rhizoids are not composed of tissues, they lack specialized conducting cells, and they do not play a primary role in water and mineral absorption. In these ways, rhizoids differ from the roots of vascular plants.

The gametophytes of hornworts and some liverworts are flattened (see FIGURE 29.15a and FIGURE 29.15b) and grow close to the ground. Moss gametophytes and those of some liverworts are described as "leafy" because they have stemlike structures that bear many leaflike appendages (see FIGURE 29.15a and FIGURE 29.15c). These are not true stems and leaves because they lack lignin-coated vascular cells. Moss "leaves" are usually only one cell thick and often lack a cuticle, features that enhance water and mineral absorption from the moist environment. However, the common "hairy cap" moss Polytrichum (FIGURE 29.15c) and its close relatives have more complex "leaves" with ridges that enhance absorption of sunlight. These leaf ridges are coated with cuticle. Polytrichum and some other mosses also possess conducting tissues in the center of their "stems," and a few mosses can grow as tall as 2 m as a result. Plant biologists are still trying to determine whether the conducting tissues of mosses are homologous with vascular plant xylem and phloem or are instead the analogous result of evolutionary convergence.

When the gametophores of bryophytes are mature, they produce gametes in gametangia. Eggs are produced singly in vase-shaped archegonia, and large numbers of sperm are produced in elongate antheridia (see FIGURE 29.16). Jackets of protective tissue enclose both types of gametangia. Bryophyte gametophytes can produce many archegonia and antheridia; in mosses these are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Flagellated sperm are released into water films in which they swim toward eggs, passing down the openings of archegonia in response to chemical attractants. Eggs are not released, but remain within the bases of archegonia. Gamete fusion results in the formation of zygotes, which are also retained by the archegonia during their development into young sporophytes. Layers of placental nutritive cells help transport materials from parent gametophyte to embryos. These nutrients help support the development of embryos into mature sporophytes.





 Bryophyte sporophytes disperse enormous numbers of spores

The cells of bryophyte sporophytes contain plastids that are usually green and photosynthetic when the sporophytes are young. Even so, bryophyte sporophytes are not capable of living apart from their maternal gametophytes. A bryophyte sporophyte remains attached to its parental gametophyte throughout the sporophyte's lifetime, dependent on the gametophyte for supplies of sugars, amino acids, minerals, and water.

Bryophytes have the smallest and simplest sporophytes of all modern plant groups, consistent with the hypothesis that sporophytes started small and simple, with larger and more complex sporophytes evolving only later in vascular plants. Among bryophytes, liverworts have the simplest sporophytes. You would need to use a magnifying glass to see their tiny bodies, which consist of a short stalk bearing a round sporangium with a protective epidermis enclosing developing spores. At the other end of the stalk, a nutritive foot is embedded in gametophyte tissues (FIGURE 29.17). Hornwort and moss sporophytes are larger and more complex. For example, hornwort sporophytes, which superficially resemble grass blades (see FIGURE 29.15b), possess a cuticle. The sporophytes of hornworts and mosses possess epidermal stomata similar to those of vascular plants.

Moss sporophytes are fairly conspicuous and familiar to most people. Though green and photosynthetic when young, moss sporophytes turn tan or brownish red when they are ready to release their spores, often remaining visible for months after spore discharge has occurred (see FIGURE 29.15c). Moss sporophytes consist of a foot, an elongated stalk known as a seta, and a spore-producing organ, the sporangium, or capsule (see FIGURE 29.16). The foot gathers sugars, amino acids, water, and minerals from the parent gametophyte via transfer cells. The seta conducts these materials to the capsule, which uses the resources to produce spores. In most mosses, the seta becomes elongated, which elevates the capsule and enhances spore dispersal.

The moss capsule (sporangium) is the site of meiosis and spore production; up to 50 million spores can be generated by one capsule. When the capsule is immature, it is covered with a protective cap of gametophyte tissue, the calyptra, but this cap is lost when the capsule is ready to release spores. The upper part of the capsule, known as a peristome, is often specialized for gradual spore discharge (FIGURE 29.18). As a result, the capsule sprinkles spores rather than dumping them out all at once. This gradual release allows mosses to take advantage of periodic wind gusts that can carry spores long distances.

Fig 29-18. A moss sporangium with a "spore-shaker" tip. At the tip of the sporangium of the moss Brachythecium, two rings of "teeth" regulate the gradual release of spores from the capsule. When conditions are moist, the two rings of teeth interlock and keep the spores inside the capsule. Drying causes the teeth to separate, allowing spores to disperse from the "shaker" you see here (SEM).





 Bryophytes provide many ecological and economic benefits

Wind dispersal of lightweight spores has distributed bryophytes around the world. These plants are particularly common and diverse in moist alpine, boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, as well as wetlands, where they form essential habitats for a variety of tiny animals. Some mosses even inhabit such extreme environments as mountaintops, arctic and antarctic tundra, and deserts; similarly harsh habitats likely challenged the earliest plants. Mosses are able to exist in very cold or dry habitats because many are able to lose most of their body water without dying, then rehydrate and reactivate their cells when moisture again becomes available. In contrast, few vascular plants can survive the same degree of desiccation. Moreover, phenolic compounds in moss cell walls absorb damaging levels of UV and other short-wavelength radiation present in deserts or at high altitudes and latitudes.

One moss genus is especially abundant and widespread. Sphagnum is a wetland moss that forms extensive deposits of undecayed organic material known as peat. Thus, Sphagnum is also called peat moss. Boggy regions dominated by this moss are known as peat bogs (FIGURE 29.19), and extensive high-latitude boreal regions occupied by Sphagnum are among the wetlands called peatlands. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the resistant phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. Sphagnum moss also secretes acidic and phenolic compounds that may reduce bacterial activity. Low temperatures and nutrient levels typical of peat bogs also inhibit microbial decay.

Fig 29-19. Sphagnum, or peat moss.

The world's peatlands store an estimated 400 billion tons of organic carbon. As carbon reservoirs, peatlands play an important role in stabilizing Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and hence climate (the role of atmospheric CO2 in climate is discussed in Chapter 54).

In the past, Sphagnum moss was widely used by aboriginal people for diapers and during wartime as a naturally antiseptic packing material for wounds. Today, Sphagnum is widely harvested for use as a soil conditioner and for packing plant roots during shipment. The usefulness of this moss is based on the presence of large, dead, water-absorbing cells, in addition to green, photosynthetic cells (see FIGURE 29.19c). This enables dry moss to absorb 20 times its weight in water. Some ecologists are concerned that overharvesting of Sphagnum will reduce its beneficial ecological effects.

Bryophytes were probably Earth's only plants for the first 100 million years that terrestrial communities existed. Then vegetation began to take on a taller profile with the evolution of vascular plants.





 Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors

Vascular plants likely inherited tissue-producing meristems, gametangia, embryos and the sporophytes that develop from them, stomata, cuticles, and sporopollenin-walled spores from mosslike ancestors. Branched, independent sporophytes probably evolved next. The evidence for this is provided by a group of Silurian fossils with the long descriptive name protracheophyte ("before vascular plants") polysporangiophytes ("plants producing many sporangia"). We'll abbreviate by just using the first part of the name.

Protracheophytes were like bryophytes in lacking lignified vascular tissue, but were different in having branched sporophytes that were not dependent on gametophytes for their growth. Branched sporophytes make more complex bodies possible and also enable individual plants to produce many more spores. And more complex forms with multiple sporangia would stand a better chance of surviving and reproducing in spite of losing some of their vegetation and sporangia to herbivores. In contrast to modern vascular plants, which have much reduced gametophytes, fossils of early species indicate life cycles with gametophytes and sporophytes that were about equal in size.





 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago

Cooksonia, named for the paleobotanist Isabel Cookson, is an extinct plant that left fossils over 408 million years old in the Silurian rocks of Europe and North America. It is the earliest-known vascular plant (FIGURE 29.20). Though its branched sporophytes stood only a few centimeters to 50 or so centimeters tall, Cooksonia had small lignified cells similar to the water-conducting cells in the xylem of modern pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). Some of Cooksonia's branches terminated in bulbous sporangia, the sporophyte organs that produce spores.

The dichotomous (forked like a Y) branching and terminal sporangia characteristic of Cooksonia are evident in the photograph of the fossil on the left. Water-conducting cells were present in true stems, but true roots and leaves were absent. The plant was anchored by a rhizome, a horizontal stem. Cooksonia grew in dense stands around marshes. The largest species was about 50 cm tall.

By Devonian times, 362-408 million years ago, a diversity of vascular plants had evolved, as revealed in the fossil record. The seven extant vascular plant phyla listed in TABLE 29.1 are their descendants, including the two modern phyla of seedless vascular plants.





 Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves





One reason plant biologists study the morphology of ferns and other seedless plants is to explore some of the terrestrial adaptations that evolved in vascular plants, including true roots and leaves.

Most pteridophytes have true roots with lignified vascular tissue. The vascular system in these roots resembles that of the stems of early vascular plants, some of which left fossils so well preserved that researchers can study their internal tissues. This suggests that pteridophyte roots probably evolved from the lowermost, subterranean portions of stems of ancient vascular plants. It is uncertain whether roots of seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) arose independently, rather than being homologous to pteridophyte roots.

Lycophytes, the modern vascular plants that diverged earliest in plant phylogeny, have small leaves with only a single unbranched vein. These leaves probably evolved from tissue flaps on the surface of stems into which a strand of vascular tissue grew. Such leaves are known as microphylls (meaning "small leaves") (FIGURE 29.22a). In contrast, leaves of other modern vascular plants are known as megaphylls because they are typically much larger (FIGURE 29.22b). Their increased size is possible because such leaves are served by a highly branched vascular system. A branched vascular system can supply an expanded leaf with water and minerals and can export sugar from the photosynthetic tissue of the larger leaves. Thus, the branched vascular systems of megaphylls support a greater photosynthetic productivity compared to microphylls.

Fig 29-22. Hypotheses for the evolution of leaves.

The study of fossils suggests that megaphylls evolved from a series of branches lying close together on a stem. Hypothetical stages in such a megaphyll origin were a flattening of the branch system and the development of tissue webbing that joined branches (see FIGURE 29.22b). According to this hypothesis, megaphylls could not have evolved in plants that lacked branched sporophytes and lignified vascular tissue. Thus, the evolution of true, branched stems likely preceded the origin of large leaves and roots (which probably evolved from the bases of stems).





 A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants

Though pteridophytes lack seeds, they provide clues to the evolution of life cycle adaptations that enhanced the reproductive success of vascular plants on land.

From Cooksonia and the other early vascular plants to all of the vascular plants that live today, the sporophyte (diploid) generation is the larger and more complex plant in the alternation of generations. For example, the leafy fern plants familiar to us are the sporophytes. You would have to get down on your hands and knees and explore with careful hands and sharp eyes to find fern gametophytes, tiny plants growing on or just below the soil surface. Until you have a chance to do that, you can study the sporophyte-dominant life cycle of seedless vascular plants in FIGURE 29.23, page 592, which uses a fern as an example. Then, for review, compare this life cycle with FIGURE 29.16, which illustrates the gametophyte-dominated life cycles of bryophytes. In Chapter 30, you will see that the gametophyte generation became even more reduced during the evolution of seed plants, and it is there that we will consider this trend as an adaptation to living on land.

Fig 29-23. The life cycle of a fern.

We can also use ferns to illustrate a key variation among vascular plants: the distinction between homosporous and heterosporous plants. The sporophyte of a homosporous plant produces a single type of spore. The fern depicted in FIGURE 29.23 is an example. Notice that each spore develops into a bisexual gametophyte having both female and male sex organs, the gametangia called archegonia and antheridia, respectively. In contrast, the sporophyte of a heterosporous plant produces two kinds of spores: Megaspores develop into female gametophytes bearing archegonia; microspores develop into male gametophytes with antheridia. Among ferns, those that returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution--the water ferns--are the only heterosporous species. However, we will see in Chapter 30 that the heterosporous condition was very important in the evolution of seeds.

The following diagrams will help you compare the homosporous and heterosporous conditions: 

The life cycle in FIGURE 29.23 illustrates one more point: The sperm cells of ferns and all other seedless vascular plants (and even some seed plants) are flagellated and must swim through a film of water to reach eggs, a characteristic shared with bryophytes. With their swimming sperm and fragile gametophytes, seedless vascular plants are most common in relatively damp habitats.





 Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants

Phylum Lycophyta (Lycophytes)

Modern lycophytes are relicts of a far more eminent past. By the Carboniferous period, there were two evolutionary lines of lycophytes--one composed of relatively small, herbaceous plants and another line of giant woody trees having diameters of more than 2 m and heights of more than 40 m. The giant lycophytes thrived for millions of years in swamps common in the warm, moist Carboniferous climate, but became extinct when the climate became cooler and drier at the end of that geologic period. The small lycophytes survived, and they are represented today by about a thousand species. Common names for some lycophytes include "club mosses" or "ground pine," though they are neither mosses nor pines (see FIGURE 29.21a).

Many species of lycophytes are tropical plants that grow on trees as epiphytes--plants that use other organisms as a substratum but are not parasites. Other lycophyte species grow close to the ground on forest floors in temperate regions, including the northern United States. Lycophyte sporophytes have upright stems bearing many small green leaves (microphylls) and horizontal stems that grow along the ground surface. Roots extend downward from the horizontal stems. Groups of specialized leaves called sporophylls, which bear sporangia, are clustered to form club-shaped cones (also known as strobili). When they are mature, the oil-rich flammable spores are released in clouds. (Early photographers ignited lycophyte spores to provide a flash of light.) After the spores disperse, they develop into inconspicuous haploid gametophytes. Depending on the species, these tiny haploid plants may be either photosynthetic plants above ground or nonphotosynthetic plants underground. The underground species may live for as long as ten years, nurtured by symbiotic fungi.

Phylum Pterophyta (Ferns and Their Relatives)

Psilophytes. Plant biologists once considered Psilotum, the whisk fern, to be a "living fossil" (see FIGURE 29.21b). The dichotomous (Y-like) branching is reminiscent of ancient vascular plants, such as the Cooksonia in FIGURE 29.20. Whisk ferns also lack true leaves and roots, which reinforced the idea that they were surviving remnants of an early lineage of vascular plants. Thus, until recently, plant biologists placed Psilotum and a closely related genus in their own phylum. However, comparisons of DNA sequences and analysis of certain ultrastructural features, such as sperm structure, has convinced most plant systematists that the psilophytes are close relatives of the plants we commonly call ferns. According to this view, the lack of true roots and leaves evolved secondarily during the divergence of the psilophytes from the fern lineage.

Sphenophytes (Horsetails). Sphenophytes are commonly called horsetails because of their often brushy appearance (see FIGURE 29.21c). As with psilophytes, the sphenophytes were once granted their own phylum; but recent molecular data suggest that they are closely related to ferns and should be classified with them. During the Carboniferous period, sphenophytes were very diverse and grew as tall as 15 m, but today there exist only about 15 species of a single, widely distributed genus, Equisetum.

Horsetails are often found in marshy places or alongside streams and sandy roadsides. They possess both upright green stems and root-bearing horizontal stems (rhizomes) that extend along the ground. The erect stems are green and jointed, with a ring of tiny leaves or branches emerging from the joints. The upright stem actually serves as the major photosynthetic organ. Internally, horsetail stems are penetrated by large air canals that allow movement of oxygen down into rhizomes and roots, which often grow in waterlogged, low-oxygen soils. This adaptation probably first arose long ago in Carboniferous swamps, but it is still useful. Reproductive horsetail stems produce cones at their tips. Equisetum's cones, like those of certain lycophytes, are composed of clusters of sporophylls--leaves bearing sporangia.

Ferns. From their Devonian beginning, ferns radiated extensively and today include more than 12,000 species. Ferns grew alongside tree lycophytes and horsetails in the great swamp forests of the Carboniferous period, but are by far the most widespread and diverse of the pteridophytes today. Ferns are most diverse in the tropics, but there are many representatives in temperate forests, and a few are able to grow in arid habitats. Ferns often have horizontal rhizomes from which grow large leaves with extensively branched vascular systems. Fern leaves are commonly known as fronds and are often compound--that is, divided into many leaflets (see FIGURE 29.21d). The fern frond grows as its coiled tip, the fiddlehead, unfurls. Tree ferns have tall erect stems bearing a crown of fronds at the top.

Ferns produce clusters of sporangia known as sori (singular, sorus) on the undersides of the green leaves or on special, nongreen leaves (sporophylls). Sori can be arranged in various patterns, such as parallel lines or dots, that are useful in fern identification (FIGURE 29.24). Most fern sporangia are equipped with springlike devices that catapult spores several meters. Once airborne, spores can be blown by the wind far from their origin. Spores, protected by sporopollenin, are the main means of dispersal for all seedless plants.

 Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period

The phyla Lycophyta and Pterophyta represent the modern lineages of seedless vascular plants that formed forests during the Carboniferous period about 290-360 million years ago (FIGURE 29.25). Seedless vascular plants of the Carboniferous forests left not only living relicts and fossils, but also fossil fuel in the form of coal.

Fig 29-25. Artist's conception of a Carboniferous forest based on fossil evidence. Most of the large trees with straight trunks are lycophytes. On the left, the tree with numerous feathery branches is a horsetail. Tree ferns, though not featured in this painting, were also abundant in the "coal forests" of the Carboniferous. Animals, including giant dragonflies like the one near the horsetail, also thrived.

Coal formed during several geologic periods, but the most extensive beds of coal are found in strata deposited during the Carboniferous, a time when most of the continents were flooded by shallow swamps. Europe and North America, located near the equator at that time, were covered by tropical swamp forests. Dead plants did not completely decay in the stagnant waters, and great depths of organic remains--peat--accumulated by a process similar to that occurring today in peat bogs. The swamps were later covered by the sea, and marine sediments piled up on top of the peat. Heat and pressure gradually converted the peat to coal, a "fossil fuel." Coal powered the Industrial Revolution, and some politicians advocate a resurgence in coal use as we continue to deplete oil and gas reserves. However, burning more coal will increase the industrial output of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" that contribute to global warming (see Chapter 55). Energy conservation and the development of alternative (nonfossil fuel) energy sources seem like prudent options instead.

Growing along with the seedless plants in Carboniferous swamps were primitive seed plants. Though seed plants were not the dominant plants at that time, they rose to prominence after the swamps began to dry up at the end of the Carboniferous period. The next chapter traces the origin and diversification of seed plants, continuing our theme of terrestrial adaptation.
