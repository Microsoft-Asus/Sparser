AMSTERDAM , Netherlands
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Major oil-producing nations pledged Friday to slash production in an effort to relieve the worldwide glut of oil that has depressed prices for months .
OPEC members , except Iraq , reached agreement with two non- OPEC exporters to reduce overall production by 2 million barrels a day .
The news sent crude oil prices to five-month highs on commodity markets , before dropping back slightly on profit-taking .
After years of seeing OPEC promise cuts only to cheat on quotas , traders are optimistic that these cuts may stick because producing countries ca n't afford to let prices fall further .
But some analysts remained wary that members of the dysfunctional OPEC family may renege on the pledge in fear of losing oil income .
`` We 'll need to see it to believe it , '' said economist Peter van Doesberg with Dutch brokerage Stroeve .
`` It 's not guaranteed that other countries will stick to the agreement .
It 's a fragile cartel . ''
OPEC members Saudi Arabia , Iran , Algeria and Venezuela , together with nonmember Mexico , thrashed out the production-cut agreement during two days of meetings in the Netherlands .
The deal must be formally approved at a March 23 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna .
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said non- OPEC members Mexico and Oman have also committed to the cuts , and discussions are under way with other non- OPEC countries .
The cuts , effective April 1 , amount to 2 million barrels a day and would be added to existing OPEC and non- OPEC cuts of 3.1 million barrels a day agreed upon last June , he said .
`` Any higher than this and I think it would have got into the range of implausible .
This is about the maximum people can stomach , '' said analyst Janelle Matharoo of Bankers Trust in London .
Algerian Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi , who is also OPEC president , said a more precise figure and a breakdown of the cuts would be given at the March 23 meeting .
Kate Warne , an analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones in St. Louis , said OPEC members are still exceeding their self-imposed production quotas by 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day .
So if there is no cheating on this agreement , it would make headway in reducing the glut , she said .
Oil prices have been rising in recent days as traders grew optimistic that some cutbacks would be announced before the OPEC meeting .
Friday 's announcement pushed up contracts for April delivery of light , sweet crude 18 cents to close at $ 14.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , after hitting an intraday high of $ 15.11 -- the highest since early October .
The rally has pushed oil prices up 35 percent from December 's 12-year lows .
In London , North Sea Brent Blend crude oil rose 42 cents to $ 12.60 per barrel at the International Petroleum Exchange , after hitting an intraday high of $ 13.19 .
Brent crude last settled above $ 13 per barrel in November Analysts estimated that crude prices could rise to $ 16 to $ 20 per barrel by year 's end if oil producers adhere to the cutbacks .
James Van Alen , an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia , said the market is more willing to believe that the cuts will stick because producers have been suffering so long from depressed prices .
`` What you 're seeing is that they 're a little more scared , '' Van Alen said .
Also raising optimism was a pledge last month by the president of Venezuela -- seen as one of the largest overproducers -- to comply with the previously announced cutbacks .
One of the major obstacles to a new agreement had been the issue of Iran 's production .
Iran has insisted that any cuts be made from a base production level of 3.925 million barrels a day , while other oil producers claim that figure should actually be 3.623 million barrels a day .
The oil ministers declined comment Friday on the issue , but consultations between Saudi Arabia and Iran and also between Gulf Cooperation Council members appear to have broken the stalemate .
OPEC members are Algeria , Indonesia , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela .
