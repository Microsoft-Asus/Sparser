The new poll found that 45 percent of surveyed Venezuelans planned to vote for Chavez in the Dec. 6 presidential election , up from 42 percent .
Meanwhile , 39 percent planned to vote for Salas , up from 31 percent .

___ SANTO DOMINGO , Dominican Republic -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Former president Joaquin Balaguer , 92 , is among more than 100 witnesses called to testify at the trial of six former military officers accused of a 1975 political assassination .
The defendants are accused of killing journalist Orlando Martinez , a strong critic of then-president Balaguer and the military leadership , accusing them of frequent human rights violations .
The investigation languished for years until 1997 , when current President Leonel Fernandez ordered prosecutors to bring the case to trial .
The trial is expected to begin Thursday .
Balaguer , who was president for 22 years over three decades , wrote a book in which he left one page blank .
That page was left for what he called the true story about Martinez 's death and would be revealed after Balaguer died .
Balaguer , infirm , and legally blind , was re-elected to a four-year term in 1994 , but left office in 1996 under international pressure because of widespread evidence of fraud in his election victory .
