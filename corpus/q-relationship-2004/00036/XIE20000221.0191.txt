All members of the UN should adhere to the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and related UN resolutions , abide by norms governing international relations , including mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and never , in any form , support Taiwan 's joining the UN or other international organizations whose membership is confined to sovereign states .
On the basis of the principle of one China , the Chinese government has made arrangements for Taiwan 's participation in some inter-governmental international organizations which accept region membership in an agreeable and acceptable way according to the nature , regulations and actual conditions of these international organizations .
As a region of China , Taiwan has participated in the Asian Development Bank -LRB- ADB -RRB- and the Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- respectively in the names of '' Taipei , China '' and `` Chinese Taipei . ''
In September 1992 , the chairman of the council of the predecessor of the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- , stated that Taiwan may participate in this organization as `` a separate Taiwan - Penghu - Jinmen - Mazu tariff zone '' -LRB- abbreviated as Chinese Taipei -RRB- after the PRC 's entry to GATT .
The WTO should persist in the principle defined in the afore-said statement when examining the acceptance of Taiwan 's entry to the organization .
This is only an ad hoc arrangement and cannot constitute a model applicable to other inter-governmental international organizations or international gatherings .
