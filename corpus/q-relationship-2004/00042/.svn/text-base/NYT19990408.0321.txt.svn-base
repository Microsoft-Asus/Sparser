WASHINGTON --
President Clinton and China 's Prime Minister , Zhu Rongji , fell short Thursday of reaching a major trade deal that China has long sought , even though the two leaders said they made tremendous progress in negotiations to usher China into the organization that sets the rules for global commerce .
Although the announcement by Clinton that `` we are not quite there yet '' came well short of the hopes both leaders had harbored for China 's entrance into the World Trade Organization , it had the virtue of giving Clinton and Zhu more time to prepare their constituencies at home for an agreement that faces fierce opposition in both capitals .
At a 90-minute news conference Thursday , the blunt-talking Chinese prime minister blamed what he termed an `` anti- Chinese '' mood in Washington , saying , `` If you want to hear some honest words , then I should say that now the problem does not lie with this big difference , or big gap '' in negotiating positions , `` but lies with the political atmosphere . ''
If it were not for that , he said , China and the United States would be ready to sign `` a full-package agreement . ''
Both business executives and China experts expressed surprise at the scope of some of Beijing 's concessions -- some of which may have as much political resonance as economic impact .
For the first time , for example , China agreed to permit American telecommunications companies to control Chinese cellular telephone firms and Internet companies , and operate throughout the vast country of 1.2 billion people .
How China would square that with its efforts to quash political opposition and limit Internet access was unclear .
Among the issues left outstanding , though , were some that directly affect two of President Clinton 's most high-profile constituencies : Wall Street and Hollywood .
China has refused to let American brokerages into its free-for-all stock markets , and it wants to restrict the number of American movies that can be released in its theaters , arguing that it must limit what one Chinese official recently called `` cultural pollution . ''
The days of furious negotiations were overshadowed Thursday afternoon , however , as Zhu used the news conference to take on China 's critics with a vehemence and a directness that no Chinese leader has ever shown on American soil .
He invoked Abraham Lincoln 's use of force to keep the Union together as an example China should keep in mind as it deals with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a breakaway province -- a comparison Clinton stepped in to reject .
He derided reports that China stole nuclear weapons secrets , and mocked allegations that China sought to influence the 1996 Presidential election .
`` I have $ 146 billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves , '' said the man who has overseen China 's profound economic transition in recent years , `` so I should have put out at least $ 10 billion for that purpose . ''
`` Why just $ 300,000 ? '' he asked , referring to the amount of campaign contributions investigators say originated from Chinese military intelligence .
`` That would be too foolish ! '' he said , as the audience laughed and Clinton cracked a smile .
And even in human rights , the perpetual area of dispute , Zhu first attacked the American decision to win an international condemnation of its political crackdown , and then tried disarming his critics by partially agreeing with them .
`` I am more impatient that you are '' to change China 's human rights environment , he said , suggesting that his country was still struggling under the hangover of thousands of years of a feudal system .
Thursday 's meetings came amid a clear effort by Clinton to embrace Zhou as the kind of Chinese reformer he can deal with -- an embrace similar to the one Washington extended a decade ago to the Soviet Union 's Mikhail Gorbachev .
Although he is a clear No. 2 to President Jiang Zemin , who came here a year ago , the 70-year -old Zhu received most of the trappings of a state visit .
On Washington 's first warm spring day , the economic reformer who talks openly about dismantling Mao 's system of state-owned industries was given a 19-gun salute , full military honors and a welcome from President Clinton that included thanks for China 's willingness 200 years ago to give `` our newly independent nation equal standing with the powers of Europe . ''
He was clearly suggesting that the United States , by guiding China into the WTO , intended to return the favor .
Thursday night , Clinton hosted a glittering official dinner and invited business executives and academics with ties to China , with a performance by Yo - Yo Ma , one of the world 's premier cellists .
Zhu seemed relieved by the welcome .
Asked Thursday why he came to the United States at this difficult moment in the two countries ' relations , he said : `` Are you asking me to tell you the truth ?
To tell you the truth , I was really reluctant to come , '' adding that he had asked a delegation of American congressmen and senators in Beijing last week `` Will my ` new face ' be turned into a bloody face ? ''
But he came to Washington as Congress was out of session , meaning that he did not have to confront China 's critics on the Democratic left and the Republican right , who appear to be joining forces in opposing China 's entry to the WTO .
In fact , Clinton 's aides acknowledged Thursday that any trade deal with China would become enmeshed in the debates about nuclear spying , stepped-up political repression and a soaring trade deficit .
`` Getting this through the Hill is going to be a killer , '' a senior administration official said .
