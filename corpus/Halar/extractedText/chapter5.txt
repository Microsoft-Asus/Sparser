We have applied the concept of emergent properties to our study of water and relatively simple organic molecules. These substances are central to life, each one having unique behavior arising from the orderly arrangement of its atoms. Another level in the hierarchy of biological organization is reached when cells join small organic molecules together to form larger molecules. The four main classes of large biological molecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Many of these cellular molecules are, on the molecular scale, huge. For example, a protein may consist of thousands of covalently connected atoms that form a molecular colossus weighing over 100,000 daltons. Biologists use the term macromolecule for such giant molecules.

Considering the size and complexity of macromolecules, it is remarkable that biochemists have determined the detailed structures of so many of them (FIGURE 5.1). The architecture of a macromolecule helps explain how that molecule works. For example, the pleated structure of the silk protein from which the orb spider in the photo on this page weaves its web gives the fibers their strength and springiness. Proteins and the other large molecules of life are the main subject of this chapter. For these molecules, as at all levels in the biological hierarchy, form and function are inseparable.

In the 1950s, Pauling discovered several of the basic structural features of proteins, which he demonstrated by building physical models.

POLYMER PRINCIPLES

 

 Most macromolecules are polymers



 

 An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers



In examining the relationship between the structure and function of life's macromolecules, we begin with a key generalization about how cells build these large molecules from smaller ones.





CARBOHYDRATES--FUEL AND BUILDING MATERIAL

 

 Sugars, the smallest carbohydrates, serve as fuel and carbon sources



 

 Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles



Carbohydrates include both sugars and their polymers. The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, or single sugars, also known as simple sugars. Disaccharides are double sugars, consisting of two monosaccharides joined by condensation. The carbohydrates that are macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers of many sugars.





LIPIDS--DIVERSE HYDROPHOBIC MOLECULES

 

 Fats store large amounts of energy



 

 Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes



 

 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones



Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that does not include polymers. The compounds called lipids are grouped together because they share one important trait: They have little or no affinity for water. The hydrophobic behavior of lipids is based on their molecular structure. Although they may have some polar bonds associated with oxygen, lipids consist mostly of hydrocarbons. Smaller than true (polymeric) macromolecules, lipids are a highly varied group in both form and function. Lipids include waxes and certain pigments, but we will focus on the most important families of lipids: the fats, phospholipids, and steroids.





PROTEINS--MANY STRUCTURES, MANY FUNCTIONS

 

 A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids connected in a specific sequence



 

 A protein's function depends on its specific conformation



The importance of proteins is implied by their name, which comes from the Greek word proteios, meaning "first place." Proteins account for more than 50%  of the dry weight of most cells, and they are instrumental in almost everything organisms do (TABLE 5.1, p. 72). Proteins are used for structural support, storage, transport of other substances, signaling from one part of the organism to another, movement, and defense against foreign substances. In addition, as enzymes, proteins regulate metabolism by selectively accelerating chemical reactions in the cell. A human has tens of thousands of different proteins, each with a specific structure and function.

Other proteins are responsible for the undulations of the organelles called cilia and flagella.Defensive proteinsProtection against diseaseAntibodies combat bacteria and viruses.Enzymatic proteinsSelective acceleration of chemical reactionsDigestive enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the polymers in food.Proteins are the most structurally sophisticated molecules known. Consistent with their diverse functions, they vary extensively in structure, each type of protein having a unique three-dimensional shape, or conformation. Diverse though proteins may be, they are all polymers constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids. Polymers of amino acids are called polypeptides. A protein consists of one or more polypeptides folded and coiled into specific conformations.





NUCLEIC ACIDS--INFORMATIONAL POLYMERS

 

 Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information



 

 A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides



 

 Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix



 

 We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution



If the primary structure of polypeptides determines the conformation of a protein, what determines primary structure? The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a unit of inheritance known as a gene. Genes consist of DNA, which is a polymer belonging to the class of compounds known as nucleic acids.





 Most macromolecules are polymers

The large molecules in three of the four classes of life's organic compounds--carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids--are chainlike molecules called polymers (from the Greek polys, many, and meris, part). A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by covalent bonds, much as a train consists of a chain of cars. The repeating units that serve as the building blocks of a polymer are small molecules called monomers. Some of the molecules that serve as monomers also have other functions of their own.

The classes of polymeric macromolecules differ in the nature of their monomers, but the chemical mechanisms that cells use to make and break polymers are basically the same in all cases (FIGURE 5.2). Monomers are connected by a reaction in which two molecules are covalently bonded to each other through loss of a water molecule; this is called a condensation reaction, specifically a dehydration reaction, because the molecule lost is water (FIGURE 5.2a). When a bond forms between two monomers, each monomer contributes part of the water molecule that is lost: One molecule provides a hydroxyl group (--OH), while the other provides a hydrogen (--H). To make a polymer, this reaction is repeated as monomers are added to the chain one by one. The cell must expend energy to carry out these dehydration reactions, and the process occurs only with the help of enzymes, specialized proteins that speed up chemical reactions in cells.

Fig 5-2. The synthesis and breakdown of polymers.

Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis, a process that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction (FIGURE 5.2b). Hydrolysis means to break with water (from the Greek hydro, water, and lysis, break). Bonds between monomers are broken by the addition of water molecules, a hydrogen from the water attaching to one monomer and a hydroxyl attaching to the adjacent monomer. An example of hydrolysis working in our bodies is the process of digestion. The bulk of the organic material in our food is in the form of polymers that are much too large to enter our cells. Within the digestive tract, various enzymes attack the polymers, speeding up hydrolysis. The released monomers are then absorbed into the bloodstream for distribution to all body cells. Those cells can then use dehydration reactions to assemble the monomers into new polymers that differ from the ones that were digested.





 An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers

Each cell has thousands of different kinds of macromolecules; the collection varies from one type of cell to another in the same organism. The inherent differences between human siblings reflect variations in polymers, particularly DNA and proteins. Molecular differences between unrelated individuals are more extensive--and between species greater still. The diversity of macromolecules in the living world is vast, and the potential variety is effectively limitless.

What is the basis for such diversity in life's polymers? These molecules are constructed from only 40 to 50 common monomers and some others that occur rarely. Building an enormous variety of polymers from such a limited list of monomers is analogous to constructing hundreds of thousands of words from only 26 letters of the alphabet. The key is arrangement--variation in the linear sequence the units follow. However, this analogy falls far short of describing the great diversity of macromolecules, because most biological polymers are much longer than the longest word. Proteins, for example, are built from 20 kinds of amino acids arranged in chains that are typically hundreds of amino acids long. The molecular logic of life is simple but elegant: Small molecules common to all organisms are ordered into unique macromolecules.

We are now ready to investigate the specific structures and functions of the four major classes of organic compounds found in cells. For each class, we will see that the large molecules have emergent properties not found in their individual building blocks.





 Sugars, the smallest carbohydrates, serve as fuel and carbon sources

Monosaccharides (from the Greek monos, single, and sacchar, sugar) generally have molecular formulas that are some multiple of CH2O (FIGURE 5.3). Glucose (C6H12O6), the most common monosaccharide, is of central importance in the chemistry of life. In the structure of glucose, we can see the trademarks of a sugar: The molecule has a carbonyl group () and multiple hydroxyl groups. Depending on the location of the carbonyl group, a sugar is either an aldose (aldehyde sugar) or a ketose (ketone sugar). Glucose, for example, is an aldose; fructose, a structural isomer of glucose, is a ketose. (Most names for sugars end in -ose.) Another criterion for classifying sugars is the size of the carbon skeleton, which ranges from three to seven carbons long. Glucose, fructose, and other sugars that have six carbons are called hexoses. Trioses (three-carbon sugars) and pentoses (five-carbon sugars) are also common.

Still another source of diversity for simple sugars is in the spatial arrangement of their parts around asymmetric carbons. (Recall from Chapter 4 that an asymmetric carbon is one attached to four different kinds of covalent partners.) Glucose and galactose, for example, differ only in the placement of parts around one asymmetric carbon (see the gray boxes in FIGURE 5.3). What may seem at first a small difference is significant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes and behaviors.

Although it is convenient to draw glucose with a linear carbon skeleton, this representation is not accurate. In aqueous solutions, glucose molecules, as well as most other sugars, form rings (FIGURE 5.4).

Fig 5-4. Linear and ring forms of glucose.

Monosaccharides, particularly glucose, are major nutrients for cells. In the process known as cellular respiration, cells extract the energy stored in glucose molecules. Not only are simple sugar molecules a major fuel for cellular work, but their carbon skeletons serve as raw material for the synthesis of other types of small organic molecules, such as amino acids and fatty acids. Sugar molecules that are not immediately used in these ways are generally incorporated as monomers into disaccharides or polysaccharides.

A disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage, a covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction. For example, maltose is a disaccharide formed by the linking of two molecules of glucose (FIGURE 5.5a). Also known as malt sugar, maltose is an ingredient for brewing beer. The most prevalent disaccharide is sucrose, which is table sugar. Its two monomers are glucose and fructose (FIGURE 5.5b). Plants generally transport carbohydrates from leaves to roots and other nonphotosynthetic organs in the form of sucrose. Lactose, the sugar present in milk, is another disaccharide, consisting of a glucose molecule joined to a galactose molecule.

Fig 5-5. Examples of disaccharide synthesis.





 Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles

Polysaccharides are macromolecules, polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages. Some polysaccharides serve as storage material, hydrolyzed as needed to provide sugar for cells. Other polysaccharides serve as building material for structures that protect the cell or the whole organism. The architecture and function of a polysaccharide are determined by its sugar monomers and by the positions of its glycosidic linkages.

Storage Polysaccharides

Starch, a storage polysaccharide of plants, is a polymer consisting entirely of glucose monomers (FIGURE 5.6a). Most of these monomers are joined by 1-4 linkages (number 1 carbon to number 4 carbon), like the glucose units in maltose (see FIGURE 5.5a). The angle of these bonds makes the polymer helical. The simplest form of starch, amylose, is unbranched. Amylopectin, a more complex form of starch, is a branched polymer with 1-6 linkages at the branch points.

Fig 5-6. Storage polysaccharides. These examples, starch and glycogen, are composed entirely of glucose monomers, abbreviated here as hexagons. The polymer chains tend to spiral to form helices.

Plants store starch as granules within cellular structures called plastids, including chloroplasts (see FIGURE 5.6a). By synthesizing starch, the plant can stockpile surplus glucose. Because glucose is a major cellular fuel, starch represents stored energy. The sugar can later be withdrawn from this carbohydrate bank by hydrolysis, which breaks the bonds between the glucose monomers. Most animals, including humans, also have enzymes that can hydrolyze plant starch, making glucose available as a nutrient for cells. Potato tubers and grains--the fruits of wheat, corn, rice, and other grasses--are the major sources of starch in the human diet.

Animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen, a polymer of glucose that is like amylopectin but more extensively branched (see FIGURE 5.6b). Humans and other vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells. Hydrolysis of glycogen in these cells releases glucose when the demand for sugar increases. This stored fuel cannot sustain an animal for long, however. In humans, for example, the glycogen bank is depleted in about a day unless it is replenished by consumption of food.

Structural Polysaccharides

Organisms build strong materials from structural polysaccharides. For example, the polysaccharide called cellulose is a major component of the tough walls that enclose plant cells. On a global scale, plants produce almost 1011 (100 billion) tons of cellulose per year; it is the most abundant organic compound on Earth. Like starch, cellulose is a polymer of glucose, but the glycosidic linkages in these two polymers differ. The difference is based on the fact that there are actually two slightly different ring structures for glucose (FIGURE 5.7a). When glucose forms a ring, the hydroxyl group attached to the number 1 carbon is locked into one of two alternative positions: either below or above the plane of the ring. These two ring forms for glucose are called alpha (a) and beta (b), respectively. In starch, all the glucose monomers are in the a configuration (FIGURE 5.7b), the arrangement we saw in FIGURES 5.4 and 5.5. In contrast, the glucose monomers of cellulose are all in the b configuration, making every other glucose monomer upside down with respect to the others (FIGURE 5.7c).

Fig 5-7. Starch and cellulose structures.

The differing glycosidic links in starch and cellulose give the two molecules distinct three-dimensional shapes. Whereas a starch molecule is mostly helical, a cellulose molecule is straight (and never branched), and its hydroxyl groups are free to hydrogen-bond with the hydroxyls of other cellulose molecules lying parallel to it. In plant cell walls, parallel cellulose molecules held together in this way are grouped into units called microfibrils (FIGURE 5.8, p. 68). These cables are a strong building material for plants--as well as for humans, who use wood, which is rich in cellulose, for lumber.

Fig 5-8. The arrangement of cellulose in plant cell walls.

Enzymes that digest starch by hydrolyzing its a linkages are unable to hydrolyze the b linkages of cellulose. In fact, few organisms possess enzymes that can digest cellulose. Humans do not; the cellulose fibrils in our food pass through the digestive tract and are eliminated with the feces. Along the way, the fibrils abrade the wall of the digestive tract and stimulate the lining to secrete mucus, which aids in the smooth passage of food through the tract. Thus, although cellulose is not a nutrient for humans, it is an important part of a healthful diet. Most fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains are rich in cellulose. On food packages, "insoluble fiber" refers mainly to cellulose.

Some microbes can digest cellulose, breaking it down to glucose monomers. A cow harbors cellulose-digesting bacteria in the rumen, the first compartment in its stomach. The bacteria hydrolyze the cellulose of hay and grass and convert the glucose to other nutrients that nourish the cow. Similarly, a termite, which is unable to digest cellulose for itself, has microbes living in its gut that can make a meal of wood. Some fungi can also digest cellulose, thereby helping recycle chemical elements within Earth's ecosystems.

Another important structural polysaccharide is chitin, the carbohydrate used by arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans, and related animals) to build their exoskeletons (FIGURE 5.9). An exoskeleton is a hard case that surrounds the soft parts of an animal. Pure chitin is leathery, but it becomes hardened when encrusted with calcium carbonate, a salt. Chitin is also found in many fungi, which use this polysaccharide rather than cellulose as the building material for their cell walls. Chitin is similar to cellulose, except that the glucose monomer of chitin has a nitrogen-containing appendage:

 Fats store large amounts of energy

Although fats are not polymers, they are large molecules, and they are assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions. A fat is constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids (FIGURE 5.10). Glycerol is an alcohol with three carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl group. A fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. At one end of the fatty acid is a carboxyl group, the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acids. Attached to the carboxyl group is a long hydrocarbon chain. The nonpolar C--H bonds in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are the reason fats are hydrophobic. Fats separate from water because the water molecules hydrogen-bond to one another and exclude the fats. A common example of this phenomenon is the separation of vegetable oil (a liquid fat) from the aqueous vinegar solution in a bottle of salad dressing.

Fig 5-10. The synthesis and structure of a fat, or triacylglycerol. The molecular building blocks of a fat are one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. (a) One water molecule is removed for each fatty acid joined to the glycerol. (b) The result is a fat. Although the fat shown here has three identical fatty acid units, other fats have two or even three different kinds of fatty acids. The carbons of the fatty acid chains are arranged zig-zag to suggest the actual orientations of the four single bonds extending from each carbon (see FIGURE 4.2).

In making a fat, three fatty acids each join to glycerol by an ester linkage, a bond between a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. The resulting fat, also called a triacylglycerol, thus consists of three fatty acids ("tails") linked to one glycerol molecule (the "head"). (Still another name for a fat is triglyceride, a word often found in the list of ingredients on packaged foods.) The fatty acids in a fat can be the same, as in FIGURE 5.10b, or they can be of two or three different kinds.

Fatty acids vary in length and in the number and locations of double bonds. The terms saturated fats and unsaturated fats are commonly used in the context of nutrition (FIGURE 5.11). These terms refer to the structure of the hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids. If there are no double bonds between the carbon atoms composing the chain, then as many hydrogen atoms as possible are bonded to the carbon skeleton. Such a structure is described as being saturated with hydrogen, so the resulting fatty acid is called a saturated fatty acid (see FIGURE 5.11a). An unsaturated fatty acid has one or more double bonds, formed by the removal of hydrogen atoms from the carbon skeleton. The fatty acid will have a kink in its tail wherever a double bond occurs (FIGURE 5.11b).

Fig 5-11. Examples of saturated and unsaturated fats and fatty acids.

A fat made from saturated fatty acids is called a saturated fat. Most animal fats are saturated: The "tails" of their fatty acids lack double bonds. Saturated animal fats--such as lard and butter--are solid at room temperature. In contrast, the fats of plants and fishes are generally unsaturated, meaning that they are built of one or more types of unsaturated fatty acids. Usually liquid at room temperature, plant and fish fats are referred to as oils--for instance, corn oil and cod liver oil. The kinks where the double bonds are located prevent the molecules from packing together closely enough to solidify at room temperature. The phrase "hydrogenated vegetable oils" on food labels means that unsaturated fats have been synthetically converted to saturated fats by adding hydrogen. Peanut butter, margarine, and many other products are hydrogenated to prevent lipids from separating out in liquid (oil) form.

A diet rich in saturated fats is one of several factors that may contribute to the cardiovascular disease known as atherosclerosis. In this condition, deposits called plaques develop on the internal lining of blood vessels, impeding blood flow and reducing the resilience of the vessels.

Fat has come to have such a negative connotation in our culture that you might wonder whether fats serve any useful purpose. The major function of fats is energy storage. The hydrocarbon chains of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and are just as rich in energy. A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide, such as starch. Because plants are relatively immobile, they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch. (Vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds, where more compact storage is an asset to the plant.) Animals, on the other hand, must carry their energy stores with them, so there is an advantage to having a more compact reservoir of fuel--fat. Humans and other mammals stock their long-term food reserves in adipose cells (see FIGURE 4.5), which swell and shrink as fat is deposited and withdrawn from storage. In addition to storing energy, adipose tissue also cushions such vital organs as the kidneys, and a layer of fat beneath the skin insulates the body. This subcutaneous layer is especially thick in whales, seals, and most other marine mammals.





 Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes

Phospholipids are similar to fats, but they have only two fatty acid tails rather than three. The third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group, which is negative in electrical charge. Additional small molecules, usually charged or polar, can be linked to the phosphate group to form a variety of phospholipids (FIGURE 5.12).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 5-12. The structure of a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a hydrophilic (polar) head and two hydrophobic tails. Phospholipid diversity is based on differences in the two fatty acid tails and in the groups attached to the phosphate group of the head. This particular phospholipid, called a phosphatidylcholine, has an attached choline group. The kink in one of its tails is due to a double bond. (a) The structural formula follows a common chemical convention of omitting the carbons and attached hydrogens of the hydrocarbon tails. (b) In the space-filling model, black = carbon, gray = hydrogen, red = oxygen, yellow = phosphorus, and blue = nitrogen. (c) This symbol for a phospholipid will appear throughout the book.

Phospholipids show ambivalent behavior toward water. Their tails, which consist of hydrocarbons, are hydrophobic and are excluded from water. However, the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water.

When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into aggregates that shield their hydrophobic portions from water. One kind of cluster is a micelle, a phospholipid droplet with the phosphate heads on the outside, in contact with water. The hydrocarbon tails are restricted to the water-free interior of the micelle (FIGURE 5.13a).

The hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from water. (a) A micelle, in cross section. (b) A cross section of a phospholipid bilayer between two aqueous compartments. Such bilayers are the main fabric of biological membranes.

At the surface of a cell, phospholipids are arranged in a bilayer, or double layer (FIGURE 5.13b). The hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer, in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside the cell. The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the membrane, away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, phospholipids are major components of cell membranes. This behavior provides another example of how form fits function at the molecular level.





 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones

Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings (FIGURE 5.14). Different steroids vary in the functional groups attached to this ensemble of rings. One steroid, cholesterol, is a common component of animal cell membranes and is also the precursor from which other steroids are synthesized. Many hormones, including vertebrate sex hormones, are steroids produced from cholesterol (see FIGURE 4.8). Thus, cholesterol is a crucial molecule in animals, although a high level of it in the blood may contribute to atherosclerosis.

 A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids connected in a specific sequence

As mentioned in Chapter 4, amino acids are organic molecules possessing both carboxyl and amino groups. The figure at the right shows the general formula for an amino acid. At the center of the amino acid is an asymmetric carbon atom called the alpha (a) carbon. Its four different partners are an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group symbolized by R. The R group, also called the side chain, differs with the amino acid. FIGURE 5.15 shows the 20 amino acids that cells use to build their thousands of proteins. Here the amino and carboxyl groups are all depicted in ionized form, as they usually exist at the neutral pH inside a cell. The R group may be as simple as a hydrogen atom, as in the amino acid glycine (the one amino acid lacking an asymmetric carbon, since two of its a carbon's partners are hydrogen atoms), or it may be a carbon skeleton with various functional groups attached, as in glutamine. (Organisms have some other amino acids, not shown in FIGURE 5.15, but these are not incorporated into proteins.)

Fig 5-15. The 20 amino acids of proteins. The amino acids are grouped here according to the properties of their side chains (R groups), highlighted in white. (One group is shown above; the other groups are on page 73.) The amino acids are shown in their prevailing ionic forms at pH 7, the approximate pH within a cell. In parentheses are the three-letter abbreviations for the amino acids. All the amino acids used in proteins are the same enantiomer, called the L form (see FIGURE 4.6).

The physical and chemical properties of the side chain determine the unique characteristics of a particular amino acid. In FIGURE 5.15, the amino acids are grouped according to the properties of their side chains. One group consists of amino acids with nonpolar side chains, which are hydrophobic. Another group consists of amino acids with polar side chains, which are hydrophilic. Acidic amino acids are those with side chains that are generally negative in charge owing to the presence of a carboxyl group, which is usually dissociated (ionized) at cellular pH. Basic amino acids have amino groups in their side chains that are generally positive in charge. (Notice that all amino acids have carboxyl groups and amino groups; the terms acidic and basic in this context refer only to the side chains.) Because they are charged, acidic and basic side chains are also hydrophilic.

Now that we have examined amino acids, let's see how they are linked to form polymers (FIGURE 5.16). When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other, an enzyme can cause them to join by catalyzing a dehydration reaction. The resulting covalent bond is called a peptide bond. Repeated over and over, this process yields a polypeptide, a polymer of many amino acids linked by peptide bonds (FIGURE 5.16). At one end of the polypeptide chain is a free amino group, and at the opposite end is a free carboxyl group. Thus, the chain has an amino end (N-terminus) and a carboxyl end (C-terminus). The repeating sequence of atoms highlighted in purple in FIGURE 5.16b is called the polypeptide backbone. Attached to this backbone are different kinds of appendages, the side chains of the amino acids. Polypeptides range in length from a few monomers to a thousand or more. Each specific polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids. The immense variety of polypeptides in nature illustrates an important concept introduced earlier--that cells can make many different polymers by linking a limited set of monomers into diverse sequences.

(b) The peptide bonds are formed one at a time, starting with the amino acid at the amino end (N-terminus). The polypeptide has a repetitive backbone (purple) to which the amino acid side chains are attached.





 A protein's function depends on its specific conformation

The term polypeptide is not quite synonymous with protein. The relationship is somewhat analogous to that between a long strand of yarn and a sweater of particular size and shape that one can knit from the yarn. A functional protein is not just a polypeptide chain, but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape (FIGURE 5.17). It is the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide that determines what three-dimensional conformation the protein will take. Many proteins are globular (roughly spherical), while others are fibrous in shape. However, within these broad categories, countless variations are possible.

Fig 5-17. Conformation of a protein, the enzyme lysozyme. Present in our sweat, tears, and saliva, lysozyme is an enzyme that helps prevent infection by binding to and destroying specific molecules on the surface of many kinds of bacteria. The groove is the part of the protein that recognizes and binds to the target molecules on bacterial walls. (In the ribbon model, the yellow lines represent one type of chemical bond that stabilizes the protein's shape.)

A protein's specific conformation determines how it works. In almost every case, the function of a protein depends on its ability to recognize and bind to some other molecule. For instance, an antibody binds to a particular foreign substance that has invaded the body, and an enzyme recognizes and binds to its substrate, the substance the enzyme works on. In Chapter 2, you learned that one nerve cell in the brain signals another by dispatching specific molecules that have a unique shape. The receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell are proteins that fit the signal molecules something like a lock and key (see FIGURE 2.18).

Four Levels of Protein Structure

When a cell synthesizes a polypeptide, the chain generally folds spontaneously to assume the functional conformation for that protein. This folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of a variety of bonds between parts of the chain. Thus, the function of a protein--the ability of a receptor protein to identify and associate with a particular chemical messenger, for instance--is an emergent property resulting from exquisite molecular order. In the complex architecture of a protein, we can recognize three superimposed levels of structure, known as primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. A fourth level, quaternary structure, arises when a protein consists of two or more polypeptide chains.

Primary Structure. The primary structure of a protein is its unique sequence of amino acids. As an example, we will examine the primary structure of lysozyme, the antibacterial enzyme illustrated in its three-dimensional form in FIGURE 5.17. Lysozyme is a relatively small protein, its single polypeptide chain only 129 amino acids long. In FIGURE 5.18, the polypeptide chain is unraveled for a closer look at its primary structure. A specific one of the 20 amino acids occupies each of the 129 positions along the chain. The primary structure is like the order of letters in a very long word. If left to chance, there would be 20129 different ways of arranging amino acids into a polypeptide chain of this length. However, the precise primary structure of a protein is determined not by the random linking of amino acids, but by inherited genetic information.

The names of the amino acids are given as their three-letter abbreviations. The chain was drawn in this serpentine fashion to make the entire sequence readily visible. The actual shape of lysozyme is shown in FIGURE 5.17.

Even a slight change in primary structure can affect a protein's conformation and ability to function. For instance, the substitution of one amino acid for another at a particular position in the primary structure of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells, causes sickle-cell disease, an inherited blood disorder. Normal red blood cells are disk-shaped, but in sickle-cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to crystallize, deforming some of the cells into a sickle shape (FIGURE 5.19). The life of someone with the disease is punctuated by "sickle-cell crises," which occur when the angular cells clog tiny blood vessels, impeding blood flow.

The pioneer in determining the primary structure of proteins was Frederick Sanger, who, with his colleagues at Cambridge University in England, worked out the amino acid sequence of the hormone insulin in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His approach was to use protein-digesting enzymes and other catalysts that break polypeptides at specific places rather than completely hydrolyzing the chains. Treatment with one of these agents cleaves a polypeptide into fragments that can be separated by a technique called chromatography. Hydrolysis with another agent breaks the polypeptide at different sites, yielding a second group of fragments. Sanger used chemical methods to determine the sequence of amino acids in these small fragments. Then he searched for overlapping regions among the pieces obtained by hydrolyzing with the different agents. Consider, for instance, two fragments with the following sequences:
We can deduce from the overlapping regions that the intact polypeptide contains in its primary structure the following segment:

Just as we could reconstruct this sentence from a collection of fragments with overlapping sequences of letters, Sanger and his co-workers were able, after years of effort, to reconstruct the complete primary structure of insulin. Since then, most of the steps involved in sequencing a polypeptide have been automated. However, it was Sanger's analysis of insulin that first demonstrated what is now a fundamental axiom of molecular biology: A protein has a unique primary structure, a precise sequence of amino acids.

Secondary Structure. Most proteins have segments of their polypeptide chain repeatedly coiled or folded in patterns that contribute to the protein's overall conformation. These coils and folds, collectively referred to as secondary structure, are the result of hydrogen bonds at regular intervals along the polypeptide backbone (FIGURE 5.20). Only the atoms of the backbone are involved, not the amino acid side chains. Both the oxygen and the nitrogen atoms of the backbone are electronegative, with partial negative charges (see Chapter 2). The weakly positive hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom has an affinity for the oxygen atom of a nearby peptide bond. Individually, these hydrogen bonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein. One such secondary structure is the a helix, a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid. The regions of a helix in the enzyme lysozyme are evident in FIGURE 5.20, where one a helix is enlarged to show the hydrogen bonds. Lysozyme is fairly typical of a globular protein in that it has a few stretches of a helix separated by nonhelical regions. In contrast, some fibrous proteins, such as a-keratin, the structural protein of hair, have the a-helix formation over most of their length.

Fig 5-20. The secondary structure of a protein. Two types of secondary structure, the a helix and the b pleated sheet, can both be found in the protein lysozyme. Both patterns depend on hydrogen bonding between * groups along the polypeptide backbone. The R groups of the amino acids are omitted in these diagrams, as are the hydrogen atoms not involved in hydrogen bonding.

The other main type of secondary structure is the b pleated sheet, in which two or more regions of the polypeptide chain lie parallel to each other. Hydrogen bonds between the parts of the backbone in the parallel regions hold the structure together. Pleated sheets make up the core of many globular proteins, and we can see one such region in lysozyme in FIGURE 5.20. Also, pleated sheets dominate some fibrous proteins, including the silk produced by many insects and spiders (FIGURE 5.21). The silk protein of a spider's web contains many regions of b pleated sheet. The teamwork of so many hydrogen bonds makes each silk fiber stronger than steel.

Fig 5-21. Spider silk: a structural protein. The silk protein owes its strength and resilience largely to its secondary structure: It contains many regions of b pleated sheets. When an insect is unfortunate enough to fly into the web, the silk fibers first uncoil and stretch, absorbing the shock, and then rewind, trapping the prey.

Tertiary Structure. Superimposed on the patterns of secondary structure is a protein's tertiary structure, consisting of irregular contortions from interactions between side chains (R groups) of the various amino acids (FIGURE 5.22). One of the types of interaction that contributes to tertiary structure is--somewhat misleadingly--called a hydrophobic interaction. As a polypeptide folds into its functional conformation, amino acids with hydrophobic (nonpolar) side chains usually end up in clusters at the core of the protein, out of contact with water. Thus, what we call a hydrophobic interaction is actually caused by the action of water molecules, which exclude nonpolar substances as they hydrogen-bond to one another and to hydrophilic parts of the protein. Once nonpolar amino acid side chains are close together, van der Waals interactions help hold them together. Meanwhile, hydrogen bonds between polar side chains and ionic bonds between positively and negatively charged side chains also help stabilize tertiary structure. These are all weak interactions, but their cumulative effect helps give the protein a specific shape.

Fig 5-22. Examples of interactions contributing to the tertiary structure of a protein. Hydrophobic side chains usually end up in the interior of a protein, away from water. Along with this clustering of hydrophobic groups, misleadingly called hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals interactions are all weak interactions (weak bonds) between side chains that collectively hold the protein in a specific conformation. Much stronger are the disulfide bridges, covalent bonds between the side chains of two cysteine amino acids. This diagram shows only one small part of a hypothetical protein.

The conformation of a protein may be reinforced further by strong, covalent bonds called disulfide bridges. Disulfide bridges form where two cysteine monomers, amino acids with sulfhydryl groups (--SH) on their side chains, are brought close together by the folding of the protein. The sulfur of one cysteine bonds to the sulfur of the second, and the disulfide bridge (--S--S--) rivets parts of the protein together. (The yellow lines in FIGURES 5.17 and 5.20 represent disulfide bridges.) All of these different kinds of bonds can occur in one protein, as shown diagramatically in FIGURE 5.22.

Quaternary Structure. As mentioned previously, some proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains aggregated into one functional macromolecule. Quaternary structure is the overall protein structure that results from the aggregation of these polypeptide subunits. For example, collagen is a fibrous protein that has helical subunits supercoiled into a larger triple helix (FIGURE 5.23a). This supercoiled organization of collagen, which is similar to the construction of a rope, gives the long fibers great strength. This suits collagen fibers to their function as the girders of connective tissue in skin, bone, tendons, ligaments, and other body parts. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of red blood cells, is an example of a globular protein with quaternary structure (FIGURE 5.23b). It consists of two kinds of polypeptide chains, with two of each kind per hemoglobin molecule.

Fig 5-23. The quaternary structure of proteins. At this level of structure, two or more polypeptide subunits associate to form a functional protein. (a) Collagen is a fibrous protein consisting of three helical polypeptides that are supercoiled to form a ropelike structure of great strength. Accounting for 40%  of the protein in the human body, collagen strengthens connective tissue throughout the body. (b) Hemoglobin is a globular protein with four polypeptide subunits, two of one kind (a chains) and two of another kind (b chains). Both a and b subunits consist primarily of a-helical secondary structure, represented by the thicker cylindrical sections of the polypeptides in this model. (Each subunit has a nonpolypeptide component, called heme, with an iron atom that binds oxygen.)

We have taken the reductionist approach in dissecting proteins to their four levels of structural organization. However, it is the overall product, a macromolecule with a unique shape, that works in a cell. The specific function of a protein is an emergent property that arises from the architecture of the molecule. FIGURE 5.24 reviews the levels of protein structure.

What Determines Protein Conformation?

You've learned that unique conformation endows each protein with a specific function, but what are the key factors determining conformation? You already know most of the answer: A polypeptide chain of a given amino acid sequence can spontaneously arrange itself into a three-dimensional shape determined and maintained by the interactions responsible for secondary and tertiary structure. This normally occurs as the protein is being synthesized within the cell. However, protein conformation also depends on the physical and chemical conditions of the protein's environment. If the pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other aspects of its environment are altered, the protein may unravel and lose its native conformation, a change called denaturation (FIGURE 5.25). Because it is misshapen, the denatured protein is biologically inactive. Most proteins become denatured if they are transferred from an aqueous environment to an organic solvent, such as ether or chloroform; the protein turns inside out, its hydrophobic regions changing places with its hydrophilic portions. Other denaturation agents include chemicals that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and disulfide bridges that maintain a protein's shape. Denaturation can also result from excessive heat, which agitates the polypeptide chain enough to overpower the weak interactions that stabilize conformation. The white of an egg becomes opaque during cooking because the denatured proteins are insoluble and solidify.

Fig 5-25. Denaturation and renaturation of a protein. High temperatures or various chemical treatments will denature a protein, causing it to lose its conformation and hence its ability to function. If the denatured protein remains dissolved, it can often renature when the chemical and physical aspects of its environment are restored to normal.

When a protein in a test-tube solution has been denatured by heat or chemicals, it will often return to its functional shape when the denaturing agent is removed. We can conclude that the information for building specific shape is intrinsic in the protein's primary structure. The sequence of amino acids determines conformation--where an a helix can form, where b pleated sheets can occur, where disulfide bridges are located, where ionic bonds can form, and so on. However, in the crowded environment inside a cell, correct folding may be more of a problem than it is in a test tube.

The Protein-Folding Problem

Biochemists now know the amino acid sequences of more than 100,000 proteins and the three-dimensional shapes of about 10,000. One would think that by correlating the primary structures of many proteins with their conformations, it would be relatively easy to discover the rules of protein folding. Unfortunately, the protein-folding problem is not that simple. Most proteins probably go through several intermediate states on their way to a stable conformation, and looking at the "mature" conformation does not reveal the stages of folding that are required to achieve that form. However, biochemists have developed methods for tracking a protein through its intermediate stages of folding. Researchers have also discovered chaperonins (also called chaperone proteins), protein molecules that assist the proper folding of other proteins. Chaperonins do not actually specify the correct final structure of a polypeptide. Instead they work by keeping the new polypeptide segregated from "bad influences" in the cytoplasmic environment while it folds spontaneously. One well-studied chaperonin, from the bacterium E. coli, is a giant multiprotein complex shaped like a hollow cylinder. The cavity provides a shelter for folding polypeptides of various types (FIGURE 5.26).

Fig 5-26. A chaperonin in action. The computer graphic shows a large chaperonin protein "complex" with an interior space that provides a shelter for the proper folding of newly made polypeptides. The complex consists of two proteins, with a total of 21 polypeptide subunits and a mass of almost 900,000 daltons! One protein is a hollow cylinder; the other is a cap that can fit on either end.

Beyond the reach of today's computers, the simulation of protein folding is the goal of a five-year project at the IBM Corporation. Scientists at IBM aim to develop an extraordinarily powerful supercomputer, to be called Blue Gene, able to generate the three-dimensional structure of any protein starting from its amino acid sequence (or from the gene sequence that encodes the amino acid sequence). Among the practical benefits of this project may be the discovery of protein-folding principles that can be used to design custom proteins for medical and other uses.

Determining the Structure of a Protein

Even when scientists have an actual protein in hand, determining its exact three-dimensional structure is not simple, for a single protein molecule is built of thousands of atoms. FIGURE 5.27 describes X-ray crystallography, the main method used for the task. X-ray crystallography depends on the diffraction (deflection) of an X-ray beam by the individual atoms in a crystal of the protein. After the spatial coordinates of the atoms are determined in this way, a model of the protein is built. Linus Pauling and other pioneers of molecular biology built models from wood, wire, and plastic model sets. Computers have made it possible to build models much more quickly.

Fig 5-27. X-ray crystallography. This series of illustrations (from the Department of Biochemistry at the University of California, Riverside) shows how scientists determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein using X-ray crystallography. The protein here is an enzyme called ribonuclease, whose function involves binding to a nucleic acid molecule. Before X-ray crystallography can be carried out, the protein must be crystallized, in this case in combination with a short strand of nucleic acid. Computer analysis of the results of X-ray crystallography result in a map of all the atoms of the molecules in three-dimensional space. Finally, the scientists use other computer software to generate a three-dimensional model of the enzyme and nucleic acid.





 Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information

There are two types of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). These are the molecules that enable living organisms to reproduce their complex components from one generation to the next. Unique among molecules, DNA provides directions for its own replication. DNA also directs RNA synthesis and, through RNA, controls protein synthesis.

DNA is the genetic material that organisms inherit from their parents. A DNA molecule is very long and usually consists of hundreds or thousands of genes. When a cell reproduces itself by dividing, its DNA molecules (one per chromosome) are copied and passed along from one generation of cells to the next. Encoded in the structure of DNA is the information that programs all the cell's activities. The DNA, however, is not directly involved in running the operations of the cell, any more than computer software by itself can print a bank statement or read the bar code on a box of cereal. Just as a printer is needed to print out a statement and a scanner is needed to read a bar code, proteins are required to implement genetic programs. The molecular hardware of the cell--the tools for most biological functions--consists of proteins. For example, it is the protein hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood, not the DNA that specifies the structure of hemoglobin.

How does RNA, the other type of nucleic acid, fit into the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins? Each gene along the length of a DNA molecule directs the synthesis of a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA molecule then interacts with the cell's protein-synthesizing machinery to direct the production of a polypeptide. We can summarize the flow of genetic information as DN  RNA  protein (FIGURE 5.28, p. 82). The actual sites of protein synthesis are cellular structures called ribosomes. In a eukaryotic cell, ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm, but DNA resides in the nucleus. Messenger RNA conveys the genetic instructions for building proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells lack nuclei, but they still use RNA to send a message from the DNA to the ribosomes and other equipment of the cell that translate the coded information into amino acid sequences.

Fig 5-28. DN  RNA  protein: a diagrammatic overview of information flow in a cell. In a eukaryotic cell, DNA in the nucleus programs protein production in the cytoplasm by dictating the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), which travels to the cytoplasm and binds to ribosomes. As a ribosome (greatly enlarged in this drawing) moves along the mRNA, the genetic message is translated into a polypeptide of specific amino acid sequence.





 A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides

Nucleic acids are polymers of monomers called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is itself composed of three parts: an organic molecule called a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (FIGURE 5.29a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 5-29. The components of nucleic acids. (a) Nucleotides, the monomers of nucleic acids, are themselves composed of three smaller molecular building blocks: a nitrogenous base (either a purine or a pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, (either deoxyribose or ribose), and a phosphate group. RNA has ribose as its sugar, and DNA has deoxyribose. Also, RNA has uracil, and DNA has thymine. (b) The three components of a nucleotide are linked together as shown here. (c) In polynucleotides, each nucleotide monomer has its phosphate group bonded to the sugar of the next nucleotide. The polymer has a regular sugar-phosphate backbone with variable appendages, the four kinds of nitrogenous bases. RNA usually exists in the form of a single polynucleotide, like the one shown here.

There are two families of nitrogenous bases: pyrimidines and purines. A pyrimidine has a six-membered ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms. (The nitrogen atoms tend to take up H+ from solution, which explains the term nitrogenous base.) The members of the pyrimidine family are cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). Purines are larger, with the six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The purines are adenine (A) and guanine (G). The specific pyrimidines and purines differ in the functional groups attached to the rings. Adenine, guanine, and cytosine are found in both types of nucleic acid. Thymine is found only in DNA and uracil only in RNA.

The pentose connected to the nitrogenous base is ribose in the nucleotides of RNA and deoxyribose in DNA. The only difference between these two sugars is that deoxyribose lacks an oxygen atom on its number 2 carbon--hence its name.

So far, we have built a nucleoside, which is a nitrogenous base joined to a sugar. To complete the construction of a nucleotide, we attach a phosphate group to the number 5 carbon of the sugar (FIGURE 5.29b). The molecule is now a nucleoside monophosphate, better known as a nucleotide.

In a nucleic acid polymer, or polynucleotide, nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds called phosphodiester linkages between the phosphate of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next. This bonding results in a backbone with a repeating pattern of sugar-phosphate units (FIGURE 5.29c). All along this sugar-phosphate backbone are appendages consisting of the nitrogenous bases.

The sequence of bases along a DNA (or mRNA) polymer is unique for each gene. Because genes are hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long, the number of possible base sequences is effectively limitless. A gene's meaning to the cell is encoded in its specific sequence of the four DNA bases. For example, the sequence AGGTAACTT means one thing, whereas the sequence CGCTTTAAC has a different translation. (Real genes, of course, are much longer.) The linear order of bases in a gene specifies the amino acid sequence--the primary structure--of a protein, which in turn specifies that protein's three-dimensional conformation and function in the cell.





 Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix

The RNA molecules of cells consist of a single polynucleotide chain like the one shown in FIGURE 5.29. In contrast, cellular DNA molecules have two polynucleotides that spiral around an imaginary axis to form a double helix (FIGURE 5.30, p. 84). James Watson and Francis Crick, working at Cambridge University, first proposed the double helix as the three-dimensional structure of DNA in 1953. The two sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix, and the nitrogenous bases are paired in the interior of the helix. The two polynucleotides, or strands, as they are called, are held together by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases and by van der Waals interactions between the stacked bases. Most DNA molecules are very long, with thousands or even millions of base pairs connecting the two chains. One long DNA double helix includes many genes, each one a particular segment of the molecule.

Fig 5-30. The DNA double helix and its replication. The DNA molecule is usually double-stranded, with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the polynucleotides (symbolized here by blue ribbons) on the outside of the helix. In the interior are pairs of nitrogenous bases, holding the two strands together by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding between the bases is specific. As illustrated here with symbolic shapes for the bases, adenine (A) can pair only with thymine (T), and guanine (G) can pair only with cytosine (C). As a cell prepares to divide, the two strands of the double helix separate, and each serves as a template for the precise ordering of nucleotides into new complementary strands (orange). Each DNA strand in this figure is the structural equivalent of the polynucleotide diagrammed in FIGURE 5.29c.

Only certain bases in the double helix are compatible with each other. Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C). If we were to read the sequence of bases along one strand as we traveled the length of the double helix, we would know the sequence of bases along the other strand. If a stretch of one strand has the base sequence AGGTCCG, then the base-pairing rules tell us that the same stretch of the other strand must have the sequence TCCAGGC. The two strands of the double helix are complementary, each the predictable counterpart of the other. It is this feature of DNA that makes possible the precise copying of genes that is responsible for inheritance (FIGURE 5.30, p. 84). In preparation for cell division, each of the two strands of a DNA molecule serves as a template to order nucleotides into a new complementary strand. The result is two identical copies of the original double-stranded DNA molecule, which are then distributed to the two daughter cells. Thus, the structure of DNA accounts for its function in transmitting genetic information whenever a cell reproduces.





 We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution

Genes (DNA) and their products (proteins) document the hereditary background of an organism. The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are passed from parents to offspring, and these DNA sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins. Siblings have greater similarity in their DNA and proteins than do unrelated individuals of the same species. If the evolutionary view of life is valid, we should be able to extend this concept of "molecular genealogy" to relationships between species: We should expect two species that appear to be closely related based on fossil and anatomical evidence to also share a greater proportion of their DNA and protein sequences than do more distantly related species. That is the case. For example, TABLE 5.2 compares a polypeptide chain of human hemoglobin with the corresponding hemoglobin polypeptide in five other vertebrates. In this chain of 146 amino acids, humans and gorillas differ in just one amino acid. More distantly related species have chains that are less similar. Molecular biology has added a new tape measure to the toolkit biologists use to assess evolutionary kinship.
