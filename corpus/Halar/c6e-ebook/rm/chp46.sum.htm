Variations on these two modes are made possible through parthenogenesis, hermaphroditism, and sequential hermaphroditism. Reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones and environmental cues, such as changes in temperature, rainfall, day length, and seasonal lunar cycles.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">MECHANISMS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">In external fertilization, eggs shed by the female are fertilized by sperm in the external environment.

Internal fertilization requires important behavioral interactions between male and female animals, as well as compatible copulatory organs.</p></LI><LI><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Species with internal fertilization usually produce fewer zygotes but provide more parental protection than species with external fertilization (pp. 978-979,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.5</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Greater protection of embryos and parental care of the young usually follow the production of relatively few offspring by internal fertilization.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Complex reproductive systems have evolved in many animal phyla (pp. 979-980,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 46.6</span>, <span class="SmallCap">46.7</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Reproductive systems range from the production of gametes by undifferentiated cells in the body cavity to complex assemblages of male and female gonads with accessory tubes and glands that carry and protect gametes and developing embryos. The reproductive systems of insects and flatworms are among the most complex in the animal kingdom.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Human reproduction involves intricate anatomy and complex behavior (pp. 980-984,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 46.8</span>, <span class="SmallCap">46.9</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> External reproductive structures of the human male are the scrotum and penis. The male gonads, or testes, reside in the cool environment of the scrotum. They possess endocrine Leydig cells surrounding sperm-forming seminiferous tubules that successively lead into the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and urethra, which exits at the tip of the penis. Externally, the human female has a vestibule containing separate openings of the vagina and urethra, the labia minora bordering the vestibule, the labia majora, and the clitoris. Internally, the vagina is connected to the uterus, which connects to two oviducts. Two ovaries (female gonads) are stocked with follicles containing diploid primary oocytes formed before the woman’s birth. Beginning at puberty, one or more follicles mature during each menstrual cycle. The oocyte contained in a maturing follicle completes the first meiotic division, and a secondary oocyte, which is haploid, is expelled from the surface of the ovary during ovulation. After ovulation, the remnant of the follicle forms a corpus luteum that secretes progesterone and estrogen for a variable duration, depending on whether or not pregnancy occurs. Although separate from the reproductive system, the mammary glands, or breasts, evolved in association with parental care. Both males and females experience the erection of certain body tissues due to vasocongestion and myotonia, which culminate in orgasm.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity46A:<span class="Emphasis1">

Androgen secretion and sperm production are both controlled by hypothalamic and pituitary hormones. Female hormones are secreted in a rhythmic fashion reflected in the menstrual or estrous cycle. In both types of female cycles, the endometrium thickens in preparation for possible implantation. The menstrual cycle, however, includes endometrial bleeding and lacks the clear-cut period of sexual receptivity limited to the heat period of the estrous cycle. The human menstrual cycle consists of the menstrual flow phase, proliferative phase, and secretory phase. The ovarian cycle includes the follicular and luteal phases. The female reproductive cycle is orchestrated by cyclic secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. The developing follicle produces estrogens, and the corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogens. Positive and negative feedback produce the changing levels of these five hormones, which coordinate the menstrual and ovarian cycles.</p></LI><LI><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Embryonic and fetal development occur during pregnancy in humans and other eutherian (placental) mammals (pp. 989-995,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 46.16</span>-<span class="SmallCap">46.21</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Human pregnancy can be divided into three trimesters. Organogenesis is completed by 8 weeks. Birth, or parturition, results from strong, rhythmic uterine contractions associated with labor. Positive feedback involving the hormones estrogen and oxytocin, and prostaglandins, regulate labor. A pregnant woman’s acceptance of her "foreign" fetus may be due to the suppression of the immune response in her uterus. Contraceptive methods include preventing the release of mature gametes from the gonads, preventing gamete union in the female tract, and preventing implantation of the zygote.</p></LI><LI><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Modern technology offers solutions for some reproductive problems (p. 995,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.22</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Current methods of detecting fetal condition include ultrasound imaging, amniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling.
