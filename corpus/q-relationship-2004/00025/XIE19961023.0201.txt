Sending the People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- troops to Hong Kong on July 1 , 1997 has become a matter of concern among Hong Kong residents .

Fu Quanyou , a member of the Central Military Commission -LRB- CMC -RRB- and chief of the general staff of the PLA , explained the draft to the 22nd session of the National People 's Congress Standing Committee , which opened in Beijing today .
`` The stipulations were based on the Basic Law of the HK SAR , and with reference to British Army practices in Hong Kong , '' Fu said .
The draft Law notes that `` criminal cases involving troops stationed in Hong Kong will be handled by the military judiciary , but that crimes committed by off-duty personnel , in which the person or the property of both Hong Kong residents and others , with the exception of the stationed military personnel , are infringed upon , will be handled by the courts of the HK SAR . ''
Cases in which soldiers violate the civil rights of Hong Kong residents of other persons , except for military personnel , will be dealt with by courts of the HK SAR , but when the violations involve on-duty personnel , the cases are to be handled by the Supreme People 's Court of the People 's Republic of China .
