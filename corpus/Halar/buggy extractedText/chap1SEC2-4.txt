 Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization

Given a choice of tools, you would not loosen a screw with a hammer or pound a nail with a screwdriver. How a device works is correlated with its structure: Form fits function. Applied to biology, this theme is a guide to the anatomy of life at its many structural levels, from molecules to organisms. Analyzing a biological structure gives us clues about what it does and how it works. Conversely, knowing the function of a structure provides insight about its construction.

An example of this structure-function theme is the aerodynamically efficient shape of a bird's wing (FIGURE 1.6). The skeleton of the bird also has structural qualities that contribute to flight, with bones that have a strong but light honeycombed internal structure. The flight muscles of a bird are controlled by neurons (nerve cells), which transmit impulses. With their long extensions, neurons are especially well structured for communication. The flight muscles need plenty of energy, which they obtain from organelles called mitochondria. These organelles are the sites of cellular respiration, the chemical process that powers the cell by using oxygen to help tap the energy stored in sugar and other food molecules. A mitochondrion has an inner membrane with many infoldings. Molecules embedded in the inner membrane carry out many of the steps in cellular respiration, and the infoldings pack a large amount of this membrane into a minute container (see FIGURE 1.6d). In exploring life on its different structural levels, we discover functional beauty at every turn.
