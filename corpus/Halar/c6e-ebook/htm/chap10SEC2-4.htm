The light reactions use solar energy to make ATP and NADPH, which function as chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, in the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle incorporates CO<SUB>2</SUB> into organic molecules, which are converted to sugar. (Recall from Chapter 5 that most simple sugars have formulas that are some multiple of CH<SUB>2</SUB>O.)</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of electrons and hydrogen from water to an acceptor called <span class="Emphasis2">NADP<SUP>+</SUP></span>1 (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which temporarily stores the energized electrons. Water is split in the process, and thus it is the light reactions of photosynthesis that give off O<SUB>2</SUB> as a by-product. The electron acceptor of the light reactions, NADP<SUP>+</SUP>, is first cousin to NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP<SUP>+</SUP> molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP<SUP>+</SUP> to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with a hydrogen nucleus, or H<SUP>+</SUP>. The light reactions also generate ATP by powering the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called <span class="Emphasis2">photophosphorylation.</span> Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of energized electrons ("reducing power"), and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO<SUB>2</SUB> from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as <span class="Emphasis2">carbon fixation.</span> The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired energized electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO<SUB>2</SUB> to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light <span class="Emphasis1">directly.</span> Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions regenerate the NADPH and ATP spent in the reduction of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to sugar. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">As <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.4</span> indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. As molecules of NADP<SUP>+</SUP> and ADP bump into the thylakoid membrane, they pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and then transfer their high-energy cargo to the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. Our next step toward understanding photosynthesis is to look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
