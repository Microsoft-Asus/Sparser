MOSCOW , September 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that Moscow recognizes the presence of territorial problem with Tokyo , but will not transfer the Kuriles Islands to Japan .
Putin made the remarks in Russia 's Far East city of Sakhalinsk on Sunday morning before leaving for Tokyo for a day official visit , Russian media reported .
`` Russia recognizes there is territorial problem between Russia and Japan , but there is no question of turning over the Kuriles , '' he told reporters .
`` We admit the presence of the problem , but no more than that , '' he stressed .
He noted that Moscow never stated intentions to hand over these islands to Japan and is just negotiating with Tokyo over the dispute .
The dispute over the sovereignty of the Kuriles , which Japan calls `` Four North Islands , '' has had a negative influence on the development of the Russian - Japan relations for a long time .
It has been the biggest obstacle for the two countries to conclude a peace treaty since the end of the World War II .
Observers say the two sides will hardly achieve any progress in this issue during Putin 's visit to Japan .
