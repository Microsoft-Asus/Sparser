WASHINGTON --
The man who directed the global campaign that eradicated smallpox from the Earth now believes the United States should spend between $ 25 and $ 50 million as soon as possible to stockpile vaccine against the disease .
Donald A. Henderson , a former epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- in Atlanta , said security problems in biological warfare laboratories created by the former Soviet Union , along with documented interest in bioterrorism in Iraq and among Japanese cult members , convince him that `` the level of danger has changed . ''
`` We have a population that has effectively received no vaccine for 30 years '' and has lost its immunity , Henderson said in an interview , `` and it looks to me like we have a much more volatile situation that we had thought . ''
Henderson , now dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health , in the 1960s was the first director of a CDC program to eradicate smallpox from 18 West African countries .
When this program led to a decision by the World Health Organization to launch a global eradication campaign , he left CDC to direct the WHO effort .
Smallpox was officially declared eradicated from the Earth in 1980 .
Now , following the fall of the Soviet government , defectors and others have revealed that Soviet scientists were working with smallpox as a biological weapon and had stockpiled a still-unknown quantity of the deadly virus .
Because of economic problems in the Soviet Union , many of the `` cutting edge '' virologists who worked in these facilities have left , Henderson said , and guards have complained that they have not been paid for months .
In addition , the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult in Japan is believed by some investigators to have up to $ 1 billion and as many as 16,000 adherents in Russia , even though its leader has been jailed , Henderson said .
The cult burst into headlines in 1995 , when it released deadly sarin nerve gas in a Tokyo subway , killing a dozen people .
Since then , evidence has come to light that members have tried several times to obtain biological weapons and use them , once at a U.S. military base in Japan .
Combined with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 's now-documented interest in biological warfare , the developments in Japan and Russia mean `` we have every reason to be concerned '' that an epidemic of smallpox could be deliberately started in the United States , Henderson said .
`` I 'd like to see us with ample possibility to provide protection if that happens , '' he said .
`` At this time , there is no vaccine manufacturing capability in this country and to my knowledge , anywhere in the world . ''
Henderson did not advocate the preventive inoculation of Americans before an attack .
In a mass campaign to give millions of people the vaccine , a few would be expected to die from side effects .
He estimated that the cost of establishing a manufacturing facility and producing 150 million doses of smallpox vaccine would be between $ 25 and $ 50 million .
Henderson also said he thinks the United States should spend about $ 1 billion to upgrade the public health system in preparation for a possible epidemic caused by terrorists .
`` If one looks at bioterrorism , you 're looking at a situation in which you 're going to see an epidemic emerge , '' Henderson said .
`` You 'd like to detect that epidemic as soon as possible so you could start vaccinating people .
Who 's going to do that ?
The medical community , state and local health departments and CDC .
Yet no money has been made available to anybody in these areas yet . ''
