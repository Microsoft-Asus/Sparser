WASHINGTON --
Top CIA officials impeded an internal investigation into evidence that the agency 's former director , John Deutch , mishandled large volumes of secret material , a classified report by the agency 's inspector general concludes .
The report details a series of actions by the agency 's former executive director and general counsel that it says `` had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this matter . ''
It asserts that George Tenet , the agency 's current director and Deutch 's top deputy , should have done more to `` forcefully ensure '' that the case was properly investigated .
But the report also says that Tenet said he had given instructions that the investigation go forward unimpeded .
The report did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating any laws in their handling of the incident .
But at the inspector general 's recommendation , the CIA has set up a special panel to examine whether Tenet and other top officials handled the case appropriately .
The investigation of Deutch began in December 1996 , just as he was leaving office .
According to the inspector general 's report , CIA computer security specialists discovered he had placed large volumes of classified material on personal computers in his home , including information about some of the government 's most sensitive covert operations .
This was a potential violation of both agency rules and federal law , but the report says an inquiry by security officials was effectively shelved after a few months .
The CIA did not tell the Justice Department about the case for more than a year .
The inspector general did so in early 1998 , after an agency employee complained to the inspector general 's office that the inquiry had not been properly handled , according to officials knowledgeable about the investigation .
Tenet learned of the possible security breach almost immediately but did not move to reprimand Deutch until the inspector general had notified the Justice Department of a possible violation and completed his report on how the case had been handled inside the CIA .
After reviewing the case , the Justice Department decided last April not to prosecute Deutch , who lost his security clearances .
He issued a statement in August apologizing for his actions .
Running afoul of the government 's elaborate rules for handling paper and computer files can be a serious matter .
Wen Ho Lee , the former Los Alamos computer scientist who is being held without bail awaiting trial , has been indicted for what prosecutors say is the unauthorized downloading of massive amounts of nuclear secrets .
The inspector general 's report discloses that just three days after Deutch learned that his computer practices were under review , he deleted more than 1,000 classified files from his personal computers .
The report also says that Deutch declined to be interviewed by the CIA 's security officials .
The inspector general found that there was no evidence that the classified material on Deutch 's computers was obtained by another country , although there was no way to be certain .
In the case of Lee , by contrast , the government has charged that he transferred and copied nuclear secrets with the intent of aiding a foreign country , although prosecutors say they have no evidence he committed espionage .
As the CIA case unfolded in late 1996 and early 1997 , the report says , it was closely watched by Tenet , Michael O'Neill , the agency 's general counsel at the time , and Nora Slatkin , its executive director .
Frustrated by limits the report says were imposed on them , CIA security officers concluded that senior officials were protecting Deutch and `` washed their hands '' of the case .
One security officer told the inspector general that the `` investigation had been one in name only . ''
The case raises anew a question that has plagued the agency for the last two decades : Can the CIA police itself ?
Over the years , Congress has prodded the agency to appoint forceful inspector generals and included the director of central intelligence among the handful of top officials subject to investigation by an independent counsel .
Lawmakers made it clear that agency officials who blocked or misled internal investigators should be harshly dealt with .
The inspector general 's report on the Deutch case suggests that these safeguards depend on how the agency 's leadership interprets the rules .
Tenet and other senior CIA officials did not immediately report Deutch 's possible security lapses to the White House or congressional oversight committees .
Their delay in telling the Justice Department about the case allowed a one-year time limit on appointing an independent counsel to lapse .
`` Application of the independent counsel statute was not adequately considered '' by CIA officials handling the case , the report says .
`` Given their failure to report to the Department of Justice on a timely basis , this in effect avoided the potential application of the independent counsel statute . ''
The statute expired in 1999 .
Agency officials said there was never any effort by anyone to constrain the inquiry and that the report , by Inspector General Britt Snider , was overly harsh in its interpretation of ambiguous events and remarks .
In addition , they said , the security officials interviewed by the inspector general 's office portrayed themselves as more assertive than they were in their investigation of Deutch .
The report specifically cites O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin for impeding the inquiry .
It also criticizes Snider 's predecessor as inspector general , Frederick Hitz , for failing to `` ensure the timely and definitive resolution '' of the case .
Only a few details about the Deutch case and the inspector general 's classified report , which was completed in July , have previously been made public .
Deutch emphasized that he never tried to block the CIA 's investigation .
`` I have cooperated fully with the inspector general 's inquiry , and at no time did I do anything intended to impede or interfere in any way with any investigation into this matter , '' Deutch said through his lawyer .
O'Neill said in an interview that he believed he had acted properly .
`` I did not try to delay the investigation of Deutch , '' he said .
`` This was a difficult circumstance , '' Ms. Slatkin said in a statement .
`` Our goal was to have a fair and thorough review and I think we did precisely that . ''
Hitz defended his actions as proper and said that in early 1998 he had notified the Intelligence Oversight Board , a White House panel , about the Deutch case and was preparing to notify the Justice Department but left the matter to his successor after he left the CIA .
Deutch joined the Clinton administration in 1993 as under secretary of defense for acquisitions and technology .
In 1994 , he was named deputy secretary of defense , the No. 2 post at the Pentagon .
In May 1995 , Deutch was confirmed as director of central intelligence .
When Deutch moved to the CIA , he named as deputy director Tenet , then serving at the White House as director of intelligence policy for the National Security Council .
He also named Ms. Slatkin , then assistant secretary of the Navy , to be the CIA 's executive director , the third-ranking position at the agency .
O'Neill , a former Democratic congressional staff member , was named Deutch 's chief of staff in 1995 .
In 1996 he became the CIA 's general counsel .
After taking over at the CIA , Deutch decided not to have a classified computer installed in his suburban Maryland home , and also declined to have CIA security officers assigned there .
One job of officers assigned to the home of a director is the securing of classified material the director has brought from work , the inspector general 's report states .
According to the report , Deutch used unclassified Macintosh computers for classified work throughout his tenure as director .
He chose not to conduct sensitive work on the classified computer system at the CIA because he said he was afraid that other CIA officials would see what he was writing , according to the report .
Deutch placed the most sensitive documents that he worked on while he was director on the unclassified computers in his home , the report found .
Among the 17,000 pages of documents discovered in files on the computers were top-secret and `` code-word '' files about a wide range of CIA activities , including presidentially approved covert action programs .
The documents also included 26 volumes detailing his daily activities in his nearly two years as director and his previous time at the Pentagon .
After losing out on his bid to become secretary of defense in President Clinton 's second term , Deutch announced in early December 1996 his intention to resign as director of central intelligence and return to academic life at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he now teaches chemistry .
Within days of announcing he was leaving , Deutch talked with a top computer services official at the CIA and told him that he wanted to keep the CIA -owned Macintosh computers in his home after he left the government .
Deutch explained that he wanted them because he was using them for his personal banking .
Eventually , Deutch was told by the computer official that he could keep the computers if he continued to work for the CIA as a consultant or contractor .
Deutch then quickly arranged through O'Neill to obtain a no-fee consulting contract with the CIA The terms called for him to retain three CIA computers .
The inspector general 's report indicates that the purpose of the contract was to allow Deutch to keep his computers .
On Dec. 17 , a CIA computer security official went to Deutch 's home and found a large number of classified documents stored on his computers .
He also found that Deutch had been accessing the Internet with the same computers , through unsecured services .
He had Internet access through America Online , Citibank 's personal banking Web site and a Defense Department service .
The security official told his superiors what he had found .
Almost immediately , O'Neill and Ms. Slatkin were informed that classified material had been found on the computers .
Tenet was soon told about the discovery by Ms. Slatkin .
On Dec. 20 , 1996 , Deutch began to delete files from his computers , including more than 1,000 that had been stored on one portable memory card .
That day , Deutch called a CIA computer specialist to ask for help because he was having trouble deleting the files , according to the report .
