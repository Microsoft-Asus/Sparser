COLOMBO , November 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar has called on the Commonwealth to focus on terrorism and its effects globally as well as child soldiers , the Government Information Department said Sunday .
It said in a statement that Kadirgamar made the appeal on Saturday at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting -LRB- CHOGM -RRB- presently underway in Durban , South Africa .
Kadirgamar emphasized the need for the international community `` to intensify their collective action against terrorism '' as Sri Lanka has suffered from the devastating phenomenon .
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year -old war between government troops and rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- who demand a separate state in the country 's north and east .
The government has usually branded LTTE rebels as terrorists as they have allegedly been involved in suicide bombing , assassinations and other kinds of terrorist acts .
Referring to the widespread use of child soldiers , Kadirgamar urged the Commonwealth countries to address the problem and emphasized that `` everything possible should be done to stop this abominable phenomenon . ''
Drawing attention to the problem of child soldiers in Sri Lanka , he said children as young as 10 years `` are being used in combat '' by the LTTE guerrillas .
In May 1998 , the LTTE hierarchy gave an undertaking to the United Nations special representative for children and armed conflict Olara Otunnu that they would stop conscripting children under 17 years of age .
But military officials said the LTTE has reneged on their pledge and was continuing to use children as combatants in the armed conflict .
They said the latest proof was the recovery of bodies of 49 child combatants , including 32 girls , in the 11 to 15 age group during a search operation following a fierce battle at Ampakamam in northern Sri Lanka in October .
