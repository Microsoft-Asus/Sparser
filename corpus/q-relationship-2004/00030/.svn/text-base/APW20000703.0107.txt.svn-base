CANOUAN , St. Vincent
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Caribbean leaders on Monday debated a united response to possible sanctions by industrialized nations after a report recently listed several of the islands as havens for money laundering and tax evasion .
The report by the Paris -based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development named five Caribbean countries as centers for international money-laundering by criminal groups .
It cited several more for lax banking rules that allowed wealthy individuals and companies to hide funds from tax collectors in developed nations .
Developed countries have threatened sanctions unless financial controls are tightened -- endangering offshore banking industries that have brought a measure of wealth to these resource-poor countries .
`` They are out to defend their interests , '' Dominica 's Prime Minister Rosie Douglas said Monday , echoing criticism that the rich countries ' high-minded stance amounts to little more than a disguised effort to recoup lost tax revenue .
`` We will not give up our sovereign rights . ''
Still , he conceded that the 15-member Caribbean Community , whose leaders began four days of talks here Monday , must take the charges seriously .
`` We 'll have to review our tax legislation and how it affects Europe and the United States . ''
`` Some corrective measures are needed in Dominica , '' he said .
`` We know in a couple of cases there was money laundering , and we ca n't have that . ''
The United Nations estimates that $ 600 billion in criminal funds is hidden from law enforcement officials every year by such money laundering methods as moving it through offshore accounts , and about $ 60 billion of that passes through Caribbean banking centers .
There are no firm figures of U.S. tax revenue lost to offshore tax havens , but Britain estimates its losses at about $ 1.6 billion a year .
The United States has indicated it will look at the OECD lists , as well as its own studies , when deciding whether to punish countries under new legislation being considered in Congress .
France also is considering similar legislation .
At opening ceremonies for the summit on Sunday , Premier Sir James Mitchell of the host nation St. Vincent condemned the measures under consideration as a `` direct threat to the region 's economic base and stability . ''
Mitchell said that while the region will cooperate to stop money laundering , developing countries should be allowed to offer tax concessions as a way to draw desperately needed business and investment .
`` We in the Caribbean do not aspire to be a refuge for drug barons and money launderers , '' said Mitchell , who is current chairman of Caribbean Community .
`` We are not doing anything illegal or immoral .
Tax competition is about whose treasury gets the money . ''
Five of 15 alleged money laundering centers were identified in the Caribbean , and 15 of 35 countries listed as harmful tax havens are Caribbean nations or territories of Britain , the Netherlands and the United States .
The OECD gave them 12 months to work with the organization to eliminate `` harmful features '' of their tax regimes , or face sanctions .
