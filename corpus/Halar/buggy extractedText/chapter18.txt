The drawing that opens this chapter dramatizes a remarkable event: the genetic takeover of a cell by a virus. In this case, the cell is the bacterium E. coli, and the virus, looking something like a miniature lunar landing craft, is the bacteriophage T4. The phage is infecting the cell by injecting its DNA. InFIGURE 16.2, you met a closely related virus, T2, which helped prove that DNA is the genetic material. Molecular biology was born in the laboratories of microbiologists studying such viruses and bacteria. Microbiologists provided most of the evidence that genes are made of DNA, and they worked out the major steps of DNA replication, transcription, and translation, the three main processes in the flow of genetic information. Viruses and bacteria are the simplest biological systems--microbial models where scientists find life's fundamental molecular mechanisms in their most basic, accessible forms.

The value of viruses and bacteria as model systems in biological research is just one reason to learn about these microbes. While microbial models have helped biologists understand the molecular genetics of more complex organisms, viruses and bacteria also have unique features that make their genetics interesting in their own right. These specialized mechanisms have important applications for understanding how viruses and bacteria cause disease. In addition, techniques enabling scientists to manipulate genes and transfer them from one organism to another have emerged from the study of microbes. These techniques are having an important impact on both basic research and biotechnology (see Chapter 20).

In this chapter, we explore the genetics of viruses and bacteria. Recall that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms, with cells much smaller and more simply organized than those of eukaryotes, such as plants and animals. Viruses are smaller and simpler still, lacking the structures and most of the metabolic machinery found in cells (FIGURE 18.1). In fact, most viruses are little more than aggregates of nucleic acid and protein--genes packaged in protein coats. It is with these simplest of all genetic systems that we begin.

 Researchers discovered viruses by studying a plant disease

Microbiologists were able to detect viruses indirectly long before they were actually able to see them. The story of how viruses were discovered begins in 1883 with Adolf Mayer, a German scientist seeking the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. This disease stunts the growth of tobacco plants and gives their leaves a mottled, or mosaic, coloration (see FIGURE 18.9a). Mayer discovered that the disease was contagious when he found he could transmit it from plant to plant by spraying sap extracted from diseased leaves onto healthy plants. He searched for a microbe in the infectious sap but found none. Mayer concluded that the disease was caused by unusually small bacteria that could not be seen with the microscope. This hypothesis was tested a decade later by Dimitri Ivanowsky, a Russian who passed sap from infected tobacco leaves through a filter designed to remove bacteria. After filtering, the sap still produced mosaic disease.

Ivanowsky clung to the hypothesis that bacteria caused tobacco mosaic disease. Perhaps, he reasoned, the pathogenic bacteria were so small they could pass through the filter. Or perhaps the bacteria made a filterable toxin that caused the disease. This latter possibility was ruled out in 1897 when the Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck discovered that the infectious agent in the filtered sap could reproduce. Beijerinck sprayed plants with the filtered sap, and after these plants developed mosaic disease, he used their sap to infect more plants, continuing this process through a series of infections. The pathogen must have been reproducing, for its ability to cause disease was undiluted after several transfers from plant to plant.

In fact, the pathogen could reproduce only within the host it infected. Unlike bacteria, the mysterious agent of mosaic disease could not be cultivated on nutrient media in test tubes or petri dishes. Also, the pathogen was not inactivated by alcohol, which is generally lethal to bacteria. Beijerinck imagined a reproducing particle much smaller and simpler than bacteria. His suspicions were confirmed in 1935, when the American scientist Wendell Stanley crystallized the infectious particle, now known as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Subsequently, TMV and many other viruses were actually seen with the help of the electron microscope.





 A virus is a genome enclosed in a protective coat

The tiniest viruses are only 20 nm in diameter--smaller than a ribosome. Millions could easily fit on a pinhead. Even the largest viruses can barely be resolved with the light microscope. Stanley's discovery that some viruses could be crystallized was exciting and puzzling news. Not even the simplest of cells can aggregate into regular crystals. But if viruses are not cells, then what are they? They are infectious particles consisting of nucleic acid enclosed in a protein coat and, in some cases, a membranous envelope. Let's examine the structure of viruses more closely; then we'll look at how viruses replicate.

Viral Genomes

We usually think of genes as being made of double-stranded DNA--the conventional double helix--but many viruses defy this convention. Their genomes may consist of double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, or single-stranded RNA, depending on the specific type of virus. A virus is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, according to the kind of nucleic acid that makes up its genome. In either case, the genome is usually organized as a single linear or circular molecule of nucleic acid. The smallest viruses have only four genes, while the largest have several hundred.

Capsids and Envelopes

The protein shell that encloses the viral genome is called a capsid. Depending on the type of virus, the capsid may be rod-shaped (more precisely, helical), polyhedral, or more complex in shape. Capsids are built from a large number of protein subunits called capsomeres, but the number of different kinds of proteins is usually small. Tobacco mosaic virus, for example, has a rigid, rod-shaped capsid made from over a thousand molecules of a single type of protein (FIGURE 18.2a, p. 330). Adenoviruses, which infect the respiratory tracts of animals, have 252 identical protein molecules arranged into a polyhedral capsid with 20 triangular facets--an icosahedron (FIGURE 18.2b).

Fig 18-2. Viral structure. Viruses are made up of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (the capsid) and sometimes further wrapped in a membranous envelope. The individual protein subunits making up the capsid are called capsomeres. Although viruses are diverse in size and shape, there are common structural motifs, most of which appear in the four examples shown here. (All the micrographs are TEMs.)

Some viruses have accessory structures that help them infect their hosts. Influenza viruses, as well as many other viruses found in animals, have viral envelopes, membranes cloaking their capsids (FIGURE 18.2c). These envelopes are derived from membrane of the host cell, but in addition to host cell phospholipids and proteins, they also contain proteins and glycoproteins of viral origin (glycoproteins are proteins with carbohydrate covalently attached). Some viruses carry a few viral enzyme molecules within their capsids.

The most complex capsids are found among viruses that infect bacteria. As you learned in Chapter 16, bacterial viruses are called bacteriophages, or simply phages. The first phages studied included seven that infect the bacterium Escherichia coli. These seven phages were named type 1 (T1), type 2 (T2), and so forth, in the order of their discovery. By coincidence, the three T-even phages--T2, T4, and T6--turned out to be very similar in structure. Their capsids have elongated 20-sided heads that enclose their DNA. Attached to the head is a protein tail piece with tail fibers that the phages use to attach to a bacterium (FIGURE 18.2d).





 Viruses can reproduce only within a host cell: an overview

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; that is, they can reproduce only within a host cell. An isolated virus is unable to reproduce--or do anything else, for that matter, except infect an appropriate host cell. Viruses lack the enzymes for metabolism and have no ribosomes or other equipment for making their own proteins. Thus, isolated viruses are merely packaged sets of genes in transit from one host cell to another.

Each type of virus can infect and parasitize only a limited range of host cells, called its host range. This host specificity depends on the evolution of recognition systems by the virus. Viruses identify their host cells by a "lock-and-key" fit between proteins on the outside of the virus and specific receptor molecules on the surface of the cell. (Presumably, the receptors first evolved because they carried out functions of benefit to the organism.) Some viruses have host ranges broad enough to include several species. Swine flu virus, for example, can infect both hogs and humans, and the rabies virus can infect a number of mammalian species, including raccoons, skunks, dogs, and humans. In other cases, viruses have host ranges so narrow that they infect only a single species. For instance, there are several phages that can parasitize only E. coli.

Viruses of eukaryotes are usually tissue specific. Human cold viruses infect only the cells lining the upper respiratory tract, ignoring other tissues. And the AIDS virus binds to a specific receptor on certain types of white blood cells.

A viral infection begins when the genome of a virus makes its way into a host cell (FIGURE 18.3). The mechanism by which this nucleic acid enters the cell varies, depending on the type of virus. For example, the T-even phages use their elaborate tail apparatus to inject DNA into a bacterium (see the chapter-opening drawing on p. 328). Once inside, the viral genome can commandeer its host, reprogramming the cell to copy the viral nucleic acid and manufacture viral proteins. Most DNA viruses use the DNA polymerases of the host cell to synthesize new genomes along the templates provided by the viral DNA. In contrast, to replicate their genomes, RNA viruses must use special virus-encoded polymerases, ones that can use RNA as a template. (Cells generally have no native enzymes for carrying out such a process.) We will describe the replication of DNA and RNA viruses in more detail later in the chapter.

Fig 18-3. A simplified viral reproductive cycle. A virus is an obligate intracellular parasite that uses the equipment of its host cell to reproduce. In this simplest of viral cycles, the parasite is a DNA virus with a capsid consisting of a single type of protein. 
			  
		 After entering the cell, the viral DNA uses host nucleotides and enzymes to replicate itself. 
			  
		 The viral DNA uses other host resources to produce its capsid proteins by transcription and translation. 
			  
		 The new viral DNA and capsid proteins assemble into new virus particles, which leave the cell.

Regardless of the type of viral genome, the parasite diverts its host's resources for viral production. The host provides the nucleotides for nucleic acid synthesis. It also provides enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, ATP, and other components needed for making the viral proteins dictated by viral genes.

After the viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres are produced, their assembly into new viruses is often a spontaneous process, a process of self-assembly. In fact, the RNA and capsomeres of TMV can be separated in the laboratory and then reassembled to form complete viruses simply by mixing the components together again. The simplest type of viral reproductive cycle is completed when hundreds or thousands of viruses emerge from the infected host cell. The cell is often destroyed in the process. In fact, some of the symptoms of human viral infections, such as colds and influenza, result from cellular damage and death and from the body's responses to this destruction. The viral progeny that exit a cell have the potential to infect additional cells, spreading the viral infection.

There are many variations on the simplified viral reproductive cycle we have traced in this overview. We will see several examples as we take a closer look at some bacterial viruses (phages), animal viruses, and plant viruses.





 Phages reproduce using lytic or lysogenic cycles

The phages are the best understood of all viruses, although some of them are also among the most complex. Research on phages led to the discovery that some double-stranded DNA viruses can reproduce by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.

The Lytic Cycle

A phage reproductive cycle that culminates in death of the host cell is known as a lytic cycle. The term refers to the last stage of infection, during which the bacterium lyses (breaks open) and releases the phages that were produced within the cell. Each of these phages can then infect a healthy cell, and a few successive lytic cycles can destroy an entire bacterial colony in just hours. A phage that reproduces only by a lytic cycle is a virulent phage. FIGURE 18.4 (p. 332) uses the virulent phage T4 to illustrate the steps of a lytic cycle. The figure and legend describe the process, which you should study before proceeding.

Fig 18-4. The lytic cycle of phage T4. Phage T4 has about 100 genes, which are transcribed and translated using the host cell's machinery. One of the first phage genes translated after infection codes for an enzyme that chops up the host cell's DNA (step 3); the phage DNA is protected from breakdown because it contains a modified form of cytosine that is not recognized by the enzyme. The entire lytic cycle, from the phage's first contact with the cell surface to cell lysis, takes only 20-30 minutes at 37&#176;C.

After reading about the lytic cycle, you may wonder why phages haven't exterminated all bacteria. Actually, bacteria are not defenseless. Natural selection favors bacterial mutants with receptor sites that are no longer recognized by a particular type of phage. And when phage DNA successfully enters a bacterium, various cellular enzymes may break it down. Enzymes called restriction nucleases, for example, recognize and cut up DNA that is foreign to the cell, including certain phage DNA. The bacterial cell's own DNA is chemically modified in a way that prevents attack by restriction enzymes. But just as natural selection favors bacteria with effective restriction enzymes, natural selection favors phage mutants that are resistant to these enzymes. Thus, the parasite-host relationship is in constant evolutionary flux.

There is still another important reason bacteria have been spared from extinction as a result of phage activity. Many phages can check their own destructive tendencies and, instead of lysing their host cells, coexist with them in what is called the lysogenic cycle.

The Lysogenic Cycle

In contrast to the lytic cycle, which kills the host cell, the lysogenic cycle replicates the phage genome without destroying the host. Phages that are capable of using both modes of reproducing within a bacterium are called temperate phages. To compare the lytic and lysogenic cycles, we will examine a temperate phage called lambda, written with the Greek letter l. Phage l resembles T4, but its tail has only one short tail fiber.

Infection of an E. coli cell by phage l begins when the phage binds to the surface of the cell and injects its DNA (FIGURE 18.5). Within the host, the l DNA molecule forms a circle. What happens next depends on the reproductive mode: lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle. During a lytic cycle, the viral genes immediately turn the host cell into a l-producing factory, and the cell soon lyses and releases its viral products. The viral genome behaves differently during a lysogenic cycle. The l DNA molecule is incorporated by genetic recombination (crossing over) into a specific site on the host cell's chromosome. It is then known as a prophage. One prophage gene codes for a protein that represses most of the other prophage genes. (This is the repressor protein Nancy Hopkins studied as a graduate student; see p. 232.) Thus, the phage genome is mostly silent within the bacterium. How, then, does the phage reproduce? Every time the E. coli cell prepares to divide, it replicates the phage DNA along with its own and passes the copies on to daughter cells. A single infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form. This mechanism enables viruses to propagate without killing the host cells on which they depend.

Fig 18-5. The lysogenic and lytic reproductive cycles of phage l, a temper-ate phage. After entering the bacterial cell and circularizing, the l DNA can either integrate into the bacterial chromosome (lysogenic cycle) or immediately initiate the production of a large number of progeny phages (lytic cycle). In most cases, the lytic pathway is followed, but once a lysogenic cycle begins, the prophage may be carried in the host cell's chromosome for many generations. Phage l has a single, short tail fiber, not shown in this diagram.

The term lysogenic implies that prophages are capable of giving rise to active phages that lyse their host cells. This occurs when, occasionally, the l genome exits the bacterial chromosome. Once free in the cell, the l genome initiates a lytic cycle. It is usually an environmental trigger, such as radiation or the presence of certain chemicals, that switches the virus from the lysogenic to the lytic mode.

In addition to the gene for the repressor protein, a few other prophage genes may also be expressed during lysogenic cycles, and the expression of these genes may alter the phenotype of the host bacteria. This phenomenon can have important medical significance. For example, the bacteria that cause the human diseases diphtheria, botulism, and scarlet fever would be harmless to humans if it were not for certain prophage genes that induce the host bacteria to make toxins.





 Animal viruses are diverse in their modes of infection and replication

Everyone has suffered from viral infections, whether cold sores, influenza, or the common cold. TABLE 18.1 (p. 334) lists some important classes of animal viruses. Like all viruses, those that cause illness in humans and other animals can reproduce (replicate) only inside host cells.

Reproductive Cycles of Animal Viruses

Many variations on the basic scheme of viral infection and reproduction are represented among the animal viruses. One key variable is the type of nucleic acid that serves as a virus's genetic material (the basis for classification in TABLE 18.1). Another variable is the presence or absence of a membranous envelope. Rather than consider all the mechanisms of viral infection and reproduction, we will focus on the roles of viral envelopes and on the functioning of RNA as the genetic material of many viruses.

An animal virus equipped with an outer membrane, or viral envelope, uses it to enter the host cell (FIGURE 18.6). This membrane is generally a lipid bilayer, like a cellular membrane, with glycoproteins protruding from the outer surface. The glycoprotein spikes bind to specific receptor molecules on the surface of a host cell. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's plasma membrane, transporting the capsid and viral genome into the cell. After cellular enzymes remove the capsid, the viral genome can replicate and direct the synthesis of viral proteins, including glycoproteins for new viral envelopes. The endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell makes these glycoproteins, which in most cases are transported to the plasma membrane. There they are clustered in patches that serve as exit points for the viral progeny. The new viruses bud from the cell surface at these points, in a process much like exocytosis, wrapping themselves in membrane as they go. In other words, the viral envelope is derived from the host cell's plasma membrane, although some of the molecules of this membrane are specified by viral genes. The enveloped viruses are now free to spread the infection to other cells. This reproductive cycle does not necessarily kill the host cell, in contrast to the lytic cycles of phages.

		 Glycoproteins on the viral envelope recognize and bind to specific receptor molecules (not shown) on the surface of the host cell. 
			  
		 The viral envelope fuses with the cell's plasma membrane, and the capsid and viral genome enter the cell. 
			  
		 Cellular enzymes remove the capsid. 
			  
		 The viral genome functions as a template for making complementary RNA strands (lighter color), which have two functions: 
			  
		 They serve as templates for making new copies of genome RNA, and 
			  
		 they serve as mRNA. The mRNA is translated into both capsid proteins and glycoproteins for the viral envelope. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) synthesizes the glycoproteins. 
			  
		 Vesicles transport the glycoproteins to the cell's plasma membrane. 
			  
		 A capsid assembles around each viral genome molecule. 
			  
		 The virus buds from the cell. Its envelope, studded with viral glycoproteins, is derived from the cell's plasma membrane.

Some viruses have envelopes that are not derived from plasma membrane. Herpesviruses, for example, have envelopes derived from the nuclear membrane of the host. The genomes of herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA, and these viruses reproduce within the cell nucleus, using a combination of viral and cellular enzymes to replicate and transcribe their DNA. While within the nucleus, herpesvirus DNA may become integrated into the cell's genome as a provirus, similar to a bacterial prophage. Once acquired, herpes infections (which may cause cold sores or genital sores, for instance) tend to recur throughout a person's life. Between these episodes, the virus apparently remains latent within the host cells' nuclei. From time to time, physical or emotional stress may cause the herpes proviruses to leave the host's genome and initiate active virus production, resulting in the blisters of active infections.

RNA as Viral Genetic Material. Although some phages and most plant viruses are RNA viruses, the broadest variety of RNA genomes is found among the viruses that infect animals. As TABLE 18.1 indicates, RNA viruses are classified according to the strandedness of their RNA and how it functions in a host cell. Notice that there are three types of single-stranded RNA genomes (classes IV-VI). The genome of class IV viruses can directly serve as mRNA and thus can be translated into viral protein immediately after infection. (How do you suppose new RNA genomes are made?) FIGURE 18.6 shows a virus of class V, in which the RNA genome serves as a template for mRNA synthesis. The RNA genome is transcribed into a strand of complementary RNA, which serves both as mRNA and as template for the synthesis of additional copies of genome RNA. Like all viruses that require RNA  RNA synthesis to make mRNA, this one uses a viral enzyme that is packaged with the genome inside the capsid.

The RNA viruses with the most complicated reproductive cycles are the retroviruses (class VI). Retro, meaning "backward," refers to the reverse direction in which genetic information flows for these viruses. Retroviruses are equipped with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which transcribes DNA from an RNA template, providing an RNA  DNA information flow. The newly made DNA then integrates as a provirus into a chromosome within the nucleus of the animal cell. The host's RNA polymerase transcribes the viral DNA into RNA molecules, which can function both as mRNA for the synthesis of viral proteins and as genomes for new virus particles released from the cell. A retrovirus of particular importance is HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). FIGURE 18.7a (p. 336) shows the structure of HIV, and FIGURE 18.7b traces its reproductive cycle, which is typical of a retrovirus. We will postpone a detailed discussion of AIDS until Chapter 43.

Causes and Prevention of Viral Diseases in Animals

The link between a viral infection and the symptoms it produces is often obscure. Some viruses damage or kill cells by causing the release of hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes. Some viruses cause the infected cells to produce toxins that lead to disease symptoms, and some have molecular components that are toxic, such as envelope proteins. How much damage a virus causes depends partly on the ability of the infected tissue to regenerate by cell division. We usually recover completely from colds because the epithelium of the respiratory tract, which the viruses infect, can efficiently repair itself. In contrast, the poliovirus attacks nerve cells, which do not divide and cannot be replaced. Polio's damage to such cells, unfortunately, is permanent. Many of the temporary symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever, aches, and inflammation, actually result from the body's own efforts at defending itself against the infection.

As we will see in Chapter 43, the immune system is a complex and critical part of the body's natural defense mechanisms. The immune system is also the basis for the major medical weapon for preventing viral infections--vaccines. Vaccines are harmless variants or derivatives of pathogenic microbes that stimulate the immune system to mount defenses against the actual pathogen.

The term vaccine is derived from vacca, the Latin word for cow; the first vaccine, against smallpox, consisted of cowpox virus. In the late 1700s, Edward Jenner, an English physician, learned from his patients in farm country that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox (a milder disease, which usually infects cows) were resistant to subsequent smallpox infections. In his famous experiment in 1796, Jenner scratched a farmboy with a needle bearing fluid from a sore of a milkmaid who had cowpox. When the boy was later exposed to smallpox, he resisted the disease.

The cowpox and smallpox viruses are so similar that the immune system cannot distinguish them. Vaccination with the cowpox virus sensitizes the immune system to react vigorously if it is ever exposed to actual smallpox virus. Vaccination has eradicated smallpox, which was once a devastating scourge in many parts of the world. Effective vaccines have also been developed against many other viral diseases, including polio, rubella, measles, mumps, and hepatitis B.

Although vaccines can prevent certain viral illnesses, medical technology can do little, at present, to cure most viral infections once they occur. The antibiotics that help us recover from bacterial infections are powerless against viruses. Antibiotics kill bacteria by inhibiting enzymes or processes specific to the pathogens, but viruses have few or no enzymes of their own. However, a few drugs have been found that do combat viruses, mostly by interfering with viral nucleic acid synthesis. One such drug is AZT, which inhibits HIV reproduction by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase. Another is acyclovir, which inhibits herpesvirus DNA synthesis.

Emerging Viruses

HIV, the AIDS virus, seemed to make a sudden appearance in the early 1980s. In 1993, dozens of people in the southwestern United States died from hantavirus infection, which the news media first described as a "new" disease. The deadly Ebola virus (FIGURE 18.8a) has menaced the peoples of central Africa periodically since its initial recognition in 1976. The Ebola virus is only one of several recently recognized viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever, an often fatal syndrome characterized by fever, vomiting, massive bleeding, and circulatory system collapse. A number of other dangerous new viruses cause encephalitis, inflammation of the brain. One example is the Nipah virus, which in 1999 killed 105 people in Malaysia and destroyed the country's pig industry. And each year, new strains of influenza virus cause millions to miss work or classes, and deaths from flu are not uncommon. From where or what do these and other "emerging viruses" arise?

Fig 18-8. Emerging viruses. The term emerging viruses is used for viruses that have recently appeared or recently come to the attention of medical scientists. These colorized TEMs show two such viruses.

Three processes contribute to the emergence of viral diseases. First, the mutation of existing viruses is a major source of new viral diseases. RNA viruses tend to have an unusually high rate of mutation because the replication of their nucleic acid does not involve the proofreading steps of DNA replication. Some mutations enable existing viruses to evolve into new genetic varieties that can cause disease in individuals who had developed immunity to the ancestral virus. Flu epidemics are caused by viruses that are genetically different enough from earlier years' viruses that people have little immunity to them.

Another source of new viral diseases is the spread of existing viruses from one host species to another. Scientists estimate that about three-quarters of new human diseases have originated in other animals. For example, hantavirus (FIGURE 18.8b) is common in rodents, especially deer mice. The population of deer mice in the southwestern United States exploded in 1993 after unusually wet weather increased the rodents' food supply. Humans acquired hantavirus when they inhaled dust containing traces of urine and feces from infected mice.

Finally, the dissemination of a viral disease from a small, isolated population can lead to widespread epidemics. AIDS, for example, went unnamed and virtually unnoticed for decades before it began to spread around the world. In this case, technological and social factors, including affordable international travel, blood transfusion technology, sexual promiscuity, and the abuse of intravenous drugs, allowed a previously rare human disease to become a global scourge.

Thus, emerging viruses are generally not new, but are existing viruses that expand their host territory by evolving, by spreading to new host species, or by disseminating more widely in the current host species. Environmental change can increase the viral traffic responsible for emerging diseases. For example, new roads through remote areas can allow viruses to spread between previously isolated human populations. Another problem is the destruction of forests to expand crop land, an environmental disturbance that brings humans into contact with other animals that may host viruses capable of infecting humans.

Viruses and Cancer

Since 1911, when Peyton Rous discovered a virus that causes cancer in chickens, scientists have recognized that some viruses can cause cancer in animals. We know that these tumor viruses include members of the retrovirus, papovavirus, ade-no-virus, and herpesvirus groups (see TABLE 18.1).

There is strong evidence that viruses cause certain types of human cancer. The virus responsible for hepatitis B also seems to cause liver cancer in individuals with chronic hepatitis. And the Epstein-Barr virus, the herpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis, has been linked to several types of cancer prevalent in parts of Africa, notably Burkitt's lymphoma. Pap-illoma viruses (of the papovavirus group) have been associated with cancer of the cervix. Among the retroviruses, one called HTLV-1 causes a type of adult leukemia. All tumor viruses transform cells into cancer cells through the integration of viral nucleic acid into host cell DNA.

Scientists have identified a number of viral genes directly involved in triggering cancerous characteristics in cells. Many of these genes, called oncogenes, are not unique to tumor viruses or tumor cells; versions of these genes, called proto-oncogenes, are also found in normal cells. Proto-oncogenes generally code for proteins that affect the cell cycle, such as growth factors and proteins involved in growth factor action (for example, growth factor receptors). In some cases, the tumor virus lacks oncogenes and transforms the cell simply by turning on or increasing the expression of one or more of the cell's proto-oncogenes. Whatever the mechanism by which a particular virus causes cancer, there is evidence that more than one change must occur in a cell's genome to transform the cell into a fully cancerous state. It is likely that most tumor viruses cause cancer only in combination with other, mutagenic events, such as exposure to mutagens or mistakes in DNA replication or repair. (Cancer is covered further in Chapter 19.)





 Plant viruses are serious agricultural pests

Plant viruses can stunt plant growth and diminish crop yields (FIGURE 18.9a). Most plant viruses discovered thus far are RNA viruses. Many of them, including the tobacco mosaic virus, have rod-shaped capsids with protein arranged in a spiral (see FIGURE 18.2a).

There are two major routes by which a plant viral disease can spread. By the first route, called horizontal transmission, a plant is infected from an external source of the virus. Since the invading virus must get past the plant's outer protective layer of cells (the epidermis), the plant becomes more susceptible to viral infections if it has been damaged by wind, chilling, injury, or insects. Insects are a double threat, because they often also act as carriers of viruses, transmitting disease from plant to plant. Farmers and gardeners may transmit plant viruses inadvertently on pruning shears and other tools. The other route of viral infection is vertical transmission, in which a plant inherits a viral infection from a parent. Vertical transmission can occur in asexual propagation (for example, by taking cuttings) or in sexual reproduction via infected seeds.

Once a virus enters a plant cell and begins reproducing, virus particles can spread throughout the plant by passing through plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic connections that penetrate the walls between adjacent plant cells (FIGURE 18.9b). Agricultural scientists have not yet devised cures for most viral diseases of plants. Therefore, their efforts have focused largely on reducing the incidence and transmission of such diseases and on breeding genetic varieties of crop plants that are relatively resistant to certain viruses.





 Viroids and prions are infectious agents even simpler than viruses

As small and simple as viruses are, they dwarf another class of pathogens, viroids. These are tiny molecules of naked circular RNA that infect plants. Only several hundred nucleotides long, viroids do not encode proteins but can replicate in host plant cells, apparently using cellular enzymes. Somehow, these RNA molecules can disrupt the metabolism of a plant cell and stunt the growth of the whole plant. One viroid disease has killed over 10 million coconut palms in the Philippines. Viroids seem to cause errors in the regulatory systems that control plant growth, and the symptoms that are typically associated with viroid diseases are abnormal development and stunted growth.

An important lesson from viroids is that a molecule can be an infectious agent that spreads a disease. But viroids are nucleic acid, whose ability to replicate is well known. More difficult to explain is the evidence for infectious proteins, called prions. Prions appear to cause a number of degenerative brain diseases, including scrapie in sheep, the "mad cow disease" that has plagued the European beef industry in recent years, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. How can a protein, which cannot replicate itself, be a transmissible pathogen? According to the leading hypothesis, a prion is a misfolded form of a protein normally present in brain cells. When the prion gets into a cell containing the normal form of the protein, the prion converts the normal protein to the prion version (FIGURE 18.10). In this way, prions may repeatedly trigger chain reactions that increase their numbers. American scientist Stanley Prusiner has long championed the prion hypothesis and in 1997 was awarded a Nobel Prize for his research in this area. Today, mounting evidence supports the pathogenic role of prions in animal diseases and the hypothesis depicted in FIGURE 18.10.

Fig 18-10. A hypothesis to explain how prions propagate. Prions are misfolded versions of normal brain proteins. When a prion contacts a normal "twin," it may induce the normal protein to assume the abnormal shape. The resulting chain reaction may continue until prions accumulate to dangerous levels, causing cellular malfunction and eventual degeneration of the brain.





 Viruses may have evolved from other mobile genetic elements

Viruses are in the semantic fog between life and nonlife. Do we think of them as nature's most complex molecules or as the simplest forms of life? Either way, we must bend our usual definitions. An isolated virus is biologically inert, unable to replicate its genes or regenerate its own supply of ATP. Yet it has a genetic program written in the universal language of life. Although viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that cannot reproduce independently, it is hard to deny their evolutionary connection to the living world.

How did viruses originate? Because they depend on cells for their own propagation, it is reasonable to assume that viruses are not the descendants of precellular prototypes of life, but evolved after the first cells appeared. Most molecular biologists favor the hypothesis that viruses originated from fragments of cellular nucleic acids that could move from one cell to another. Consistent with this idea is the observation that a viral genome usually has more in common with the genome of its host than with the genomes of viruses infecting other hosts. Indeed, some viral genes are essentially identical to genes of the host, as in the case of oncogenes, for example. Perhaps the earliest viruses were naked bits of nucleic acid, similar to plant viroids, that made it from one cell to another via injured cell surfaces. The evolution of genes coding for capsid proteins may have facilitated the infection of undamaged cells.

Candidates for the original sources of viral genomes include two kinds of cellular genetic elements, plasmids and transposons. Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that are separate from chromosomes. They are found in bacteria and also in yeasts, which are unicellular eukaryotes. Plasmids, like most viruses, can replicate independently of the rest of the cell's genome and are occasionally transferred between cells. Transposons are DNA segments that can move from one location to another within a cell's genome. Thus, plasmids, transposons, and viruses all share an important feature: They are mobile genetic elements. (We will discuss plasmids and transposons in more detail later in the chapter.)

It is the evolutionary relationship between viruses and the genomes of their host cells that makes viruses such useful model systems in molecular biology. By studying how the replication of viruses is controlled, researchers are learning more about the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication and gene expression (transcription and translation) in cells. Bacteria are equally valuable as microbial models in genetics research, but for different reasons. Unlike viruses, bacteria are true cells. But as prokaryotic cells, bacteria provide researchers with the opportunity to investigate molecular genetics in the simplest organisms. In fact, E. coli, the bacterium sometimes called "the laboratory rat of molecular biology," is the most completely understood of all organisms at the molecular level. Let's now learn more about the genetics of bacteria.





 Genetic recombination produces new bacterial strains

Natural selection depends on heritable variation among the individuals of a population (see Chapter 1). In addition to mutations, genetic recombination generates diversity within bacterial populations. We will define recombination here simply as the combining of DNA from two individuals into the genome of a single individual.

How can we detect genetic recombination in bacteria? Consider two mutant E. coli strains (genetic varieties), each unable to synthesize one of its required amino acids. Wild-type E. coli can grow on a minimal medium containing only glucose, as a source of organic carbon, and salts. The mutant strains cannot grow on this culture medium of minimal nutrients because one of them cannot synthesize tryptophan and the other cannot synthesize arginine (FIGURE 18.12).

Fig 18-12. Detecting genetic recombination in bacteria. Each of the two mutant strains of E. coli in this experiment is unable to synthesize a particular amino acid, either arginine or tryptophan. These mutant bacteria cannot reproduce on minimal medium (MM), which is simply a solution of glucose and salts. But after bacteria of the two mutant strains are incubated together, some cells from the mixed culture are able to grow into colonies on a plate containing minimal medium solidified with agar. Those cells are recombinant bacteria: arg+trp+ cells produced by gene transfer between cells of the two mutant types. (You will learn about the mechanism in FIGURE 18.15c and d.)

Let's suppose we mix bacteria from the two strains together in a liquid medium and allow them to incubate for an hour or so. We then spread a small sample of this culture on solid (agar-thickened) minimal medium in a petri dish and incubate the dish overnight. The next morning we observe numerous colonies of bacteria on the minimal medium. Each of these colonies must have started with a cell capable of making both tryptophan and arginine, but their number far exceeds what can be accounted for by mutation. Most of the cells that can synthesize both amino acids must have acquired one or more genes from the other strain. This is evidence that genetic recombination has occurred.

Bacteria are different from eukaryotes in the ways DNA from two individuals can come together in one cell. In eukaryotes, the sexual processes of meiosis and fertilization combine DNA from two individuals in a single zygote (see Chapter 13). But sex, as defined in eukaryotes, is absent in prokaryotes: Meiosis and fertilization do not occur. Instead, other processes bring together bacterial DNA from different individuals. These processes are transformation, transduction, and conjugation.

Transformation

In the context of bacterial genetics, transformation is the alteration of a bacterial cell's genotype by the uptake of naked, foreign DNA from the surrounding environment. For example, we saw in Chapter 16 that harmless Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria could be transformed to pneumonia-causing cells by the uptake of naked DNA from a medium containing dead, broken-open cells of the pathogenic strain. This transformation occurs when a live nonpathogenic cell takes up a piece of DNA that happens to include the allele for pathogenicity (the gene for a cell coat that protects the bacterium from a host's immune system). The foreign allele is then incorporated into the bacterial chromosome, replacing the native allele (for the "coatless" condition, in this case). The process is genetic recombination--an exchange of DNA segments by crossing over. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells.

For many years after transformation was discovered in laboratory cultures, most biologists believed the process to be too rare and haphazard to play an important role in natural bacterial populations. But researchers have since learned that many bacterial species possess on their surfaces proteins that are specialized for the uptake of naked DNA from the surrounding solution. These proteins specifically recognize and transport only DNA from closely related species of bacteria. Not all bacteria have such membrane proteins. For instance, E. coli does not seem to have any specialized mechanism for the uptake of foreign DNA. However, placing E. coli in a culture medium containing a relatively high concentration of calcium ions will artificially stimulate the cells to take up small pieces of DNA. In biotechnology, this technique is applied to introduce foreign genes into E. coli--genes coding for valuable proteins, such as human insulin and growth hormone.

Transduction

In the DNA transfer process known as transduction, phages (the viruses that infect bacteria) carry bacterial genes from one host cell to another. There are two forms of transduction: generalized transduction and specialized transduction. Both result from aberrations in phage reproductive cycles.

First let's consider generalized transduction, shown on the left side of FIGURE 18.13. Recall that near the end of a phage's lytic cycle, viral nucleic acid molecules are packaged within capsids, and the completed phages are released when the host cell lyses. Occasionally, a small piece of the host cell's degraded DNA is accidentally packaged within a phage capsid in place of the phage genome. Such a virus is defective because it lacks its own genetic material. However, after its release from the lysed host, the phage can attach to another bacterium and inject the piece of bacterial DNA acquired from the first cell. Some of this DNA can subsequently replace the homologous region of the second cell's chromosome. The cell's chromosome now has a combination of DNA derived from two cells; genetic recombination has occurred. This type of transduction is called generalized transduction because the phage transfers bacterial genes at random.

Fig 18-13. Transduction. Phages occasionally carry bacterial genes from one cell to another. In generalized transduction (left), random pieces of the host chromosome are packaged within a phage capsid. In specialized transduction (right), a prophage exits the chromosome in such a way that it carries adjacent bacterial genes along with it. In both types of transduction, the transferred DNA may recombine with the genome of the new host cell.

Let's contrast this process with specialized transduction, shown on the right side of FIGURE 18.13. This form of transduction requires infection by a temperate phage. Recall that in the lysogenic cycle, the genome of a temperate phage integrates as a prophage into the host bacterium's chromosome, usually at a specific site. Later, when the phage genome is excised from the chromosome, it sometimes takes with it a small region of the bacterial DNA that was adjacent to the prophage. When such a virus carrying bacterial DNA infects another host cell, the bacterial genes are injected along with the phage's genome. Specialized transduction transfers only certain genes, those near the prophage site on the bacterial chromosome.

Conjugation and Plasmids

Conjugation is the direct transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells that are temporarily joined. This process, the bacterial version of sex, has been studied most extensively in E. coli. The DNA transfer is one-way: one cell donating DNA, and its "mate" receiving the genes. The DNA donor, referred to informally as the "male," uses appendages called sex pili to attach to the DNA recipient, the "female" (FIGURE 18.14). A sex pilus acts like a grappling hook: After contacting a female cell, it retracts, pulling the two cells together. A temporary cytoplasmic bridge then forms between the two cells, providing an avenue for DNA transfer. In most cases, "maleness," the ability to form sex pili and donate DNA during conjugation, results from the presence of a special piece of DNA called an F factor (F for fertility). An F factor can exist either as a segment of DNA within the bacterial chromosome or as a plasmid. Before discussing the role of the F factor in conjugation, we should examine plasmids more generally.

Fig 18-14. Bacterial mating. The E. coli"male" (right) extends sex pili, one of which is attached to a "female" cell. The two cells will be drawn close together, allowing a cytoplasmic bridge to form between them. Through this tube, the "male" will transfer DNA to the "female." This mechanism of DNA transfer is called conjugation (colorized TEM).

General Characteristics of Plasmids. A plasmid is a small, circular, self-replicating DNA molecule separate from the bacterial chromosome. Certain plasmids, such as F plasmids, can undergo reversible incorporation into the cell's chromosome. A genetic element that can exist either as a plasmid or as part of the bacterial chromosome is called an episome. In addition to some plasmids, temperate viruses, such as phage l, also qualify as episomes. Recall that the genomes of these phages replicate independently during a lytic cycle and as an integral part of the bacterial chromosome during a lysogenic cycle. Of course, there are important differences between plasmids and viruses. Plasmids, unlike viruses, lack protein coats and do not normally exist outside the cell. And plasmids are generally beneficial to the bacterial cell, while viruses are parasites that usually harm their hosts.

A plasmid has only a small number of genes, and these genes are not required for the survival and reproduction of the bacterium under normal conditions. However, the genes of plasmids can confer advantages on bacteria living in stressful environments. For example, the F plasmid facilitates genetic recombination, which may be advantageous in a changing environment that no longer favors existing strains in a bacterial population.

The F Plasmid and Conjugation. The F factor and its plasmid form, the F plasmid, consist of about 25 genes, most required for the production of sex pili. Geneticists use the symbol F+ to denote a cell that contains the F plasmid (a "male" cell). The F+ condition is heritable: The F plasmid replicates in synchrony with the chromosomal DNA, and division of an F+ cell usually gives rise to two offspring that are both F+. Cells lacking the F factor in either form are designated F-, and they function as DNA recipients ("females") during conjugation. The F+ condition is "contagious" in the sense that an F+ cell converts an F- cell to F+ when the two cells conjugate. The original F+ cell remains F+ because the F plasmid replicates within the "male" cell, and only one copy of the plasmid is transferred to the "female" through the conjugation tube joining the cells (FIGURE 18.15a, p. 344). In an F+&#160;X&#160; F- mating, only an F plasmid is transferred.

Fig 18-15. Conjugation and recombination in E. coli. The DNA replication that accompanies transfer of an F plasmid or part of an Hfr bacterial chromosome is called rolling-circle replication.

Under what circumstances are genes of the bacterial chromosome transferred during conjugation? This can occur when the donor cell's F factor is integrated into the chromosome (FIGURE 18.15b). A cell with the F factor built into its chromosome is called an Hfr cell (for high frequency of recombination). Like an F+ cell, an Hfr cell functions as a male during conjugation: It initiates DNA replication at a point on the F factor DNA and from that point starts to transfer the DNA copy to its F- partner. But now, the leading end of the F factor is dragging a copy of chromosomal DNA along with it (FIGURE 18.15c). Random movements of the bacteria almost always disrupt conjugation long before an entire copy of the Hfr chromosome can be passed to the F- cell. Temporarily, the recipient cell is a partial diploid, containing its own chromosome plus DNA copied from part of the donor's chromosome. Then recombination can occur: If part of the newly acquired DNA aligns with the homologous region of the F- chromosome, segments of DNA can be exchanged (FIGURE 18.15d). Binary fission of this cell gives rise to a colony of recombinant bacteria with genes derived from two different cells. (This is what happened in the experiment in FIGURE 18.12, where one of the bacterial strains was an Hfr and the other an F-.)

R Plasmids and Antibiotic Resistance. In the 1950s, Japanese physicians began to notice that some hospital patients suffering from bacterial dysentery, which produces severe diarrhea, did not respond to antibiotics that had generally been effective in treating this type of infection. Apparently, re-sis-tance to these antibiotics had evolved in certain strains of Shigella, the pathogen. Eventually, researchers began to identify the specific genes that confer antibiotic resistance in Shigella and other pathogenic bacteria. Some of these genes, for example, code for enzymes that specifically destroy certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline or ampicillin. The genes conferring resistance, it turns out, are carried by plasmids, now known as R plasmids (R for resistance).

Exposure of a bacterial population to a specific antibiotic, whether in a laboratory culture or within a host organism, will kill antibiotic-sensitive bacteria but not those that happen to have R plasmids that counter that antibiotic. The theory of natural selection predicts that under these circumstances, the fraction of the bacterial population carrying genes for anti-biotic resistance will increase, and that is exactly what happens. The medical consequences are also predictable: Resistant strains of pathogens are becoming more common, making the treatment of certain bacterial infections more difficult. The problem is compounded by the fact that R plasmids, like F plasmids, have genes that encode sex pili and enable plasmid transfer from one bacterial cell to another by conjugation. Making the problem still worse, some R plasmids carry as many as ten genes for resistance to that many antibiotics. How do so many antibiotic resistance genes become part of a single plasmid? The answer involves another type of mobile genetic element, called a transposon, which we investigate next.

Transposons

A transposon, also called a transposable genetic element, is a piece of DNA that can move from one location to another in a cell's genome. Unlike an episome or prophage, transposons never exist independently. Instead, transposon movement (transposition) occurs as a type of recombination between the transposon and another DNA site--a target site--that comes in contact with the transposon. In a bacterial cell, a transposon may move within the chromosome, from a plasmid to the chromosome (or vice versa), or from one plasmid to another. Transposons bring multiple genes for antibiotic resistance into a single R plasmid by moving the genes to that location from different plasmids.

Transposons are sometimes called "jumping genes," but the phrase is slightly misleading. Some transposons do jump from one genomic location to another, in what is called cut-and-paste transposition. However, in another type of transposition, called replicative transposition, the transposon replicates at its original site, and a copy inserts elsewhere; that is, the transposon is added at some new site without being lost from the old site.

Although transposons vary in their selectivity for target sites, most can move to many alternative locations in the DNA. This ability to scatter certain genes throughout the genome makes transposition fundamentally different from other mechanisms of genetic shuffling. The genetic recombination that occurs in bacterial transformation, generalized transduction, and conjugation (and during meiosis in eukaryotes as well) depends on base pairing between homologous regions of DNA, regions of identical or very similar base sequence. In contrast, the insertion of a transposon in a new site does not depend on complementary base sequences. A transposon can move genes to a site where genes of that sort have never before existed.

Insertion Sequences. The simplest bacterial transposons are insertion sequences. They consist of only the DNA necessary for the act of transposition. The one gene found in an insertion sequence codes for a transposase, an enzyme that catalyzes movement of the transposon from one location to another within the genome. The transposase gene is bracketed by a pair of DNA sequences called inverted repeats, noncoding sequences about 20 to 40 nucleotides long. Notice in FIGURE 18.16 that each base sequence is repeated in reverse along the opposite DNA strand of the inverted repeat at the other end of the transposon. Transposase recognizes these inverted repeats as the boundaries of the transposon. During transposition, molecules of the enzyme bind to the inverted repeats and to a target site elsewhere in the genome and catalyze the DNA cutting and resealing required for transposition. Other enzymes also participate in transposition. For example, DNA polymerase helps create identical regions of DNA, called direct repeats, that flank a transposon in its new site (FIGURE 18.17, p. 346).

Fig 18-16. Insertion sequences, the simplest transposons. The one gene of an insertion sequence codes for transposase, which catalyzes the transposon's movement. The inverted repeats, about 20 to 40 nucleotide pairs long, are backward, upside-down versions of each other. In transposition, transposase molecules bind to the inverted repeats and catalyze the cutting and resealing of DNA required for insertion of the transposon at a target site. This diagram and the ones that follow are not to scale.

Fig 18-17. Insertion of a transposon and creation of direct repeats. 
			  
		 First, the transposase enzyme makes staggered cuts (red arrows) in the two DNA strands at a target site, leaving short segments of unpaired DNA as shown. Meanwhile, the transposon is cut out or copied at its initial site. 
			  
		 The transposon is then joined to the single-stranded ends at the target site. Presumably, the transposase holds all the components together during this process. 
			  
		 Finally, the gaps in the DNA strands are filled in by DNA polymerase and sealed by ligase. This results in direct repeats, identical segments of DNA on either side of the transposon. (Distances along the DNA are not to scale).

Insertion sequences cause mutations when they happen to land within the coding sequence of a gene or within a DNA region that regulates gene expression. But notice that this mechanism of mutation is intrinsic to the cell, in contrast to mutagenesis by extrinsic factors such as environmental radiation and chemicals. Insertion sequences account for about 1.5%  of the E. coli genome. However, mutation of a given gene by transposition occurs only rarely--about once in every 10 million generations. This is about the same as the spontaneous mutation rate due to other factors.

Composite Transposons. Transposons longer and more complex than insertion sequences also move about in the bacterial genome. In addition to the DNA required for transposition, these composite transposons (also called complex transposons) include extra genes that go along for the ride, such as genes for antibiotic resistance. The extra genes are sandwiched between two insertion sequences (FIGURE 18.18). It is as though two insertion sequences happened to land relatively close together in the genome and now travel together, along with all the DNA between them, as a single transposon. As is characteristic of transposons, there is an inverted repeat and a direct repeat at each end. (The direct repeat is not considered part of the transposon, however.)

Fig 18-18. Anatomy of a composite transposon. A composite transposon consists of one or more genes located between twin insertion sequences. The transposon here has a gene for resistance to an antibiotic, which is carried along as part of the transposon when the transposon is inserted at a new site in the genome.

In contrast to insertion sequences, which are not known to benefit bacteria in any specific way, composite transposons may help bacteria adapt to new environments. We mentioned earlier that a single R plasmid can carry several genes for resistance to different antibiotics. This is explained by composite transposons, which can add a gene for antibiotic resistance to a plasmid already carrying genes for resistance to other antibiotics. The transmission of this composite plasmid to other bacterial cells by cell division or conjugation can then spread resistance to a variety of antibiotics throughout a bacterial population. In an antibiotic-rich environment, natural selection favors bacterial clones that have built up composite R plasmids through a series of transpositions.

Transposable genetic elements are not unique to bacteria, but are important components of eukaryotic genomes as well. In fact, the first evidence for such wandering DNA segments came from the American geneticist Barbara McClintock's breeding experiments with Indian corn (maize) in the 1940s and 1950s. McClintock identified changes in the color of corn kernels that made sense only if she postulated the existence of mobile genetic elements capable of moving from other locations in the genome to the genes for kernel color. She called these mobile elements "controlling -elements" because they seemed to insert next to the genes responsible for kernel color, either activating or inactivating those genes. McClintock's discovery received little attention until transposons were discovered in bacteria many years later and microbial geneticists learned more about the molecular basis of transposition. In 1983, more than 30 years after she discovered transposable genetic elements, Barbara McClintock was awarded a Nobel Prize, at age 81. McClintock continued her experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York until her death in 1992.

You will learn more about transposons in eukaryotes in Chapter 19. We end this Chapter by examining how bacterial genes are regulated in different environments.





 The control of gene expression enables individual bacteria to adjust their metabolism to environmental change

Mutations and the various types of genetic transfer we have been studying generate the genetic variation that makes natural selection possible. And natural selection, acting over many generations, can increase the proportion of individuals in a bacterial population that are adapted to some new environmental condition. But how can an individual bacterium, locked into the genome it has inherited, cope with environmental fluctuation?

Think, for instance, of an E. coli cell living in the erratic environment of a human colon, dependent for its nutrients on the whimsical eating habits of its host. If the bacterium is deprived of the amino acid tryptophan, which it needs to survive, it responds by activating a metabolic pathway to make its own tryptophan from another compound. Later, if the human host eats a tryptophan-rich meal, the bacterial cell stops producing tryptophan for itself, thus saving the cell from squandering its resources to produce a substance that is available from the surrounding solution in prefabricated form. This is just one example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to changing environments.

Metabolic control occurs on two levels (FIGURE 18.19). First, cells can vary the numbers of specific enzyme molecules made; that is, they can regulate the expression of genes. Second, cells can adjust the activity of enzymes already present. The latter mode of control, which is more immediate, depends on the sensitivity of many enzymes to chemical cues that increase or decrease their catalytic activity (see Chapter 6). For example, activity of the first enzyme of the tryptophan synthesis pathway is inhibited by the pathway's end product. Thus, if tryptophan accumulates in a cell, it shuts down its own synthesis. Such feedback inhibition, typical of anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways, allows a cell to adapt to short-term fluctuations in levels of a substance it needs.

Fig 18-19. Regulation of a metabolic pathway. In the pathway for tryptophan synthesis, an abundance of tryptophan can both (a) repress expression of the genes for all the enzymes needed for the pathway, and (b) inhibit the activity of the first enzyme in the pathway (feedback inhibition). The symbol  stands for "inhibition."

If, in our example, the environment continues to provide all the tryptophan the cell needs, the regulation of gene expression also comes into play: The cell stops making enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. This control of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcription, the synthesis of messenger RNA coding for these enzymes. More generally, many genes of the bacterial genome are switched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the cell. The basic mechanism for this control of gene expression in bacteria, described as the operon model, was discovered in 1961 by Franois Jacob and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Let's see what an operon is and how it works, using the control of tryptophan synthesis as our first example.

Operons: The Basic Concept

E. coli synthesizes tryptophan from a precursor molecule in a series of steps, each reaction catalyzed by a specific enzyme (see FIGURE 18.19). The five genes coding for the polypeptide chains that make up these enzymes are clustered together on the bacterial chromosome. A single promoter serves all five genes, which constitute a transcription unit. (Recall from Chapter 17 that a promoter is a site where RNA polymerase can bind to DNA and begin transcribing genes.) Thus, transcription gives rise to one long mRNA molecule representing all five genes for the tryptophan pathway. The cell can translate this transcript into separate polypeptides because the mRNA is punctuated with start and stop codons signaling where the coding sequence for each polypeptide begins and ends.

A key advantage of grouping genes of related function into one transcription unit is that a single "on-off switch" can control the whole cluster of functionally related genes. When an E. coli cell must make tryptophan for itself because the nutrient medium lacks this amino acid, all the enzymes for the metabolic pathway are synthesized at one time. The switch is a segment of DNA called an operator. Both its location and name suit its function: Positioned within the promoter or between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes, the operator controls the access of RNA polymerase to the genes. All together, the operator, the promoter, and the genes they control--the entire stretch of DNA required for enzyme production for the tryptophan pathway--is called an operon (FIGURE 18.20). Here we are dissecting one of many operons that have been discovered in E. coli: the trp operon (trp for tryptophan).

Fig 18-20. The trp operon: regulated synthesis of repressible enzymes. Tryptophan is an amino acid produced by an anabolic path-way catalyzed by repressible enzymes. Five genes encoding the polypeptides that make up the enzymes of this pathway are grouped into an operon, along with a promoter and an operator. (The trp operator is located within the trp promoter.) Accumulation of tryptophan, the end product of the pathway, represses synthesis of the enzymes. The mechanism in E. coli is shown here.

If the operator is the control point for transcription, what determines whether the operator is in the on or off mode? By itself, the operator is on; RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes of the operon. The operon can be switched off by a protein called the repressor. The repressor binds to the operator and blocks attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, preventing transcription of the genes. Repressor proteins are specific; that is, they recognize and bind only to the operator of a certain operon. The repressor that switches off the trp operon has no effect on other operons in the E. coli genome.

The repressor is the product of a gene called a regulatory gene. The regulatory gene encoding the trp repressor, trpR, is located some distance away from the operon it controls and has its own promoter. Transcription of trpR produces an mRNA molecule that is translated into the repressor protein, which can then reach the operator of the trp operon by diffusion. Regulatory genes are transcribed continuously, although at a low rate, and a few trp repressor molecules are always present in the cell. Why, then, is the trp operon not switched off permanently? First, the binding of repressors to operators is reversible. An operator vacillates between the on and off modes, with the relative duration of each state depending on the number of active repressor molecules around. Secondly, the trp repressor, like most regulatory proteins, is an allosteric protein, with two alternative shapes, active and inactive (see FIGURE 6.18). The trp repressor is synthesized in an inactive form with little affinity for the trp operator. Only if tryptophan binds to the repressor at an allosteric site does the repressor protein change to the active form that can attach to the operator, turning the operon off.

Tryptophan functions in this system as a corepressor, a small molecule that cooperates with a repressor protein to switch an operon off. As tryptophan accumulates, more tryptophan molecules associate with trp repressor molecules, which can then bind to the trp operator and shut down tryptophan production. If the cell's tryptophan level drops, transcription of the operon's genes resumes. This is one example of how gene expression responds rapidly to changes in the cell's internal and external environment.

Repressible Versus Inducible Operons: Two Types of Negative Gene Regulation

The trp operon is said to be a repressible operon because its transcription is inhibited when a specific small molecule (tryptophan) binds allosterically to a regulatory protein. In contrast, an inducible operon is stimulated (that is, induced) when a specific small molecule interacts with a regulatory protein. Let's investigate an example, which was actually the operon first worked out by Jacob and Monod (FIGURE 18.21).

Fig 18-21. The lac operon: regulated synthesis of inducible enzymes. E. coli uses three enzymes to take up and metabolize lactose. The genes for these three enzymes are clustered in the lac operon. One gene, lacZ, codes for b-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose. The second gene, lacY, codes for a permease, the membrane protein that transports lactose into the cell. The third gene, lacA, codes for an enzyme called transacetylase, whose function in lactose metabolism is still unclear. The gene for the lac repressor, lacI, happens to be adjacent to the lac operon, an unusual situation. (The function of the upstream (left) end of the promoter is revealed in FIGURE 18.22.)

The disaccharide lactose (milk sugar) is available to E. coli if the human host drinks milk. The bacteria can absorb the lactose and break it down for energy or use it as a source of organic carbon for synthesizing other compounds. Lactose metabolism begins with hydrolysis of the disaccharide into its two component monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is called b-galactosidase. Only a few molecules of this enzyme are present in an E. coli cell that has been growing in the absence of lactose--in the intestines of a person who does not drink milk, for example. But if lactose is added to the bacterium's nutrient medium, it takes only about 15 minutes for the number of b-galactosidase molecules in the cell to increase a thousandfold.

The gene for b-galactosidase is part of an operon, the lac operon (lac for lactose metabolism), that includes two other genes coding for proteins that function in lactose metabolism (see FIGURE 18.21). This entire transcription unit is under the command of a single operator and promoter. The regulatory gene, lacI, located outside the operon, codes for an allosteric repressor protein that can switch off the lac operon by binding to the operator. So far, this sounds just like regulation of the trp operon, but there is one important difference. Recall that the trp repressor was innately inactive and required tryptophan as a corepressor in order to bind to the operator. The lac repressor, in contrast, is active all by itself, binding to the operator and switching the lac operon off. In this case, a specific small molecule, called an inducer, inactivates the repressor. For the lac operon, the inducer is allolactose, an isomer of lactose formed in small amounts from lactose that enters the cell. In the absence of lactose (and hence allolactose), the lac repressor is in its active configuration, and the genes of the lac operon are silenced. If lactose is added to the cell's nutrient medium, allolactose binds to the lac repressor and alters its conformation, nullifying the repressor's ability to attach to the operator. Now, on demand, the lac operon produces mRNA for the enzymes of the lactose pathway. In the context of gene regulation, these enzymes are referred to as inducible enzymes, because their synthesis is induced by a chemical signal (allolactose, in this case). Analogously, the enzymes for tryptophan synthesis are said to be repressible.

Let's compare repressible enzymes and inducible enzymes in terms of the metabolic economy of the E. coli cell. Repressible enzymes generally function in anabolic pathways, which synthesize essential end products from raw materials (precursors). By suspending production of an end product when it is already present in sufficient quantity, the cell can allocate its organic precursors and energy for other uses. In contrast, inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways, which break a nutrient down to simpler molecules. By producing the appropriate enzymes only when the nutrient is available, the cell avoids making proteins that have nothing to do. Why bother, for example, to make the enzymes that break down milk sugar when no milk is present?

In comparing repressible and inducible enzymes, there is one more important point: Both systems are examples of the negative control of genes, because the operons are switched off by the active form of the repressor protein. It may be easier to see this in the case of the trp operon, but it is true for the lac operon as well. Allolactose induces enzyme synthesis not by acting directly on the genome, but by freeing the lac operon from the negative effect of the repressor. Technically, allolactose is more of a derepressor than an inducer of genes. Gene regulation is said to be positive only when an activator molecule interacts directly with the genome to switch transcription on. Let's look at an example, again involving the lac operon.

An Example of Positive Gene Regulation

For the enzymes that break down lactose to be synthesized in appreciable quantity, it is not enough that lactose be present in the bacterial cell. The other requirement is that the simple sugar glucose be in short supply. Given a choice of substrates for glycolysis and other catabolic pathways, E. coli preferentially uses glucose, the sugar most reliably present in its environment. The enzymes for glucose breakdown (glycolysis; see FIGURE 9.9) are continually present.

How does the E. coli cell sense the glucose concentration, and how is this information relayed to the genome? Again, the mechanism depends on the interaction of an allosteric regulatory protein with a small organic molecule. The small molecule is cyclic AMP (cAMP), which accumulates when glucose is scarce (see FIGURE 11.12 for the structure of cAMP). The regulatory protein is cAMP receptor protein (CRP), and it is an activator of transcription. When cAMP binds to the allosteric site on CRP, the protein assumes its active shape and can bind to a specific site at the upstream end of the lac promoter (FIGURE 18.22). The attachment of CRP actually bends the DNA, which somehow makes it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and start transcription of the operon. Because CRP is a regulatory protein that directly stimulates gene expression, this mechanism qualifies as positive regulation.

Fig 18-22. Positive control: cAMP receptor protein. RNA polymerase has a low affinity for the promoter of the lac operon unless helped by a regulatory protein called the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which binds to a DNA site at the upstream end of the promoter. The CRP molecule can attach to the DNA only when associated with cyclic AMP (cAMP), whose concentration in the cell rises when the glucose concentration falls. Thus, even if lactose is available, the cell preferentially catabolizes glucose, using enzymes that are always present. This regulatory system ensures that E. coli will gear up for consumption of lactose and other secondary catabolites only when glucose is scarce.

If the amount of glucose in the cell increases, the cAMP concentration falls, and without it, CRP disengages from the operon. Because CRP is inactive, transcription of the lac operon proceeds at only a low level, even in the presence of lactose. Thus, the lac operon is under dual control: negative control by the lac repressor and positive control by CRP. The state of the lac repressor (with or without allolactose) determines whether or not transcription of the lac operon's genes can occur; the state of CRP (with or without cAMP) controls the rate of transcription if the operon is repressor-free. It is as though the operon has both an on-off switch and a volume control.

Although we have used the lac operon as an example, CRP, unlike repressor proteins, works on several different operons that encode enzymes used in catabolic pathways. When glucose is present and CRP is inactive, there is a general slowdown in the synthesis of enzymes required for the catabolism of compounds other than glucose. The cell's ability to catabolize other compounds, such as lactose, provides backup systems that enable a cell deprived of glucose to survive. The specific compounds present at the moment determine which operons are switched on. These elaborate contingency mechanisms suit an organism that cannot control what its host eats. Bacteria are remarkable in their ability to adapt--over the long term by evolutionary changes in their genetic makeup and over the short term by the control of gene expression in individual cells. Of course, the various control mechanisms are also evolutionary products that exist because they have been favored by natural selection.

Molecular genetics was founded on the study of viruses and bacteria, the microbial models that have been the subjects of this chapter. Eukaryotic organisms and their genomes are much more complex, and only in the past decade or so have researchers begun to learn how the control of gene expression helps bring about this complexity. In the next chapter, we begin to explore this topic.
