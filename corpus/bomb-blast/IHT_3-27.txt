 30 die as explosion rips U.S-Iraq base

MOSUL, Iraq At least 30 people were killed in a bomb blast inside a joint U.S.- Iraq base in Mosul on Monday, police said.
 
An Interior Ministry source said the explosion targeted Iraqi Army recruits and may have been carried out by a suicide bomber strapped with explosives, but it was not immediately possible to verify this. No further details were available.
 
In December 2004 a suicide bomber wearing an Iraqi uniform blew himself up at a U.S. armed forces mess tent in Mosul, killing 21 people, among them 14 U.S. troops and four other Americans.
 
It was not immediately clear if Monday's explosion took place at the same site.
 
The blast occurred one day after at least 16 people were killed in the Mustafa mosque near Sadr City in Baghdad in what some Shiite leaders said was a massacre of worshipers by U.S. troops. Police and residents said the killings resulted from a clash between American and Shiite militiamen.
 
The U.S. military, clearly worried about exacerbating a combustible situation that many Iraqis are already describing as civil war, denied that American forces had entered the mosque. But it said in a statement that 16 insurgents had been killed and 15 captured in a nearby combat operation against a terrorist cell.
 
The differing versions of what happened seemed to raise a broader question about who is in control of Iraq's security at a time when Iraqi politicians still have not formed a unified government, sectarian tensions are higher than ever and mutilated bodies keep surfacing on the streets. On Sunday, the Iraqi authorities found 10 bodies in Baghdad and said they were investigating a report that 30 men were beheaded near Baquba.
 
American officials are now saying that Shiite militias are the No. 1 problem in Iraq, more dangerous than the Sunni- led insurgents who for nearly the past three years have been branded the gravest security threat.
 
Shiite militias have been accused of running death squads that kidnap and brutalize Sunni men, and on Sunday the American military said the cell its forces raided had kidnapped Iraq civilians.
 
But the deadly clash could reopen an old wound. The Iraqis who were killed had apparently worked for Moktada al- Sadr, a radical Shiite cleric with ties to Iran who has led several bloody rebellions against American forces.
 
Sadr has recently become much more politically aggressive and is considered a pivotal force in the maneuvering over the delayed formation of a new government.
 
Earlier on Sunday, a mortar shell nearly hit Sadr's home in the southern holy city of Najaf. Immediately he accused the Americans of trying to kill him.
 
U.S. officials have been more overt in the past week than ever in blaming Sadr's militia for a wave of sectarian bloodshed that seems to have no end.
 
On Sunday night, U.S. and Iraqi Army forces surrounded a mosque in northeast Baghdad used by Sadr's troops as a headquarters, Iraqi officials said. Helicopters buzzed overhead as heavily armed Humvees sealed off the exits, but when soldiers tried to enter the mosque, shooting erupted, witnesses said, and a gun battle raged for an hour.
 
The Interior Ministry said 17 people had been killed, including the mosque's 80-year-old imam and other civilians.
 
Sheik Yousif al-Nasiri, an aide to Sadr, said that 25 people had been killed and that U.S. troops had shot the mosque guards and then burst inside and killed civilians.
 
A short U.S. news release said that Iraqi Special Forces soldiers, advised by U.S. Special Forces personnel, conducted a raid to "disrupt a terrorist cell" and that "no mosques were entered or damaged during this operation."
 
The release also said no U.S. soldiers had been hurt in the raid, and one prisoner being held by the gunmen had been freed.
 
Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Withington, a U.S. Army spokesman, said he could not comment on any reports of civilian casualties, including the imam.
 
Iraqi television showed what appeared to be a prayer room filled with more than a dozen bodies. Several looked well beyond military age. Some had identification cards on their chests, with jagged bullet holes drilled through the plastic.
 
Just one day earlier, Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador, urged Iraqi leaders to crack down on militias.
 
"More Iraqis are dying from the militia violence than from the terrorists," he said. "The militias need to be under control."
 
Few expect the Shiite prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, to do anything soon. He is embroiled in negotiations over who will serve in the next government, and despite American prodding, little progress has been made. He needs the support of Shiite militia members to keep his job.
 
Both Shiites and Sunnis have militias. But the Shiite militias are much bigger, much better organized and, most critically, much better connected to the Iraqi security forces.$@
