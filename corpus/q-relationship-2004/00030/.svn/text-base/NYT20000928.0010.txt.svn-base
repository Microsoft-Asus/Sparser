SACRAMENTO --
Gov. Gray Davis stuck to his word Wednesday and vetoed two bills that would have expanded domestic partner benefits .
The Democratic governor had previously said he did not want to consider any expansion of the state 's domestic-partner laws , which he signed a year ago .
`` As I said when I vetoed an earlier bill by this author , I would be pleased to consider reasonable changes to the Domestic Partner Act next year , '' Davis said in his veto message of a bill by state Sen. Tom Hayden , D - Los Angeles .
And on another subject that Davis has set forth a strict policy , he vetoed eight bills Wednesday that he said would expand gambling in the state .
Hayden 's bill would have included domestic partners in relationships covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act .
Another bill by Assemblywoman Carole Migden , D - San Francisco , would have made technical changes to the portion of the law allowing seniors to register as domestic partners .
Last year , Davis signed a bill creating a domestic-partner registry and benefits for state employees .
A domestic partner is defined as a member of a couple , over 18 years of age , `` who have chosen to share one another 's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring . ''
Since the statewide registry started at the beginning of the year , 5,523 partnerships have been logged , according to the secretary of state 's office .
Migden and supporters of expanded benefits for gay and lesbian couples say they will be back next year with more comprehensive reform .
`` While this is disappointing , we cannot lose sight of the fact that we had a banner year last year , '' said Eric Astacaan , the lobbyist for the California Alliance for Pride and Equality .
Hayden 's measure was a modified version of a bill Davis vetoed last spring .
At the time , he said it was too broad because it included people who live together but are not related or in a committed relationship , such as roommates .
The revised version that Davis vetoed Wednesday would have included only domestic partners , people caring for grandparents and siblings .
`` I guess -LRB- Davis -RRB- is trying to teach us a lesson to not be in a hurry , but this affects the lives of a lot of people , '' said Hayden , who is leaving office because of term limits .
`` And the people affected ca n't wait -- they have to pay bills every day and go to work while a loved one is home sick . ''
Existing law requires employers to allow family leave only for a birth , adoption or serious illness of a child , to care for a parent or spouse with a serious illness or because of the employee 's health .
Davis ' refusal to consider even technical changes mirrors other stances the self-described centrist has taken .
After signing several gun-control measures in his first term , Davis told several authors of legislation this year that he would veto anything that reached his desk .
And Wednesday , he also vetoed a bill that would have made changes to laws regarding the sale or transfer or firearms , saying , `` It is inconsistent with my policy to provide law enforcement agencies , both state and local , time to absorb and enforce the major firearm provisions that have been recently enacted into law . ''
Davis showed that same attitude on a series of bills that he vetoed related to gambling .
`` As I have said many times , I am not generally inclined to support measures that allow more than a modest expansion of gambling , '' he said in several of the veto messages .
Among other things , the bills would have allowed out-of-state gambling interests to own similar businesses in California , expanded the types of horses allowed to run in quarter horse racing , and allowed wagering on an increased number of horse races .
Last year , Davis signed a compact with California Indian tribes setting a limit on the number of slot machines allowed in the state .
While Davis termed it a `` moderate increase '' in gambling , the non-partisan legislative analyst said the numbers could be very high -- giving the state three times as many machines as New Jersey .
