									<a name="para104"></a><p class="BlockText">The similarities among cells reveal the evolutionary unity of life, yet cells can differ dramatically in structure. Which aspects of cell structure best reveal their evolutionary unity? What are some examples of specialized cellular modifications?</p>

									<a name="para106"></a><p class="BlockText">Imagine protein X, destined to go to the plasma membrane of a cell. Assume the mRNA carrying the genetic message for protein X has already been translated on ribosomes in a cell culture. You collect the cells, break them open, and then fractionate them by differential centrifugation as shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.3</span>. In the pellet of which fraction would you expect to find protein X? Explain your answer by describing the transit of protein X through the cell.</p>

									<a name="para108"></a><p class="BlockText">Doctors at a California university removed a man’s spleen, standard treatment for a type of leukemia. The disease did not recur. Researchers kept some of the spleen cells alive in a nutrient medium. They found that some of the cells produced a blood protein that showed promise for treating cancer and AIDS. The researchers patented the cells. The patient sued, claiming a share in profits from any products derived from his cells. The California Supreme Court ruled against the patient, stating that his suit "threatens to destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research." The U.S. Supreme Court agreed. Do you think the patient was treated fairly? What else you would like to know about this case that might help you make up your mind?</p>
