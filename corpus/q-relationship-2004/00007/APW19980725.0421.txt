SUBIC BAY FREEPORT , Philippines
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Hundreds of police used tear gas in a pre-dawn raid Sunday on a Subic Bay Freeport administrative building to evict holdout supporters of the industrial park 's former chairman .
The tear gas was fired before police special forces broke windows on the second and third floors to enter the headquarters building , which hundreds of supporters of dismissed freeport chairman Richard Gordon had barricaded for nearly a month .
Hundreds of other backers of the ex-chairman gathered outside the building and battled police with rocks and bottles .
One fire truck was set on ablaze and two others damaged .
Dozens of warning shots were fired into the air by police in an attempt to disperse the crowd .
Police were able to take control of the building several hours after the raid began , but Gordon was not found inside , officials said .
At least six pro- Gordan activists were hospitalized , they said .
In a telephone interview with a radio station from an undisclosed location , Gordon appealed to President Joseph Estrada to withdraw the police .
`` You assaulted people who were sleeping , '' he said .
`` You are the ones with power .
Use your power for the people , not against the people . ''
President Estrada , who took office June 30 , fired Gordon and appointed long-time rival Felicito Payumo to take his place .
Payumo has been forced to set up a temporary office at the local airport .

An announcer on the SNN television network commented that it was a sad day for the country as scenes of the fighting in Subic Bay were broadcast .
Gordon insists his tenure has not ended .
He was reappointed to the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year .
The move by Estrada , a former actor and senator who opposed U.S. bases in the Philippines , to replace Gordan appeared to come in retaliation for efforts by the business executive 's followers to prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991 .
Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his presidential campaign in Olongapo , the city adjacent to Subic .
Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last week .
A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did not rule on whether Gordon 's dismissal by Estrada was legal .
Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court 's decision not to extend Gordon 's stay meant that Estrada 's order firing Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately .
The local chamber of commerce has said companies in the freeport , which include Federal Express and Acer , suffered losses totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1 , when Gordon 's supporters temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates .
