ISLAMABAD , August 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Pakistan Thursday warned India not to further develop , deploy and operationalize its nuclear weapons , saying otherwise Pakistan will definitely be forced to follow suit .
At a press briefing here , Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Khan called on the international community to press India to stop its `` nuclear escalation . ''
The Indian assertion of capability for manufacturing the neutron bomb and `` India 's Nuclear Doctrine '' recommended by its National Security Board indicates that India is about to embark on `` a further and even more dangerous escalation in the nuclear and conventional arms build-up , '' Shamshad observed .
Pakistan is `` seriously concerned '' over these developments which pose an intensified threat to the peace and stability of the region and the entire world at large , he said .
Pakistan does not want a nuclear arms race in South Asia , said the foreign secretary , but it cannot afford to ignore the security implications of India 's new doctrine and its ambitious plan of nuclear weapons development including thermonuclear and neutron bombs .
`` The development of our nuclear program will be determined solely by the requirements of our nuclear deterrence capability , '' he stressed .
If India does something in the nuclear field , `` we will no doubt follow suit , '' he explained , adding that `` we will never compromise on the national security . ''
Shamshad noted that Pakistan offered to India a strategic restraint regime to prevent nuclear arms race and maintain nuclear deterrence at the minimum levels after the nuclear tests by the two countries in May last year .
The best option for Pakistan and India today is still to promote the strategic restraint regime envisaging mutual and reciprocal moderation in the nuclear , missile and conventional fields , and a serious endeavor to resolve underlying disputes , specially the Jammu and Kashmir conflict , he said .
He urged the international community to exert their influence on India for the peace and security of the world .
`` It is time now for the international community to eliminate the threat and danger to regional and global security and stability posed by India , '' he said .
