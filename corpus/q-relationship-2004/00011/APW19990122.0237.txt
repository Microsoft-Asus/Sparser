ALEXANDRIA , Va .
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Hand in hand , two former campus Marxists were sentenced to prison Friday for spying for the former East Germany .
Former Pentagon lawyer Theresa Maria Squillacote , 41 , expressed her `` profound regret at the conduct that has brought this case to bear '' as U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton sentenced her to 21 years and 10 months in prison .
Her husband , Kurt Alan Stand , 44 , a former labor union representative , was ordered to serve 17 years and six months .
`` I do take responsibility for what we have done , '' Stand told the judge .
`` These defendants made a choice to betray their country , '' said federal prosecutor Randy Bellows in urging the judge to impose long prison terms .
Squillacote 's lawyer , Lawrence Robbins , said the case `` cannot responsibly be compared '' to the cases of convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard , both of whom were sentenced to life in prison .
Stand 's lawyer , Richard Sauber , said Stand 's actions were hardly `` real espionage activity . ''
He added , `` This is a time period when our former enemies are on C - SPAN , not in prison . ''
Prosecutors had described the Washington , D.C. , couple as dedicated communists who hated the United States and were willing to spy for any country .
They met as student Marxists at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee during the 1970s , and prosecutors said they worked for East Germany throughout the 1970s and 1980s .
Squillacote and Stand were convicted last Oct. 23 of conspiracy , attempted espionage and illegally obtaining national defense documents .
They have been held without bail since their arrest in October 1997 .
They were found guilty of helping set up a spy ring for the former East Germany and of passing classified documents to an FBI agent they thought was a South African intelligence officer .
The two were caught in 1997 after the FBI learned of their attempts to contact the Communist Party in South Africa and set up a sting operation .
Testifying against Squillacote and Stand at their trial was a former college friend , James Michael Clark , a former Army paralegal who was arrested with them .
Clark pleaded guilty last June to conspiring to commit espionage and was sentenced in December to 12 years and seven months in prison .
Prosecutors said Stand began his spying activities in 1972 when he was recruited by East Germany to line up spies in Washington .
He recruited Clark in 1976 and his wife about the time the couple married in 1980 , prosecutors said .
During the early 1990s , Squillacote was hired as a Defense Department analyst .
Prosecutors said she gave the FBI agent Pentagon documents describing arms transactions and assessing U.S. troop strength and another document about U.S. nuclear weapons .
Squillacote left her Pentagon job in January 1997 .
Defense lawyers argued that the couple never gave classified material to foreign agents .
Stand was a regional representative of the International Union of Food , Agricultural , Hotel , Restaurant , Catering , Tobacco and Allied Workers ' Associations .
