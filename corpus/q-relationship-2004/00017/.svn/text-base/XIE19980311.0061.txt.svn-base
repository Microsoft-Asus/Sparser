BRUSSELS , March 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The European Commission -- the EU 's executive body -- approved on Wednesday a wide-ranging proposal to remove trade barriers between the European Union and the United States .
The proposal , known as the New Transatlantic Marketplace -LRB- NTM -RRB- , provides for action in four key areas .
The commission will now be seeking authorization from the Council of Ministers in order to open formal negotiations with the United States .
The areas expecting NTM action include : -- The widespread removal of technical barriers to trade through increased mutual product recognition and/or harmonization ; -- A political commitment to eliminate all industrial tariffs by 2010 as long as a critical mass of other trading partners also agree to do so ; -- The creation of a free trade area in services ; -- And further liberalization of investment , public procurement and intellectual property .
Commission Vice - President Sir Leon Brittan said : `` The New Transatlantic Marketplace is a specifically tailored package of measures to address the real barriers that exist in the EU - U.S. trading relationship .
`` It represents a huge leap forward for Europe 's relationship with the U.S. , bringing not only strong economic benefits for both business and consumers , but also a new political momentum to relations across the Atlantic . ''
The commission set out nine requirements for the NTM to meet , which are : -- The NTM should address the real barriers to EU - U.S. trade and investment ; -- It should bring economic benefit to the EU and the U.S. commensurate with the effort involved ; -- It should not damage and should indeed promote objectives in the future multilateral negotiations within the World Trade Organization ; -- It should not lead to the creation of new trade obstacles to third countries or reduce their access to the EU and the U.S. markets and nor should it
The commission vice-president said that the NTM will be fully compatible with WTO rules and will help pave the way for further multilateral trade liberalization , bringing benefits to third countries .
The trade relationship between the EU and the U.S. is of vital importance to both .
In 1996 alone , two-way trade in goods and services amounted to upwards of 355,000 million ECUs -LRB- 383,400 million U.S. dollars -RRB- .
The EU and the U.S. account for around 19 percent of each other 's total trade in goods .
It is estimated that high technology products account for 20 percent of their two-way trade flow .
The EU is by far the biggest investor in the U.S. , accounting for 59 percent of the total foreign direct investment .
