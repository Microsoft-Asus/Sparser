CHEJU , South Korea --
North and South Korea agreed Tuesday to a limited reopening of the demilitarized zone that separates the countries to repair a railway link that has been severed for more than 50 years .
The agreement , announced at the first talks between the two sides ' defense ministers since the Korean War , is the highest level confirmation of the reconciliation between the two countries since a historic summit meeting in June in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital .
Seeming to overcome the initial reticence of the North to include anything other than rail reconstruction on the agenda for these talks , the defense ministers , Gen. Kim Il Chol for the North and Cho Seong -tae for the South , agreed to `` working level '' military talks .
Those talks are to start next month , followed in November by a second round of ministerial meetings in Pyongyang .
Lt. Gen. Kim Hee -sang , a spokesman for the South Korean defense forces , said the two sides had agreed to discuss in future meetings the creation of a hot line that would link the two military commands .
South Korea had also pushed for mutual notification of major troop movements and for observations of each other 's military exercises .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">At another meeting held simultaneously in Seoul , finance ministers from both countries reached an accord on legal protections for South Korean companies that invest in the economically devastated North .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Additionally , South Korea said it would provide the North with 600,000 tons of food aid , in loans , in the next year .
The aid , worth $ 97 million , is the latest of several grants of economic assistance from the South since the two countries ' presidents met in June .</ENAMEX>
Reopening the long-severed railway has emerged as one of the reconciliation 's few potential short-term economic payoffs for the South .
Seoul has already committed $ 444.8 million to repair the track and build a 12-mile-long highway across the 4-mile-wide DMZ .
Cooperation from the North Korean military is indispensable , though , because the 4-mile-wide area has up to 1 million land mines .
`` Getting these links open would be a big boost to the process of reconciliation , '' one diplomat said .
`` It would prove there is a real willingness to work on common problems , and furthermore it would give South Korea its first land link with the rest of Asia . ''
