ABUJA , Nigeria
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Bidding to bring democracy to an international pariah , U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan held talks Tuesday with Nigeria 's new military ruler and was due to meet the country 's most prominent prisoner .
Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than and hour at the military leader 's state residence in the capital of Abuja .
Annan declined to speak to reporters after the meeting , although a member of his delegation , Ahmad Fawzi , said he had `` frank discussions '' with the military ruler .
The U.N. Secretary General had been granted permission to see Moshood Abiola , the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been imprisoned since 1995 , human rights and government officials said on condition of anonymity .
It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur .
David Attah , a spokesman for the military government said Annan had decided not to speak to journalists until the end of his visit on Thursday .
`` This is to allow the U.N. Secretary General to continue with his consultations with other segments of society ... and he will be briefing the press on Thursday after the meetings , '' Attah said .
Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku was also due to meet Abubakar later Tuesday and would be given the chance to speak to Abiola , human rights activists and government officials said .
Annan , who is from Ghana , and the Nigerian -born Anyaoku are the highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa in November 1995 .
Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was quickly succeeded by Abubakar , a career soldier with little political experience .
The Commonwealth , a 54-nation club of Britain and its former colonies , suspended Nigeria from its ranks following the execution .
Annan expected to sit down with a wide range of pro-democracy and opposition activists during his visit , which he said was aimed at easing Nigeria 's transition to democracy and civilian rule while improving strained international ties with the country .
The U.N. leader on Wednesday planned to attend a `` mini heads-of-state summit '' which was being organized by the Nigerian government , Fawzi said .
It was unclear which leaders had been invited or what was on the agenda and a Nigerian government spokesman gave no details of the possible summit .
The country 's new military leader has raised expectations for democratic reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners and suggesting Abiola too may eventually be freed .
