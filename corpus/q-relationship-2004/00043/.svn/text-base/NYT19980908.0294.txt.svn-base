<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">An infamous national gang , whose earliest roots were nurtured by Latino felons in the prisons of Chicago in the 1940s , is slowly expanding deep into New England , according to authorities who pursued alleged local gangsters for four months</ENAMEX> .
The scheduled arraignment Wednesday of Michael Angel Baez , 18 , arrested in Lowell , Mass .
last weekend on a series of heroin charges , is the latest troubling milepost of the Latin Kings ' incursion into the metropolitan Boston area , police said Tuesday .
`` They 're growing in numbers , '' said Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Quigley , commander of the Massachusetts State Police gang unit .
`` I would n't say it 's growing in large proportions , but there has been an increase in the number of identified gang members . ''
Baez , known as `` King Mikey , '' was accompanied by other alleged members of his gang in Lowell Friday night when he was arrested on a 16-count drug indictment issued by a grand jury earlier that day .
State and local police allege Baez has sold heroin to undercover state troopers .
Tuesday , about seven spectators , who appeared to be supporters of Baez , appeared in Lowell District Court on the mistaken belief he was to be arraigned there .
Dressed mostly in black , they left quickly after Baez did not appear .
Sergeant James Trudel , of the Lowell Police special investigation section , said the four-month probe -- which included undercover and electronic surveillance -- was touched off by a springtime murder that officials worried would trigger even more violence .
Khedy Leang , 13 , was shot to death April 16 -- the youngest ever to die in Lowell as a result of gang activity .
Police said another youth and three friends planned the murder to avenge a knife attack on his cousin .
Though the Latin Kings are not suspects in that murder , they were identified as part of the police crackdown .
`` We decided it was time to start targeting the gang , '' said Trudel .
`` They have a very rigid tier of authority that 's structured so if one person is arrested , the next person in line immediately steps in .
They have chapter meetings and a strict set of rules . ''
Trudel said more arrests are expected .
`` We 're trying to stop them before they get a foothold in the city , '' he said .
`` We 've shown we can go after their top player , and we 're going to work our way down until we can get as many as we can . ''
While Lowell officials said Baez was the leader of just 12 `` hard-core '' followers , Quigley estimated there are as many as 2,000 members of the Latin Kings in Massachusetts .
There are chapters operating in Boston , Worcester , Springfield , Brockton , Lynn , Lawrence , Lowell , Fitchburg and Leominster , he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Latin Kings also have groups now operating from Illinois and Florida and from Connecticut to Texas </ENAMEX>.
The gang 's most conspicuous chapter , in New York City , won national attention last year when its leader , Antonio Fernandez , known as `` King Tone , '' said he was seeking to transform the gang from street-corner violence to storefront activism .
Locally , members of the Kings have promised to use five points of their so-called `` crown '' -- love , respect , sacrifice , honor and obedience -- for good .
But if the members have heard the more temperate edicts from the group 's national leader in New York , local authorities say they 've seen little evidence of it .
`` We 're aware of what they 're proclaiming , but we just have n't seen it here , '' said Quigley .
`` We 're dealing with crimes that they commit .
And a lot of the crimes they commit are against their own people , be it assault and battery or extortion . ''
Students of street gangs said the temperate rhetoric is little more than a facade for far-reaching criminal enterprises .
`` They have employed a very sly method of deceiving the public , '' said Edwin Delattre , dean of the Boston University School of Education who had studied and written about gangs .
`` Their real business is criminality and criminal conspiracy .
`` They present this front that says they 're interested in civic and ethnic pride and the self-esteem of the young .
They have mastered this jargon and the lingo of being on the side of the young , '' Delattre said .
`` But they have deceived parents , and children and business people alike .
These people are not benevolent .
They 're dangerous . ''
Delattre said the Latin Kings , already estimated at 30,000 strong nationwide , are pushing for a national membership of 100,000 within a few years .
In New York , David C. Brotherton , a gang specialist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is writing a book about the Latin Kings , said there is evidence that the Latin Kings are seeking to remake themselves .
`` We 're seeing it in terms of their drop in the involvement in crime and the recidivism has dropped , '' said Brotherton , who has interviewed more than 100 gang members .
But police are skeptical , and intend to keep pressure on the Latin Kings ' fledgling efforts in Lowell .
`` All the interaction that I 've had with the Latin Kings shows that they 're gang members with one thing in mind , '' said Trudel , `` and that purpose is to spread their gang through criminal activity .
I consider them a dangerous organization .
We want to have them looking over their shoulder . ''
