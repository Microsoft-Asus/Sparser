CHEMORECEPTION--TASTE AND SMELL

 

 Perceptions of taste and smell are usually interrelated



Many animals use their chemical senses to find mates (as when male silk moths respond to pheromones emitted by females), to recognize territory that has been marked by some chemical substance (as when dogs and cats sniff boundaries that have been staked out by their spraying neighbors), and to help navigate during migration (as when salmon use the unique scent of their streams of origin to return for breeding). Chemical "conversation" is especially important for animals, such as ants and bees, that live in large social groups. In all animals, taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are important in feeding behavior. For example, a hydra begins to swallow when chemoreceptors detect the compound glutathione, which is released from prey captured by the hydra's tentacles.
