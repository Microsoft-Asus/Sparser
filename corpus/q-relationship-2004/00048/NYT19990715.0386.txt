TORONTO --
Mounting concern in the United States over the export of military technology without adequate controls is threatening an ambitious new program to train fighter pilots from several NATO countries in the vast skies over Western Canada .
U.S. regulators are refusing to issue an export license for 24 high-powered American -made training planes until they get iron-clad guarantees from the Canadian government that the aircraft , and the technology that went into its development , will not fall into the hands of unfriendly nations .
Regulators are worried because the planes are being purchased not by the Canadian government , but by a private company in Canada that in 1997 was awarded a $ 2.8 billion contract to run the NATO training program .
At the time , no one expected problems .
Since then , though , the unauthorized transfer of classified military technology to China and examples of restricted military hardware finding its way to third countries from Canada have heightened concerns about this program .
Congress could try to hold up the $ 82 million sale to Canada until it gets assurances that the planes will not be resold to countries that otherwise would not be allowed to have them .
Weapons smugglers have used Canada to circumvent American export restrictions so often that the Clinton administration recently imposed tough new controls on sales of weapons and military technology to Canada .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY-DEL">The sale to Bombardier of Montreal of 24 T -6A-1 Raytheon Aircraft turboprop trainers , the basic training plane for the U.S. Navy and Air Force , would be the first transfer of American military technology to the private sector , U.S. officials said .</ENAMEX>
In a drive to balance its budget , the Canadian government gave the contract to Bombardier , and also leased it a base -- Moose Jaw in Saskatchewan -- thereby saving the base from what would have been an unpopular closure .
Officials in Washington are concerned that selling planes to Bombardier could set a precedent that powerful foreign corporations would cite in other purchases .
`` We sell airplanes to governments , not to private companies , '' said a senior American official opposed to the sale .
`` If the contract goes bust , where do the assets go ? ''
Delivery of the planes is scheduled to begin in October but the United States ' demands could force delays .
`` We have advised our customer -- the Ministry of National Defense -- that there may be a schedule impact , '' said Zev Rosenzweig , vice president of aviation training in the defense division of Bombardier Aerospace .
`` But this situation is so different from what happened with China that I have faith that even Congress people will appreciate the difference . ''
But James Richardson , manager of the NATO Flying Training in Canada program for Canada 's Department of National Defense , said maintenance and operating schedules for the sophisticated trainers were not ready because the State Department had not allowed Raytheon to provide Canada with the necessary specifications .
`` As Raytheon got to the point of providing that information , things slowed down in a hurry , '' Richardson said .
Raytheon officials are uneasy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY-DEL">James Gregory , a Raytheon spokesman , said that if the sale was not approved expeditiously , the multimillion-dollar order `` could go to an international competitor . ''</ENAMEX>
Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kan. , where Raytheon Aircraft is situated , has written to the State Department to object to the way regulators have jeopardized the sale .
Brownback 's staff refused to discuss his objections .
Originally , Canada had planned to buy the trainers from the Embraer company of Brazil , but switched to Raytheon when Embraer could not guarantee delivery in time .
Washington officials say they are not unduly suspicious of Canada or Bombardier -- a diversified corporation best known for manufacturing snowmobiles but now a major aerospace producer .
But they are concerned about Canada 's ability to control the re-export of American military technology .
For decades , Canada enjoyed special exemption from most military export controls , reflecting its decision after World War II to forgo its own defense industry and instead supply components to American weapons contractors from whom it has made most purchases .
But in April , severe restrictions were put on Canada after what senior American officials involved in defense trade described as recent incidents in which Canada was intended to be a conduit for supplying helicopters , missile parts and other military items to countries forbidden to buy them .
Under the new rules , military exports to Canada will become much more cumbersome .
What is at risk , said Daniel Verreault , vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada , is $ 5 billion a year in military goods and services that has developed out of the special relationship between the two countries .
Bombardier officials say that they need to recruit pilots from several NATO and non- NATO countries to recoup their costs over the projected 20-year life of its $ 2.8 billion contract for pilot training programs .
So far , Denmark has signed a $ 250 million contract to train six of its pilots every year for the next 20 years in Canada .
Negotiations are close to being complete with Britain , company officials said .
Bombardier also is talking to Italy , and to one non- NATO country .
Rosenzweig of Bombardier said that additional aircraft would have to be purchased as the other nations signed up their pilots but he said that the bonds sold to purchase the Raytheon planes are backed completely by the tuition for training Canadian pilots , and therefore there is `` zero chance of default. '' .
The initial purchase of 24 aircraft is being undertaken by a paper company called Milit - Air Inc. , which was set up by Bombardier and will then lease the planes for 20 years to Bombardier Aerospace .
Bombardier is also spending $ 400 million to buy 18 British Aerospace Mark 115 Hawks , modified to simulate the flight of F -18 fighter jets .
Rosenzweig said the first student pilots were supposed to begin training in February , starting on the T -6A trainer , then on the Hawk .
The unusual private sector arrangement is raising concerns in Canada , as well .
Art Hanger , a member of Parliament from Alberta and military affairs critic for the opposition , said he did not know what guarantees Bombardier or the government had offered about the eventual use of the Raytheon planes .
Hanger said he was still trying to get information from Ottawa about the sale of more than 30 American -made Vietnam -era helicopters disposed of at a government surplus sale conducted by a private company in 1996 .
The private purchaser of the helicopters then attempted to sell a number of them to the government of Iraq .
In 1997 , the plan was uncovered by American officials and stopped .
American regulators say they want the Bombardier project to be a success .
But they say it is better to insist on tight controls now -- such as preventing Canadians who hold dual citizenship with countries like Iraq or Iran from working at the training base -- in order to prevent problems in future .
