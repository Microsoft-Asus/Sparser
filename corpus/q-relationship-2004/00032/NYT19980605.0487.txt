IRVING , Texas --
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that defensive end Tony Tolbert 's status is more of a health issue than a financial one .
However , the free-agent status of popular veteran safety Bill Bates and running back Herschel Walker are vastly different , Jones said .
Jones expects decisions on the players ' futures to be made during training camp .
Tolbert , who will count $ 3,447,000 against this season 's salary cap , underwent surgery on both knees a few weeks ago .
Jones said if Tolbert can regain his health completely , is cleared to play by doctors and wants to play , then `` his contract is not an issue . ''
Jones said he 's under the impression the surgery could heal Tolbert 's knees for the first time in a couple of years .
The Cowboys had believed that Tolbert , a Pro Bowl selection in 1996 who was reduced to a part-time player due to his knees , had chronic knee problems that were beyond repair .
Tolbert said he will make an evaluation in the best interest of his career and his family when he gets healthy .
He said he 's solely concentrating on getting healthy right now .
Time , however , is also an issue , Jones said .
He said he expects to know something before training camp .
If the health issue is not resolved by then , the Cowboys could save close to $ 2 million on the salary cap if they release Tolbert or he retires .
The Cowboys could also try to sign him to a lowered salary if they believe he can contribute at some point during the season .
Jones said the question with Walker is whether the running back wants to play again .
`` It 's not necessarily our decision , '' Jones said .
`` He will decide if he wants to play or not .
It really is Herschel 's call . ''
However , Bates , who is looking to play a team record 16th season with the Cowboys , does not control his own fate .
Jones said the team will decide during training camp Bates ' future based on the progress made by current players at filling Bates ' role in the nickel defense and on special teams .
