Russia and Japan have made considerable progress in preparing a peace treaty that would formally end World War II , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday .
The two countries have never signed a treaty ending the war because of a dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain that were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news briefing that the latest meeting between a Russian and Japanese treaty commission in Tokyo on June 22 `` showed the sides ' constructive mood and converging positions on the majority of the issues , '' the Interfax news agency reported .
He said the two sides `` have started to coordinate the main provisions of the future treaty , except for the territorial issues . ''
Gennady Seleznyov , the speaker of parliament 's lower house , said Russia will never allow the Kurils to fall under Japanese jurisdiction .
`` There has been some speculation recently about a possible handover of some of our territories to certain countries , '' Seleznyov said , according to the ITAR - Tass news agency .
`` This will never happen , '' he said , adding that the Russian Constitution clearly prohibits such actions .
