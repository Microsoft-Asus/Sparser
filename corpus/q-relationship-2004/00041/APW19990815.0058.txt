WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Situated between south Florida and the South American cocaine and heroin belt , Cuba 's skies and extensive territorial waters have been handy transit points for drug traffickers .
That link now has the attention of CIA investigators .
Pressured by congressional critics of Cuban President Fidel Castro , the CIA will try to determine whether the United States was the ultimate destination of a shipment of cocaine that was scheduled to transit Cubans waters but instead was seized by Colombian police at the port of Cartagena last December .
Cuba has denied official involvement in any such activity .
Indeed , Castro has declared his own war on drugs and has even invited the United States to join him in an anti-drug campaign so the two countries could become `` one of the greatest alliances against drug trafficking . ''
Contrary to the Clinton administration 's view , congressional critics say the evidence suggests an official Cuban role in supporting drug trafficking .
They say Cuba qualifies under State Department criteria as a `` major '' drug transit country , citing the planned stop in Cuban waters of the abortive drug shipment in December .
An investigation of that shipment was carried out in February by staff members from two congressional committees .
Of particular interest to them was whether the final destination for the shipment was the United States .
The staffers reported that a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official said `` in all likelihood the Dec. 3 shipment of cocaine to Cuba was eventually meant to transit through Mexico and on to the U.S. '' Cuba says the shipment was earmarked for Spain .
The State Department initially agreed but now is not so sure .
Earlier this month , the department asked the CIA to `` conduct an all-source review of intelligence community and law enforcement community data to shed further light on the ultimate destination of this shipment . ''
A CIA finding that the shipment was intended to reach U.S. markets after passing through Cuban waters could lead to Cuba 's placement on the `` majors '' list of drug-trafficking countries .
Cuba would thus be subject , much like Colombia and Mexico , to a State Department evaluation on its anti-drug performance each year .
The campaign for Cuba 's inclusion on the list is being led by Reps .
Benjamin Gilman , R - N.Y. , chairman of the House International Relations Committee ; and Dan Burton , R - Ind. , chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee .
Barry McCaffrey , the White House drug policy director , has acknowledged that traffickers have been making increased use of Cuban air space and territorial waters .
But he noted that Cuba maintains it does not have the resources to patrol these large areas , especially its territorial waters .
`` There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Cuban leadership is currently involved in this criminal activity , '' McCaffrey said .
But Castro 's detractors object even to the limited U.S. - Cuban anti-drug cooperation currently in place .
Rep. Ileana Ros - Lehtinen , R - Fla. , said it is preposterous for the administration to give Castro credibility on the drug issue because she contends the Cuban leader is notorious for helping traffickers .
A fellow Cuban -born lawmaker , Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart , R - Fla. , joined in the objection .
Inclusion on the `` majors '' list of drug-trafficking countries could be a potential stigma for Cuba and be used against the communist regime by its U.S. enemies , many of whom suspect the administration is seeking normal relations with the island .
Being on the list , now numbering 28 countries , does not imply that the government in question is working in league with the traffickers .
Countries found not cooperating with U.S. anti-drug efforts are `` decertified '' and can be subject to economic sanctions .
This would not be a problem for Cuba since it already is under comprehensive sanctions .
Virtually all Andean countries plus Mexico are on the list .
But as of the most recent State Department evaluation , all were `` certified '' as fully cooperating with U.S. counternarcotics efforts .
