WASHINGTON --
A program that allows some visitors to the United States to enter the country without a visa is helping criminals and terrorists and increasing illegal immigration , according to an internal investigation at the Department of Justice .
The agency 's inspector general found that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has not done enough to end abuses of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program , which lets people carrying passports from any of 26 nations to visit the United States for up to 90 days without first obtaining a visa .
The program has been in place since 1988 .
The program , which was intended to cut down on paperwork in admitting large numbers of visitors from a small number of countries , is strongly supported by the trade and tourism industries .
In 1997 , 14.5 million visitors entered the United States under the visa waiver program , coming from the United Kingdom , Japan , Germany , Italy , Sweden , Ireland , Brunei , Slovenia and Andorra , among other countries .
But Michael R. Bromwich , the inspector general , said : `` Our review found that terrorists , criminals , smugglers , and others have attempted to enter the United States using stolen blank passports from a Visa Waiver country or by altering or counterfeiting these passports . ''
He testified about his office 's report at a Congressional hearing last month .
Few VWPP countries reported problems with passport theft prior to participation in the program , INS officials said .
But the agency estimates that more than 100,000 blank passports have been stolen in the last several years .
When investigators looked at a a sample of 1,067 blank VWPP passports reported stolen in 1997 , almost 4 percent matched passports successfully presented for entry into the United States , the inspector general 's audit found .
Extrapolating from that sample , the auditors suggested that thousands of people might have misused stolen passports in this way .
INS inspectors interviewed for the report said that identified terrorists and criminals believed that they would receive less scrutiny and would have a better chance of avoiding interception if they entered the United States under the visa waiver program .
One of the conspirators later convicted in the World Trade Center bombing attempted entry into the United States in 1992 with a fraudulent Swedish passport , unsuccessfully trying to exploit Sweden 's participation in the program .
He was briefly detained and then deported .
In 1998 , two Irish men , one of whom admitted membership in the Irish Republican Army , were denied entry when INS inspectors learned that the applicant was also a member of the Real IRA -- a terrorist group that has broken away from the original IRA .
In 1988 , the INS in New York discovered a trend in which Nigerian drug couriers were using photo-substituted passports from the United Kingdom to smuggle narcotics into the country .
The program also makes it easier to immigrate illegally to the United States , investigators said .
Because the program eliminates the need to obtain a visa , visitors under the program avoid the pre-screening that consular officers normally perform on visa applicants .
INS inspectors at ports of entry become the principle means of preventing illegal entry .
But the inspectors have , on average , less than one minute to check and make their decision on each visitor .
The INS has said it `` generally '' supported the findings in the report , but pointed to several factors out of its control .
For example , the State Department nominates countries for the program , and participating countries have their own standards for issuing passports and reporting them stolen .
Michael A. Pearson , the executive associate commissioner for field operations at the INS , said that there was no built-in mechanism for dealing with security breakdowns .
`` The program 's lack of appropriate law enforcement standards mandating compliance or removal from the program has only increased as the program has been expanded , '' Pearson wrote in his response to the inspector general 's review .
`` Regrettably , the statute and standards for law enforcement concerns have not evolved with the expansion and we are now in the position of operating this program , which was predicated on low risk , in a high-risk environment . ''
The inspector general recommended that INS build a complete data base on stolen passports from countries that participate in the program , and make sure that all passport numbers are checked against the data base in a lookout system used by agents at the border .
