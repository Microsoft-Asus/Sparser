UNITED NATIONS , June 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A new report on Child soldiers has found that more than 120,000 children under 18 years of age are being used as soliders across Africa .
Some of these children are even no more than 7 years of age .
The report , released recently by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , said the most affected were such countries as Burundi , Congo -LRB- B -RRB- , Congo -LRB- K -RRB- , Liberia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Sudan and Uganda .
These African children are among at least 300,000 children under the age of 18 , girls as well as boys , are currently taking part in hostilities around the world .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">African children are being targeted across the continent as tools of war , '' said Reed Brody , the chairman of the coalition .
He called upon the African governments to stop recruiting children into their own armed forces and to end all support to rebel groups that used children as soldiers</ENAMEX> .
`` These research should provoke outrage from civil society and governments like , '' said Iain Levine , a U.N. official in the field of human rights , `` We hope it will compel action to end this horrific problem . ''
Children are often recruited by government and rebel armed forces to beef up its own military strength in the armed conflicts .
Some children do volunteer to join the armed forces , but tens of thousands of children are forced to join up , sometimes at gun point .
In Angola , forced recruitment of youth continues in some of the suburbs around the capital and throughout the country , especially in rural areas .
Hundreds of thousands more are enrolled in governmental armed forces or armed opposition groups and made to fight at any moment .
While many are lawfully recruited , others are kidnapped , press-ganged or in one way or another coerce to join .
Although most child soldiers are between 15 and 18 years of age , significant recruitment starts at the age of 10 , and the use of even younger children has been recorded , said the coalition .
Girls , too , are recruited , often forcibly , though in smaller number than boys .
They tend to be used as cooks , for example .
Surprisingly , the girls are used in the front line .
In fact , they turn out to be nothing but cannon fodder .
Displaced communities and refugees in camps are at particular risk of being exploited by armed entities : families have been torn apart , and as a consequence , their children are left to their own devices ; community support structures have broken down , and the general situation is one of profound social and economic uncertainty .
Refugees are often at the mercy of armed grounds using camps as easy recruitment grounds .
The particular vulnerability of displaced children to recruitment by armed groups , especially those living in camps close to the conflict , is increasingly recognized by the international community .
The overwhelming majority of African countries have set 18 years as the minimum age for recruitment , whether voluntary or through conscriptions .
Notable exceptions are Angola , which recently reduced conscription age to 17 , and Uganda , which appears to allow children over 13 years of age to enlist in certain circumstances .
South Africa , which currently accepts volunteers at 17 years , plans to raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years in the coming months .
