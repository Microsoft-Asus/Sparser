This chapter continues the saga of how plants adapted to land and transformed Earth. The beautifully preserved squash seed in the photo, discovered in 1997 in a cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, symbolizes two important landmarks in the evolution of plants: (1) the evolution of seed plants, which led to the gymnosperms and angiosperms, the plants that dominate most modern landscapes, and (2) the emergence of the importance of seed plants to animals, specifically to humans in this case.

Why was this discovery front-page news for many newspapers and scientific journals? The cave had been occupied by humans some 8,000-10,000 years ago, and the seeds and pieces of squash fruit found there differ enough from wild varieties of the same species to suggest that humans had already begun cultivating the plants, perhaps more for gourds than for food. If this interpretation is correct, then agriculture started at about the same time--approximately 10,000 years ago--in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. (Before this discovery, scientists had been able to trace American agriculture back only about 5,000 years.) The invention of agriculture, which depends almost entirely on the cultivation and harvest of seed plants, was the single most important cultural change in the history of humanity, for it made possible the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to permanent settlements.

More generally, the seeds and other adaptations of gymnosperms and angiosperms enhanced the ability of plants to survive and reproduce in diverse terrestrial environments, and these plants became the main producers supporting the food webs of most ecosystems on land. Our study of gymnosperms and angiosperms begins with an overview of some of the key terrestrial adaptations that seed plants added to those already in place in the bryophytes and seedless vascular plants you learned about in Chapter 29.

 The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms



Seed plants are vascular plants that produce seeds. Modifications in life cycles contributed to the success of seed plants as terrestrial organisms. Here we examine the three most important reproductive adaptations: continued reduction of the gametophyte, the advent of the seed, and the evolution of pollen.





GYMNOSPERMS

 

 The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms



 

 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers



 

 The life cycle of a pine demonstrates the key reproductive adaptations of seed plants



The most familiar gymnosperms are the conifers, the cone-bearing plants such as pines. Gymnosperms (the term means "naked seeds") lack the enclosed chambers (ovaries) in which angiosperm ovules and seeds develop. Rather, gymnosperm ovules and seeds develop on the surfaces of specialized leaves called sporophylls. Gymnosperms appear in the fossil record much earlier than angiosperms.

 The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era



 

 Angiosperms and animals have shaped one another's evolution



Angiosperms, better known as flowering plants, are vascular seed plants that produce the reproductive structures called flowers and fruits. Today, angiosperms are by far the most diverse and geographically widespread of all plants. There are about 250,000 known species of angiosperms, compared with about 720 gymnosperm species.





PLANTS AND HUMAN WELFARE

 

 Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms



 

 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource



The absolute dependence of humans on Earth's flora is a specific and highly refined case of the more general connection between animals and plants. Of course, we humans, like most of Earth's species, depend on photosynthetic organisms for their ecological "services" of food production and oxygen release. What is special about our relationship with plants is our development of technology to maximize the harvest of plant products for human use. The lumber industry is an example. But the most important example is agriculture.





 Reduction of the gametophyte continued with the evolution of seed plants

In Chapter 29, we discussed an important distinction between the life cycles of mosses and other bryophytes and the life cycles of ferns and other seedless vascular plants: a gametophyte-dominant life cycle for bryophytes versus a sporophyte-dominant life cycle for seedless vascular plants. That trend continued with the evolution of seed plants--the gymnosperms and angiosperms. The gametophytes of seed plants are even more reduced than the gametophytes of seedless vascular plants such as ferns. And in seed plants, the miniature female gametophytes develop from spores that are retained within the sporangia of the parental sporophyte. One advantage of this arrangement is that the delicate female gametophytes do not have to cope with many environmental stresses. These female gametophytes and the young embryos they produce after fertilization are sheltered from drought and harmful UV radiation by their enclosure within the moist reproductive tissues of the parental sporophyte generation. This relationship also makes it possible for the gametophytes to obtain nutrients from their parents. In contrast, the free- living gametophytes of seedless vascular plants must fend for themselves (see FIGURE 29.23).

This protection of female gametophytes within sporophyte tissues required extreme miniaturization of the gametophytes. The free-living gametophytes of seedless vascular plants (pteridophytes), though small compared to the sporophytes, are visible to the unaided eye. But the gametophytes of seed plants are microscopic. FIGURE 30.1 reviews this terrestrial adaptation of seed plants by contrasting the sporophyte-gametophyte relationships for different plant groups.

Fig 30-1. Three variations on gametophyte/sporophyte relationships.

Why has the gametophyte generation not been completely eliminated from the plant life cycle? One hypothesis is that haploid gametophytes provide a mechanism for "screening" alleles, including new mutations. Gametophytes with deleterious mutations that affect basic metabolism and cell division will not survive to produce gametes that could combine to start new sporophytes.

Another possible reason that the gametophyte has not gone completely "out of style" in seed plants is that all sporophyte embryos are dependent, at least to some extent, on tissues of the maternal gametophyte. You learned, for example, that in bryophytes the embryonic sporophyte is nourished by a gametophyte as it grows from the archegonium. You'll soon learn that even in seed plants, the gametophyte continues to play a role in nourishing the sporophyte embryo, at least during its early development.





 Seeds became an important means of dispersing offspring

In bryophytes and seedless vascular plants such as ferns, spores produced by sporophytes are the resistant stage in the life cycle--that is, the stage that can withstand harsh environments. (A spore, recall from Chapter 29, is a resistant cell that can develop into a new organism.) For example, the spores of a moss might be able to survive even if the local environment becomes too cold, too hot, or too dry for the moss plants themselves to live. And because of their tiny size, the spores might also be dispersed in a dormant state to a new area, where they will germinate to give rise to new moss gametophytes if and when the environment is favorable enough for them to break dormancy. Spores were the main way that plants spread over the Earth for the first 200 million years of plant life on land.

The seed represents a different solution to resisting harsh environments and dispersing offspring. In contrast to a spore, which is single-celled, a seed is a resistant structure that is multicellular and much more complex. A seed consists of a sporophyte embryo packaged along with a food supply within a protective coat. There are evolutionary and developmental relationships between spores and seeds. Recall from the previous section that the reduced gametophytes of seed plants develop within tissues of the parental sporophyte. This occurs because the parent sporophyte does not release its spores, but instead retains them within its sporangia. Not only are the spores retained within the sporangia instead of being released, but the gametophyte develops within the confines of the spore from which it is derived (see FIGURE 30.1c).

All seed plants are heterosporous, meaning they have two different types of sporangia that produce two types of spores: Megasporangia produce megaspores, which give rise to female (egg-containing) gametophytes; microsporangia produce microspores, which give rise to male (sperm-containing) gametophytes. And recall from Chapter 29 that some seedless vascular plants, including certain ferns, are also hetero sporous. The gametophytes of those plants develop within the spore walls, as they do in seed plants. What distinguishes seed plants is that the megaspores, and hence the female gametophytes, are retained on the parent sporophyte.

In seed plants, layers of sporophyte tissues called integuments envelop the megasporangium. Thus a megaspore formed within the megasporangium is very well protected. The whole structure--integuments, megasporangium, and megaspore--is called an ovule (FIGURE 30.2a). A female gametophyte develops inside a megaspore and produces one or more egg cells. And if an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm (FIGURE 30.2b), the zygote develops into a sporophyte embryo. The whole ovule develops into a seed (FIGURE 30.2c).

Fig 30-2. From ovule to seed.

A seed's protective seed coat is derived from the integuments of the ovule. Once released from the parent plant, a seed may remain dormant for days, months, or even years. Under favorable conditions, the seed can then germinate, its sporophyte embryo emerging through the seed coat as a seedling. Some seeds drop close to their parents; others are carried far by wind or animals (FIGURE 30.3).

 Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization

We have seen the relationship of the megasporangium to the ovule and the seed, but what goes on in a microsporangium of a seed plant? Microspores develop into pollen grains, which mature to become the male gametophytes of seed plants. The pollen grains, protected by tough sporopollenin-containing coats (see p. 580), can be carried away by wind or animals after their release from the microsporangium.

The transfer of pollen to ovules is called pollination. If a pollen grain lands in the vicinity of an ovule, it will elongate a tube that discharges one or more sperm into the female gametophyte within the ovule (see FIGURE 30.2b). In some gymnosperms, the sperm cells retain the ancestral flagellated condition. But in the most common gymnosperms (the conifers) and in all angiosperms (flowering plants), the sperm lack flagella.

This mechanism for transfer of sperm contrasts sharply with what we observed in seedless plants. Recall that in bryophytes and pteridophytes such as ferns, flagellated sperm released from antheridia must swim through a film of water to reach egg cells in archegonia. The distance for this sperm transport rarely exceeds a few centimeters. In seed plants, the use of resistant, far-traveling, airborne pollen to bring gametes together is a terrestrial adaptation that led to even greater success and diversity of plants on land.





 The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms

Progress in biology due to new methods, new data, and new ideas is what makes this subject so much fun. Each new edition of this textbook requires revision of most of the phylogenetic trees to reflect the ongoing revolution in systematics. Phylogenetic trees and the classifications they inform, remember, are hypotheses about the history of life. And in the case of seed plant phylogeny, the data now support a tree with two main monophyletic branches--the gymnosperms and the angiosperms--as depicted in FIGURE 30.4. Gymnosperms and angiosperms probably evolved from different ancestors in an extinct group of plants called progymnosperms, some of which had seeds.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-4. Hypothetical phylogeny of the seed plants. Recent research supports the division of the seed plants into two distinct clades (monophyletic branches), the gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, evolutionary relationships among the major groups within each of the two seed-plant clades is less certain, which is why the bases of those subbranches are broken lines in this diagram. The numbering of the seed-plant phyla in this tree corresponds to our introduction to plant diversity in Chapter 29, reviewed here in the inset. Note that the taxonomy adopted by this text recognizes four phyla of gymnosperms, but groups all angiosperms into a single phylum, Anthophyta.

The two key reproductive adaptations of seed plants--seeds and pollen--will seem less abstract once we have looked more closely at the diversity of gymnosperms and angiosperms.





 The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms





The gymnosperms probably descended from progymnosperms, a group of Devonian plants (see FIGURE 30.4). The earliest progymnosperms were seedless plants, but by the end of the Devonian period, seeds had evolved in some progymnosperm species. Adaptive radiation during the Carboniferous and early Permian produced the various phyla of gymnosperms.

In the history of life, the Permian period was one of great crises. Formation of the supercontinent Pangaea (see Chapter 25) may have been one reason that continental interiors became warmer and drier as the Permian progressed. The flora and fauna of Earth changed dramatically, as many groups of organisms disappeared and others emerged as their successors. The changeover was most pronounced in the seas, but terrestrial life was affected as well. In the animal kingdom, amphibians decreased in diversity and were replaced by reptiles, which were especially well adapted to the arid conditions. Similarly, the lycophytes, horsetails, and ferns that dominated the Carboniferous swamps were largely replaced by gymnosperms, which were more suited to the drier climate. The world and its life had changed so markedly that geologists use the end of the Permian period, about 245 million years ago, as the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. (This boundary was originally defined by the changeover in marine fossils.) The terrestrial animals of the Mesozoic, including the dinosaurs, were supported by a vegetation consisting mostly of conifers and great palmlike cycads, two phyla of gymnosperms. At the end of the Mesozoic, a powerful meteorite or comet impact and intensive volcanic activity contributed to a cooler climate, and the dinosaurs became extinct. Many of the gymnosperms persisted, however, and are still an important part of Earth's flora.





 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers

Of the ten plant phyla in the taxonomic scheme adopted by this textbook (see TABLE 29.1), four are grouped as gymnosperms (see FIGURE 30.4). Three are relatively small phyla: Ginkgophyta, Cycadophyta, and Gnetophyta. Ginkgo biloba is the only extant species of phylum Ginkgophyta. It has fanlike leaves that turn gold and are deciduous in autumn (FIGURE 30.5). Gingko is the source of a popular over-the-counter herbal preparation that some people believe improves memory. Cycads (phylum Cycadophyta) superficially resemble palms, which are actually flowering plants (FIGURE 30.6). Phylum Gnetophyta consists of three genera that are very different in appearance (FIGURE 30.7). One, Welwitschia, has giant straplike leaves. Plants of the second genus, Gnetum, grow in the tropics as trees or vines. Ephedra (Mormon tea), the third genus of Gnetophyta, is a shrub of the American deserts.

The left photo illustrates the summer green leaf color, while the top inset shows the leaves in autumn gold. Female trees produce fleshy seeds (bottom inset) whose seed coats emit a repulsive (to humans, at least) odor as they decay. The rotting flesh produces some of the same organic acids found in rancid butter, skunk spray, and human body odor, so landscapers usually plant only male (pollen-producing) trees.

By far the largest of the four gymnosperm phyla is phylum Coniferophyta, the conifers. The term conifer (from the Latin conus, cone, and ferre, to carry) comes from the reproductive structure of these plants, the cone, which is a cluster of scalelike sporophylls. Pines, firs, spruces, larches, yews, junipers, cedars, cypresses, and redwoods all belong to this phylum of gymnosperms (FIGURE 30.8, p. 604). Many are large trees. Although there are only about 550 species of conifers, a few of those species dominate vast forested regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where the growing season is relatively short because of latitude or altitude.

"Doug fir" provides more timber than any other North American tree species. Uses for the wood include house framing, plywood production, pulpwood for paper, railroad ties, and boxes and crates. (b) Sequoia. This giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in California's Sequoia National Park dwarfs the tourists at the bottom of this scene. It weighs about 2,500 metric tons, equivalent to about 14 blue whales (the largest animals), or 40,000 people. (c) Cypress. The "Lone Cypress" (Cupressus macrocarpa) in Monterey, California, is one of the world's most photographed trees. (d) Pacific yew. The bark of Pacific yew (Taxa brevifolia) is a source of taxol, a compound used to treat women with ovarian cancer. The leaves of a European yew species produce a similar compound, which can be harvested without destroying the plants. And pharmaceutical companies are now refining techniques for synthesizing drugs with taxol-like properties. (e) Common juniper. The "berries" of the common juniper (Juniperus communis) are actually ovule-producing cones consisting of fleshy sporophylls. An extract from juniper "berries" gives gin its distinctive flavor. (f) A pine farm. This loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) farm in South Carolina is a clone of fast-growing trees cultivated from cell cultures that produce seedlings (inset). (g) Wollemia pine. A survivor of a conifer group once known only from fossils, the Wollemia pine (Wollemia nobilis) was discovered alive in 1994 in a national park only 150 kilometers from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The species has only 40 known individuals in two small groves. The inset compares the leaves of this "living fossil" with actual fossils.

Most conifers are evergreens, meaning they retain leaves throughout the year. Even during winter, a limited amount of photosynthesis occurs on sunny days. And when spring comes, conifers already have fully developed leaves that can take advantage of the sunnier days. However, some conifers have deciduous leaves that drop in the autumn. The dawn redwood and tamarack are two examples.

The needle-shaped leaves of some conifers, such as pines and firs, are adapted to dry conditions. A thick cuticle covers the leaf, and the stomata are located in pits, further reducing water loss.

We get much of our lumber and paper pulp from the wood of conifers. What we call wood is actually xylem tissue, which gives the tree structural support.

Coniferous trees are among the largest and oldest organisms on Earth. Redwoods, found only in a narrow coastal strip of northern California, grow to heights of more than 110 m; only certain eucalyptus trees in Australia are taller. Bristlecone pines, another species of California conifer, are among the oldest organisms alive. One bristlecone, named Methuselah, is more than 4,600 years old; it was a young tree when humans invented writing.





 The life cycle of a pine demonstrates the key reproductive adaptations of seed plants

You learned earlier in the chapter that the evolution of seed plants added three key terrestrial adaptations in reproduction: the increasing dominance of the sporophyte generation; the advent of the seed as a resistant, dispersible stage in the life cycle; and the evolution of pollen as an airborne agent that brings gametes together. Examining the life cycle of a pine, one of the most familiar of conifers and gymnosperms, will reinforce your understanding of these adaptations (FIGURE 30.9, p. 605).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-9. The life cycle of a pine. 
			  
		 Trees (sporophytes) of most species bear both pollen cones and ovulate cones. 
			  
		 A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia held in small reproductive leaves, or sporophylls. Cells in the micro sporangia undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid microspores that develop into pollen grains (immature male gametophytes). 
			  
		 An ovulate cone consists of many scales, each with two ovules. Each ovule includes a megasporangium. 
			  
		 During pollination, windblown pollen falls on the ovulate cone and is drawn into the ovule through the micropyle. The pollen grain germinates in the ovule, forming a pollen tube that begins to digest its way through the megasporangium. Fertilization usually occurs more than a year after pollination. During that year, 
			  
		 a megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid cells. One of these cells survives as a megaspore, which grows and divides repeatedly, giving rise to the immature female gametophyte. Notice that the gametophyte develops within the spore. 
			  
		 Two or three archegonia, each with an egg, then develop within the gametophyte. 
			  
		 By the time eggs are ready to be fertilized, two sperm cells have developed in the male gametophyte (pollen grain), and the pollen tube has extended to the female gametophyte. Fertilization occurs when one of the sperm nuclei, injected into an egg cell by the pollen tube, unites with the egg nucleus. All the eggs in an ovule may be fertilized, but usually only one zygote develops into an embryo. 
			  
		 The pine embryo, the new sporophyte, has a rudimentary root and several embryonic leaves. A food supply, consisting of the female gametophyte, surrounds and nourishes the embryo. The ovule has developed into a pine seed, which consists of an embryo (new sporophyte), its food supply (derived from gametophyte tissue), and a surrounding seed coat derived from the integuments of the parent tree (parent sporophyte). Notice that three plant generations--one gametophyte and two sporophyte generations--are represented in a gymnosperm seed.

The pine tree is a sporophyte. Its sporangia are located on scalelike sporophylls that are packed densely in structures called cones. The female gametophyte generation develops from haploid spores that are retained within the sporangia. Conifers, like all seed plants, are heterosporous; male and female gametophytes develop from different types of spores produced by separate cones (FIGURE 30.10, p. 606). Each tree usually has both types of cones. Small pollen cones produce microspores that develop into the male gametophytes, or pollen grains. Larger ovulate cones make megaspores that develop into female gametophytes. From the time young cones appear on the tree, it takes nearly three years to produce the male and female gametophytes, bring them together via pollination, and form mature seeds from the fertilized ovules. The scales of the ovulate cone then separate, and the seeds travel on the wind. A seed that lands in a habitable place germinates, its embryo emerging as a pine seedling.

 Systematists are identifying the angiosperm clades

All angiosperms are placed in a single phylum, the phylum Anthophyta (from the Greek antho, flower). If you return to FIGURE 30.4, you'll find a division into different angiosperm lineages that contrasts sharply with what we would have diagrammed three years ago. Until the late 1990s, most plant taxonomists divided the angiosperms into two main classes, the monocots and the dicots, which differ in several anatomical and morphological details. For example, most monocots have leaves with veins running parallel (think of a grass blade), while most dicots have netlike venation in their leaves (think of an oak leaf). A combination of molecular systematics and cladistic analysis has upheld the monocots as a monophyletic group--a clade. Examples of monocots are lilies, orchids, yuccas, palms, and grasses, including lawn grasses, sugar cane, and grain crops (corn, wheat, rice, and others). However, comparisons of DNA revealed that not all plants having the dicot type of anatomy fall into a single monophyletic group. One clade, the eudicots, does include the majority of dicots. Examples of eudicots are roses, peas, buttercups, sunflowers, oaks, and maples. But some of the other dicots actually belong to angiosperm lineages that diverged earlier than the origin of either monocots or eudicots. For example, the branch in FIGURE 30.4 labeled "other early angiosperm lines" includes a dicot called the star anise. And the water lilies belong to an even older angiosperm lineage. But the oldest angiosperm branch of all is represented by a single species, Amborella trichopoda (FIGURE 30.11b).

(c) Water lilies, such as this Nymphaea carulea, are modern members of a clade predated only by the Amborella lineage. (d) Other early angiosperm lineages include species such as this Illicium floridanum, or star anise. (e) This orchid (Paphiopedilum furheyo) is an example of a monocot. There are about 65,000 species of monocots. (f) The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) is just one of 165,000 species of eudicots.

Amborella was an unlikely candidate to become the center of attention among biologists interested in plant phylogeny. A small shrub with tiny flowers and tiny fruit, Amborella is found only on New Caledonia, a South Pacific island. In 1999, four independent research teams published evidence that Amborella is the most "primitive" known angiosperm--primitive in the sense that the molecular evidence places it on the oldest branch of angiosperm evolution. A plant most botanists didn't know existed a few years ago has become a focal point in research efforts to trace the evolution of flowering plants.

What evolutionary "innovations" contributed most to the enormous success of angiosperms? Refinements in vascular tissue, especially xylem, probably played a role in the spread of angiosperms into diverse terrestrial habitats. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are equipped with xylem cells called tracheids. These are long, tapered cells that function in both mechanical support and water transport (FIGURE 30.12). In addition to these tracheids, the xylem of angiosperms also has fiber cells, which are specialized for support. A third type of xylem cell, called a vessel element, is also found in most angiosperms. Compared to tracheids, vessel elements are shorter and wider, and they are arranged end-to-end into continuous tubes--xylem vessels--that are more efficient than tracheids in transporting water. Amborella has tracheids, but not vessels, suggesting that true vessel elements evolved in angiosperms after Amborella branched off as a distinct lineage.

Whatever roles evolutionary refinements in vascular tissue and other structural characteristics played in plant history, it was probably the reproductive adaptations associated with flowers and fruits that contributed most to making angiosperms so successful.





 The flower is the defining reproductive adaptation of angiosperms

The flower is an angiosperm structure specialized for reproduction. In many angiosperms, insects and other animals transfer pollen from one flower to female sex organs on another flower, which makes pollination less random than the wind-dependent pollination of most gymnosperms. However, some flowering plants are wind-pollinated, a characteristic especially common for plants that occur in dense populations, such as grasses and tree species in temperate forests.

A flower is a specialized shoot with four circles of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (FIGURE 30.13). Starting at the bottom of the flower are the sepals, which are usually green. They are modified leaves that enclose the flower before it opens (think of a rosebud). Above the sepals are the petals, brightly colored in most flowers. They aid in attracting insects and other pollinators. Flowers that are wind-pollinated generally lack bright-colored parts. The sepals and petals are sterile floral parts, meaning that they are not directly involved in reproduction. Within the ring of petals are the fertile sporophylls, the leaf-derived parts that produce spores. The two rings of sporophylls are the stamens and carpels. Stamens are the male reproductive organs, the sporophylls that produce microspores that give rise to male gametophytes. Carpels are the female sporophylls, the organs that make megaspores and their products, female gametophytes. A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a terminal sac, the anther, where pollen is produced. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that receives pollen. A style leads to the ovary at the base of the carpel. Protected within the ovary are the ovules, which develop into seeds after fertilization.

Recall that the enclosure of seeds within the ovary is one of the features that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms. The carpel probably evolved from a seed-bearing leaf (sporophyll) that became rolled into a tube (FIGURE 30.14). Some angiosperms, such as garden peas, have flowers with single carpels. Others, such as magnolias, have several separate carpels. Still other species, such as lilies, have two or more fused carpels, usually forming an ovary with multiple ovule-containing chambers.

Fig 30-14. Hypothesis for the origin of the carpel from a reproductive leaf (sporophyll). The enclosure of ovules (and seeds) within an ovary may have resulted from the rolling of leaves bearing megasporangia on their margins. A similar process may have trans formed sporophylls with microsporangia into the anthers of stamens.





 Fruits help disperse the seeds of angiosperms

A fruit is a mature ovary. As seeds develop from ovules after fertilization, the wall of the ovary thickens. A pea pod is an example of a fruit, with seeds (mature ovules, the peas) encased in the ripened ovary (the pod) (FIGURE 30.15). Fruits protect dormant seeds and aid in their dispersal.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-15. Relationship between a pea flower and a fruit (pea pod). At the same time that the ovules are transformed into seeds, the ovary and other flower parts are transformed into a fruit we call a pod.

Various modifications in fruits help disperse seeds (FIGURE 30.16). Some flowering plants, such as dandelions and maples, have seeds within fruits that function like kites or propellers, adaptations that enhance dispersal by wind. However, many angiosperms use animals to carry seeds. Some of these plants have fruits modified as burrs that cling to animal fur (or to the clothes of humans). Other angiosperms produce edible fruits. Such fruits are usually nutritious, often sweet-tasting, and commonly vividly colored, which advertises their ripeness to certain animals. When it eats the fruit, the animal digests the fleshy part, but the tough seeds usually pass unharmed through the digestive tract. Mammals and birds may deposit seeds, along with a supply of fertilizer, miles from where the fruit was eaten.

The fruit begins to develop after pollination triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to grow (see FIGURE 30.15). The wall of the ovary becomes the pericarp, the thickened wall of the fruit. As the ovary grows, the other parts of the flower wither away in many plants. If a flower has not been pollinated, fruit usually does not develop, and the entire flower withers and falls away.

Fruits are classified into several types, depending on their developmental origin (TABLE 30.1, p. 610). A fruit derived from a single ovary is called a simple fruit. A simple fruit may be fleshy, such as a cherry, or dry, such as a soybean pod. An aggregate fruit, such as a blackberry, results from a single flower that has several carpels. A multiple fruit, such as a pineapple, develops from an inflorescence, a group of flowers tightly clustered together. When the walls of the many ovaries start to thicken, they fuse together and become incorporated into one fruit.

By selectively breeding plants, humans have capitalized on the production of edible fruits. The apples, oranges, and other fruits in grocery stores are exaggerated versions of much smaller natural varieties of fleshy fruits. However, the staple foods for humans are the dry, wind-dispersed fruits of grasses, which are harvested while still on the parent plant. The cereal grains of wheat, rice, corn, and other grasses are easily mistaken for seeds, but each is actually a fruit with a dry pericarp that adheres tightly to the seed coat of the single seed within.

Interactions with animals that transport pollen and seeds have helped angiosperms become the most successful plants on Earth. However, as we will see, the angiosperm life cycle was not an evolutionary "invention," but was built upon adaptive themes we have tracked in our study of plant diversity.





 The life cycle of an angiosperm is a highly refined version of the alternation of generations common to all plants

Angiosperms are heterosporous, a characteristic they share with all seed plants. The flower of the sporophyte produces microspores that form male gametophytes and megaspores that form female gametophytes (FIGURE 30.17). The immature male gametophytes are contained within pollen grains, which develop within the anthers of stamens. Each pollen grain has two haploid cells. Ovules, which develop in the ovary, contain the female gametophyte, also known as the embryo sac. It consists of only a few cells, one of which is the egg. (We'll describe the development of pollen and the embryo sac in more detail in Chapter 38.) Notice that the evolutionary trend toward reduction of the gametophyte generation in vascular plants continued with the angiosperms.

		 zygotes develop into sporophyte embryos that are packaged along with food into seeds. (The fruit tissues surrounding the seed are omitted in this diagram.) When a seed germinates, the embryo grows and develops into a sporophyte.

After its release from the anther, the pollen is carried to the sticky stigma at the tip of a carpel. Although some flowers self-pollinate, most have mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination, the transfer of pollen from flowers of one plant to flowers of another plant of the same species. In some cases, stamens and carpels of a single flower may mature at different times, or the organs may be so arranged within the flower that self-pollination is unlikely.

The pollen grain germinates (begins growing) after it adheres to the stigma of a carpel. The pollen grain, now containing a mature male gametophyte, extends a tube that grows down within the style of the carpel. After it reaches the ovary, the pollen tube penetrates through the micropyle, a pore in the integuments of the ovule, and discharges two sperm cells into the female gametophyte (embryo sac). One sperm nucleus unites with the egg, forming a diploid zygote. The other sperm nucleus fuses with the two nuclei in the large center cell of the female gametophyte. This central cell now has a triploid (3n) nucleus. This phenomenon, known as double fertilization, is characteristic of angiosperms. (Double fertilization also evolved independently in some gymnosperms of phylum Gnetophyta.)

After double fertilization, the ovule matures into a seed. The zygote develops into a sporophyte embryo with a rudimentary root and either one or two seed leaves, the cotyledons (monocots have one seed leaf and dicots have two, hence their names). The triploid nucleus in the center of the embryo sac divides repeatedly, giving rise to a triploid tissue called endosperm, rich in starch and other food reserves. Monocot seeds such as corn store most of their food in the endosperm. Beans and many other dicots transfer most of the nutrients from the endosperm to the developing cotyledons.

What is the function of double fertilization? According to one hypothesis, double fertilization synchronizes the development of food storage in the seed with development of the embryo. If a particular flower is not pollinated or sperm cells are not discharged into the embryo sacs, fertilization does not occur and neither embryo nor endosperm forms. Perhaps double fertilization is an adaptation that prevents flowering plants from squandering nutrients on infertile ovules.

The seed consists of the embryo, endosperm, sporangium, and a seed coat derived from the integuments (outer layers of the ovule). An ovary develops into a fruit as its ovules develop into seeds. After being dispersed by wind or animals, a seed germinates if environmental conditions are favorable. The coat ruptures and the embryo emerges as a seedling, using the food stored in the endosperm and cotyledons.





 The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era

Earth's landscapes changed dramatically with the origin and radiation of flowering plants. The ancestry of angiosperms is still uncertain, but, as discussed earlier, cladistic analysis of gene-sequence data points to Amborella and water lilies such as Nymphaea as the closest living relatives of early angio sperms (see FIGURE 30.11). The oldest fossils that are widely accepted as angiosperms are found in rocks of the early Cretaceous period that are about 130 million years old. In such rock strata, angiosperms are sparsely represented among a much greater abundance of ferns and gymnosperms. By the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, following a period of environmental disturbance, the angiosperms had radiated and become the dominant plants on Earth, as they are today. The change in fossils during the late Cretaceous is so extreme that geologists use the end of that period as the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.





 Angiosperms and animals have shaped one another's evolution

Ever since they colonized the land, animals have influenced the evolution of terrestrial plants, and vice versa. The fact that animals must eat affects the natural selection of both animals and plants. For instance, with animals crawling and foraging for food on the forest floor, natural selection must have favored plants that kept their spores and gametophytes far above ground, rather than dropping these crucial structures to within reach of hungry animals on the ground. This, in turn, may have been a selection factor in the evolution of flying insects. On the other hand, as plants with flowers and fruits evolved, some herbivores became beneficial to the plants by carrying the pollen and seeds of plants they used as food. Certain animals became specialists at these tasks, feeding on specific plants. Natural selection reinforced these interactions, for they improved the reproductive success of both partners: The plant got pollinated and the animal got fed. The mutual evolutionary influence between two species is termed coevolution. (This definition is refined in Chapter 53.)

Pollinator-plant relationships are partly responsible for the diversity of flowers (FIGURE 30.18, p. 612). In most cases, relationships between plants and their pollinators are less specific than in the extreme coevolution between one plant species and one animal species. For example, the flowers of a particular plant species may be adapted for attracting insects rather than birds, but many different insect species may serve as pollinators. Conversely, a single animal species--a honeybee species, for example--may pollinate many different plant species. But even in these less specific relationships, flower color, fragrance, and structure often reflect specialization for a particular taxonomic group of pollinators, such as diverse species of bees or hummingbirds.

Fig 30-18. Flower-pollinator relationships. (a) Scottish broom flower and honeybee. This honeybee is harvesting pollen and nectar (a sugary solution secreted by flower glands) from a Scottish broom flower. The flower has a tripping mechanism that arches the stamens over the bee and dusts it with pollen, some of which will rub off onto the stigma of the next flower the bee visits. (b) Floral tubes and hummingbird. The long, thin beak and tongue of this rufous hummingbird enable the animal to probe flowers that secrete nectar deep within floral tubes. Before the hummer leaves, anthers will dust its beak and head feathers with pollen. Many flowers that are pollinated by birds are red or pink, colors to which bird eyes are especially sensitive. (c) Fragrance and nighttime pollinators. Some angiosperms, such as this baobab tree, depend mainly on nocturnal pollinators, including bats. Common adaptations of such plants include large, light-colored, highly fragrant flowers that nighttime pollinators can locate.

Relationships between angiosperms and animals are also evident in the edible fruits of angiosperms, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Again, we see that one of the keys to angiosperm success has been interaction with animals.





 Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms

A visit to the produce section of a market is a colorful reminder that even city folk depend on farms. Flowering plants provide nearly all our food. All of our fruit and vegetable crops are angiosperms. Corn, rice, wheat, and the other grains are grass fruits. The endosperm of the grain seeds is the main food source for most of the people of the world and their domesticated animals. We also grow angiosperms for fiber, medications, perfumes, and decoration.

Like other animals, early humans probably collected wild seeds and fruits. Agriculture was gradually developed as humans began sowing seeds and cultivating plants to have a more dependable food source. As they domesticated certain plants, such as the squash represented by the seed in the photo that introduced this chapter, humans began to intervene in plant evolution by selective breeding designed to improve the quantity and quality of the foods the crops produced. Agriculture is a unique kind of evolutionary relationship between plants and animals.





 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource

The exploding human population and its demand for space and natural resources are extinguishing plant species at an unprecedented rate. The problem is especially critical in the tropics, where more than half the human population lives and population growth is fastest. Tropical rain forests are being destroyed at a frightening pace. The most common cause of this destruction is slash-and-burn clearing of the forest for agricultural use. Fifty million acres, an area about the size of the state of Washington, are cleared each year, a rate that would completely eliminate Earth's tropical forests within 25 years. As the forest disappears, so do thousands of plant species. Extinction is irrevocable; plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource. Insects and other rain forest animals that depend on these plants are also vanishing. In all, researchers estimate that the destruction of habitat in the rain forest and other ecosystems is claiming hundreds of species each year. The toll is greatest in the tropics, because that is where most species live; but environmental assault is a generically human tendency. Europeans eliminated most of their forests centuries ago, and habitat destruction is endangering many species in North America (FIGURE 30.19).

(b) Slash-and-burn clearing of a tropical rainforest in the Amazon Basin to provide temporary farmland that will become unproductive in just a few years because of depletion of soil nutrients.

Many people have ethical concerns about contributing to the extinction of living forms. But there are also practical reasons to be concerned about the loss of plant diversity. We depend on plants for thousands of products, including food, building materials, and medicines. TABLE 30.2 lists only a few examples of how we use the unique secondary compounds of plants (see p. 582 to review secondary compounds). So far, we have explored the potential uses of only a tiny fraction of the 250,000 known plant species. For example, almost all our food is based on the cultivation of only about two dozen species. More than 25%  of prescription drugs are extracted from plants, and many more medicinal compounds were first discovered in plants and then synthesized artificially. However, researchers have investigated fewer than 5,000 plant species as potential sources of medicine. Pharmaceutical companies were led to most of these species by local people who use the plants in preparing their traditional medicines.

TABLE 2.2, p. 37.The tropical rain forest may be a medicine chest of healing plants that could be extinct before we even know they exist. This is only one reason to value what is left of plant diversity and to search for ways to slow the loss. The solutions we propose must be economically realistic. If the goal is only profit for the short term, then we will continue to slash and burn until the forests are gone. If, however, we begin to see rain forests and other ecosystems as living treasures that can regenerate only slowly, we may learn to harvest their products at sustainable rates. What else can we do to preserve plant diversity? Few questions are as important.
