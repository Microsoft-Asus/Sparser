The biggest obstacle facing Goo Goo Dolls lead singer Johnny Rzeznik is n't how to follow up 1998 's multiplatinum `` Dizzy Up the Girl . ''
Nor it is having to sing `` Iris , '' the group 's breakthrough hit from the film `` City of Angels , '' one more time .
And it is n't the lack of privacy that has come with whirlwind fame .
Right now , Rzeznik 's biggest problem is trying to weave his way through Los Angeles traffic .
`` I 've got to change lanes here .
I 've got to make a U -turn '' Rzeznik said as he called from L.A. , where he was on his way to a rehearsal for the band 's three-show tour in South Africa , which took place a few weeks ago .
`` I hate this city , I 'm telling you . ''
The road to MTV and Top 40 radio has been equally circuitous for the Goo Goo Dolls , whose first incarnation was in the early ' 80s as the Sex Maggots .
After a promoter urged the band to change its name , the Goo Goo Dolls signed with Celluloid Records in 1985 , only to bow out of the agreement quickly .
`` It 's a stupid name , '' Rzeznik said of the loopy label , which was inspired by an ad in the back of a True Detective magazine for a doll with a moveable rubber head .
`` We got a record deal , so we had to kind of stick with the same name .
By the time 1995 rolled around , everybody sort of knew who we were .
It would have been unwise to change the name at that point .
I begged those guys ; I lost that argument . ''
The group landed a new deal with Metal Blade Records , an offshoot of Warner Bros. , and that relationship proved equally disheartening .
The Goo Goo Dolls became entangled in a nine-month legal battle with Metal Blade after the release of 1995 's `` A Boy Named Goo , '' claiming they had n't been fairly compensated .
A new deal was negotiated with Warner Bros .
The drama continued when Rzeznik and bassist Robby Takac fired drummer George Tutuska in 1995 over long-simmering disagreements .
Current drummer Mike Malinin was called in just a few weeks later .
The group scored a few hits early in its career , but 1998 's `` Dizzy Up the Girl '' was an unprecedented success , thanks in part to `` Iris . ''
The song 's placement on the `` City of Angels '' soundtrack , coupled with the film 's success , has made it the biggest hit of the Goo Goo Dolls ' career .
`` I did n't think anybody would ever hear that song .
Here I am on a record with Peter Gabriel and Alanis Morissette and U2 and whoever else was on there -- just huge , huge , huge bands , '' Rzeznik said .
`` That was a lot of traffic to get through , but it happened , and it was great .
I 'm very happy about that . ''
`` Dizzy Up the Girl '' is the band 's sixth album , and it showcases a sweeter , more accessible sound .
The album has sold more than 3 million copies .
A fourth single from it -- `` Broadway '' -- was released March 28 .
`` I was hoping that the record would do well , of course , but I did n't think it was going to do as well as it has , '' Rzeznik said .
`` Things just evolve .
I sort of have no control over what happens with the songs .
Sometimes I 'm afraid I might wake up one morning with an entire record of polka songs . ''
Rzeznik has already been writing for the band 's next album , but no release date has been set .
`` It 's 10 seconds of inspiration and 10 months of being annoyed and having to do the day-to-day pounding of actually hammering into it , '' Rzeznik said .
`` It 's all so tentative right now .
It 's hard to even say what the heck it 's going to wind up being . ''
Rzeznik has used his new visibility to branch into other areas of interest .
He was a guest on `` Politically Incorrect '' and has hosted programs on MTV and VH1 .
He 's also writing music for a Disney project and for `` some people I respect a lot and grew up listening to their records and really loved them . ''
-LRB- He would n't get more specific than that . -RRB-
With stardom comes the inevitable focus on the band 's leader , and Rzeznik is definitely one of rock 's reluctant cover boys -- the kind with carefully mussed hair , body-clinging clothes and tattoos .
Rzeznik seems unfazed -- and almost amazed -- at the heartthrob label .
`` Believe me , brother , that 's a temporary status that I 'm having right now .
I do n't put much stock in it , '' Rzeznik said .
`` It makes me a little uncomfortable because I 've never thought of myself like that , and I do n't know if that 's something I particularly want to be .
There 's a very quick shelf life for heartthrobs .
I want people to hear our music . ''
Anyone who has experienced the Goo Goo Dolls live knows that this is no batch of prepackaged pretty boys .
The group balances every mainstream-radio moment with a gritty rock anthem .
It 's a nice surprise and , for the band , a necessity .
`` That 's the way it 's always got to be , man .
Listen to the first three Kiss records , and then listen to it live , '' Rzeznik said .
`` If you ca n't rock as hard as you do on the records , that 's just weak .
There 's no excuse . ''
