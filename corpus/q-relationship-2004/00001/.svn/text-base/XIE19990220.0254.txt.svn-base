MOSCOW , February 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russia 's lower house of parliament on Friday unleashed a fierce attack on NATO 's new strategic doctrine .
In a statement addressed to parliaments of the member states of the United Nations , the Russian State Duma lambasted NATO attempts to bypass the United Nations in world affairs .
The Duma said the new doctrine , representing a major revision to the transatlantic alliance 's strategy , will have a bearing on the security interests of all the countries in the world .
It stressed that the new NATO doctrine is in essence intended to annul the United Nations ' leading role in safeguarding world peace and that such a doctrine might threaten the role of the world body and all existing systems of international relations .
The statement warned that NATO 's new strategy might lead to the weakening of the effectiveness of such regional organizations as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
It said that the authority to sanction the use of force should not rest with certain clique of states and that the United Nations should continue to be the unique body that can ensure world stability .
