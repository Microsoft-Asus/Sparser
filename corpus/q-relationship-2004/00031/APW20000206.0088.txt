AMMAN , Jordan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Queen Noor gets a little less of the limelight in Jordan now that she is no longer first lady .
But she still enjoys the advantages of being a queen and the mother of Prince Hamzeh , the 20-year -old heir to the Hashemite Throne .</ENAMEX>
Noor , 48 , is widely popular among Jordanians who watched her puffy-eyed vigil at the bedside of a gravely ill King Hussein before his death from cancer last Feb. 7 .
`` I am no longer the wife of the head of state , '' Noor said in a recent CNN interview .
`` But the rest of the details and how I am referred to ... has n't changed . ''
`` I am simply Queen Noor , my husband 's wife and widow .
And in Jordan , I remain for many people an extension of him , a part of him . ''
The American -born Lisa Halaby of Washington D.C. adopted the name Noor al- Hussein , or light of Hussein , when she converted to Islam before her marriage .
She was instrumental in forging warm ties with the United States and ending Jordan 's international ostracism for its perceived tilt toward Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
These days , the queen leads seminars at home and abroad on issues such as ridding the world of mines , child care and combating drug abuse and violence against women .
She is often seen visiting indigent Jordanian families or inspecting state-financed social projects in remote villages of the kingdom , sometimes with Queen Rania , the wife of King Abdullah II .
There had been speculation that Noor had ruffled family feathers by grooming her son , Hamzeh , for the throne that for 34 years was reserved for Hussein 's younger brother , Prince Hassan .
But days before his death , Hussein deposed Hassan and appointed Abdullah as his successor .
When he became king , Abdullah named Hamzeh as his heir .
In public gatherings , Noor is seen kissing , hugging , chatting and laughing with Abdullah and other family members .
In state functions , she is usually seated next to Abdullah and his wife .
People close to the royal family say Noor and Abdullah visit each other often .
Noor lives in a home on Amman 's outskirts that she moved to with Hussein in 1998 , called Bawabet as- Salam , or the Gate of Peace Palace .
Hamzeh lives with Noor along with his two sisters -- Princess Iman , 17 , and Princess Raiyah , 14 .
His brother , Prince Hashim , 19 , is now studying at Britain 's Sandhurst military academy .
