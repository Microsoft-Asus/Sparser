VIENNA , Austria --
After watching oil prices triple over the last year to their highest level since the Persian Gulf war , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is groping toward agreement on a modest increase in production .
But OPEC ministers preparing for a crucial meeting here Monday still appeared divided Friday on the extent and timetable of any production increases despite intense lobbying by the United States , where soaring gasoline prices have created a political uproar .
It is widely expected that OPEC ministers , who control about 40 percent of the world 's oil supply , will agree to increase production .
But few outside experts think the increase will be big enough to cause more than modest price reductions at the gasoline pump .
Officials from Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest producer and the most powerful OPEC member , have quietly endorsed the goal of reducing oil prices to about $ 25 a barrel from its peak on March 8 of $ 34 .
Indeed , OPEC production is already running more than 1 million barrels a day over its stated limit of 23 million barrels , and most experts believe the bulk of this extra oil is coming from Saudi Arabia .
Since March 8 , the benchmark market price for oil has dropped about 18 percent and as of Friday it was trading at about $ 28 a barrel .
Much of that reflects an expectation among oil traders that OPEC will raise production by about 1.5 million barrels a day .
It also reflects an unofficial increase in production that has already occurred .
But even if oil does settle at about $ 25 a barrel , analysts say that would probably knock only a few pennies off the price of gasoline in the United States , where a gallon of unleaded regular costs an average of $ 1.60 .
In the meantime , countries like Iran and Libya are still fighting against a big production increase and their positions have hardened in recent days .
`` OPEC is divided , '' said Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , Indonesia 's oil minister , to reporters in Jakarta on Friday .
`` I think it 's going to be a heated debate during the meeting . ''
With oil officials already descending on Vienna 's Intercontinental Hotel on Friday , the stakes and the uncertainties about Monday 's meeting are high .
`` The only thing we know is that OPEC is going to increase production , '' said Peter Ginoux , who oversees petroleum trading at Salomon Smith Barney in London .
`` We do n't know how much of an increase .
We do n't know how it will be divided between countries and we do n't know the timing . ''
It was OPEC 's surprisingly unified and disciplined decision to cut daily production by 2.1 million barrels last March that sent prices soaring and ignited protests from American drivers and politicians .
In the U.S. House of Representatives , lawmakers passed a largely symbolic bill this past week that would require the Clinton administration to determine whether OPEC nations are colluding to fix prices , and to punish any deemed to be doing so .
There is also growing pressure on President Clinton to provide relief by selling oil from the federal government 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Bill Richardson , the secretary of energy , has waged an intensive lobbying campaign with the leaders of oil-producing countries , and spent much of this past week meeting with officials in Norway , Nigeria , Algeria and the United Arab Emirates .
U.S. officials have been pushing for an increase of as much as 2.5 million barrels a day , the amount that oil analysts believe is necessary to stabilize prices at about $ 25 and allow oil companies to rebuild their depleted reserves .
Saudi officials are believed to support an increase of about 1.5 million barrels a day , and they appear to have support from countries like Venezuela and Mexico .
Though Mexico is not a member of OPEC , it joined in last year 's production cut and is a formidable producer .
But analysts say the real issue is not the nominal increase in the amount that countries pledge to produce .
More important is whether those increases come on top of the current cheating on restrictions .
If oil-exporting countries increase their formal commitments by 2 million barrels a day but eliminate the roughly 1 million barrels a day in noncompliance , the net increase would be only about 1 million barrels and its market impact would be limited .
`` The biggest question is how they handle compliance , '' said Gary N. Ross , chief executive of PIRA Energy Group , a petroleum industry consulting firm .
`` How much do they raise the pledge volume , and does noncompliance come down as a result ? ''
Robert Priddle , executive director of the International Energy Agency , a Paris -based research group , estimated that world output would need to increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day just to bring supply back in line with demand .
Oil producers are understandably anxious , having experienced both an unnerving plunge in prices and an almost equally unexpected ricochet back up -- all in the last two years .
The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis , which deeply depressed demand for oil , and a Saudi decision to step up production helped contribute to a supply glut in 1998 that pushed prices down to about $ 11 a barrel , inflicting severe financial pain on OPEC nations and other big exporters .
Analysts estimate that the decline cost OPEC nations $ 65 billion in revenue .
The severity of that crisis finally imposed discipline on OPEC nations , particularly chronic cheaters like Venezuela , and persuaded non- OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway to join in with production cuts last year .
Now prices have shot up even more dramatically than they declined two years ago , leaving consumers as well as producers almost shell-shocked by the turbulence .
`` They have never really been in this situation before , '' remarked Paul Horsnell , assistant director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Oxford , England .
`` This is the first time they have ever had to add more than a million barrels a day on the market in a coordinated way . ''
The last time prices shot up so much was during the Persian Gulf war , when oil producers cranked up their output to compensate for the cut-off from Iraq and Kuwait .
But that case was simpler , because all producers simply produced as much as they could .
Iran 's OPEC governor , Hossein Kazempour Ardebili , said on Thursday he had become more skeptical about production increases in the price retreat since the March 8 peak .
`` Two weeks ago it may have been justified to call on OPEC to increase production , '' Ardebili said .
`` But now we have a different situation in that during the past three to four days oil prices have fallen by $ 4 to $ 5 and this is expected to continue . ''
Ross , of PIRA Energy Group , argued that OPEC has extraordinary leverage at the moment because production growth has been slow in non- OPEC areas and global economic growth is accelerating .
A 1 percent increase in global economic growth increases oil demand by an estimated 700,000 barrels a day .
`` The momentum is with OPEC , '' said Ross .
