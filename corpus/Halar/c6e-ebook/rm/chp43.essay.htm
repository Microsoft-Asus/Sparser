									<a name="para148"></a><p class="BlockText">You know that gamma interferon has many effects on cells, one of which is to increase the number of class I MHC molecules on the cell surface. You have prepared a supply of gamma interferon using recombinant DNA technology, and you want to test it on laboratory animals with (a) virus infections and (b) cancers. Considering the multiple activities of gamma interferon, what predictions would you make about its effects on the animals' immune response against (a) virus-infected cells and (b) cancer cells?</p>

									<a name="para150"></a><p class="BlockText">Until a vaccine became available, poliomyelitis (polio) was one of the most feared diseases, resulting in paralysis when the virus destroyed motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Currently, both a live, attenuated oral and an injectable, inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine are available. The ease of administration has made the oral vaccine more popular, and it is generally credited with controlling the disease worldwide. However, the live virus may mutate to the more virulent form. In any given year approximately ten people in the United States contract vaccine-associated paralytic polio. Of those cases, the majority are in individuals who were healthy when immunized or who came into contact with someone recently vaccinated. Statistically, the probability of contracting vaccine-associated polio remains low, 1 in 12 million. Do you feel the risk is acceptable when compared to the benefits of oral vaccination? How might public health decisions of this type be made?</p>
