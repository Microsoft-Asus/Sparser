LOS ANGELES
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Officers in the police precinct at the heart of a massive corruption scandal had federal immigration agents deport at least 160 suspected gang members and witnesses to police abuse , the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday .
The Rampart Division 's elite anti-gang unit violated a 21-year -old policy by seeking the deportations , the Times reported , citing senior Immigration and Naturalization Service officials .
Rafael Perez , the former officer whose allegations started the scandal , told investigators that witnesses to police abuse would be deported at the instigation of the CRASH unit , which stands for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums .
Other deportees were on a list of 10,000 supposed members of the violent 18th Street gang in California and other states , the Times said .
Perez 's allegations that Rampart CRASH officers beat , framed and shot innocent people have led to the suspension of 20 officers and reversal of 40 criminal convictions .
On Wednesday , the FBI announced it had joined the investigation , while the state attorney general 's office said it would expand its own review of the ongoing LAPD investigation .
According to the latest allegations , anti-gang officers in 1997 and 1998 repeatedly sought the deportation of Hispanic immigrants who did not appear to be gang members , the Times said .
`` I told my boss this was just ludicrous .
They were targeting a whole race of people , '' a senior INS agent said was quoted as saying in the Times .
`` That 's not a gang anymore , that 's a culture .
They only wanted to do one thing : sweep the street and turn the bodies over to the INS . ''
At least 160 whose names were turned over to the INS 's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force were deported , and about 40 received prison sentences for re-entering the country illegally , the Times said , citing an INS agent .
INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said Thursday the agency 's internal auditors will look into the allegations .
Capt. Bob Hansohn , Rampart 's commanding officer , said Thursday that he not seen any such deportation activity since he took over in August 1998 with a mandate to clean up the division .
He never heard of a gang list of 10,000 people , he added .
