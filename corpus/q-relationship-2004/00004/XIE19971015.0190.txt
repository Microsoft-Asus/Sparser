ANKARA , October 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iraq 's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- has confirmed that Turkish warplanes bombed its area in northern Iraq , local newspaper Daily News reported today .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The bombardments took place Monday while Turkish jets attacked Turkey 's outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- rebels in the area</ENAMEX> , Shazad Saib , a senior official at the PUK Ankara office , was quoted as saying .
In one incident , several PUK positions were hit by the bombs dropped by Turkish warplanes , Saib said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Late last month , around 15,000 Turkish troops , backed by air and artillery fire , launched a cross-border incursion in northern Iraq in a bid to destroy newly-built PKK camps</ENAMEX> .
Turkey started to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq early Monday , leaving some units in the area to prevent a possible comeback of the rebels , according to media reports .
Saib stressed that the PUK expects Turkey to take a neutral stance in northern Iraq , indicating that Ankara helps the Kurdistan Democratic Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- led by Massoud Barzani in their fightings against the PKK. The KDP has been fighting against both the PUK and PKK in northern Iraq after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein lost control of the area due to a crushing defeat in the 1991 Gulf War .
The PUK , which allegedly gains support from Iran and maintains a relaxed relationship with the PKK , vows to topple the Saddam regime through armed struggle .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">However , the KDP , backed by both Baghdad and Ankara , has been wrestling with its main rival PUK for the control of northern Iraq and has also been fighting alongside with Turkish troops in the area against the PKK rebels over the past several months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Turkey had repeatedly accused Tehran and Damascus of supporting the PKK , vowing to eradicate the Kurdish separatists with force</ENAMEX> .
Ankara has frequently launched cross-border operations aimed at wiping out the PKK militants in northern Iraq .
Saib had denied earlier that the PUK was sheltering the PKK rebels in northern Iraq , describing as `` baseless '' media reports that the PKK militants , escaping Ankara 's offensive , had been taking refuge in PUK -controlled area .
The PUK , KDP and representatives from Turkey , Britain and the United States , three sponsors for the northern Iraq issue , met in London last week to discuss the situation in northern Iraq , but failed to achieve any positive results .
