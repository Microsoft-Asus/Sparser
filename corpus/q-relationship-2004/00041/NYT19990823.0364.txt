WASHINGTON_
Congress is close to forcing a major expansion of economic sanctions against international narcotics traffickers and the businesses that work with them .
Legislation to impose such sanctions on drug criminals throughout the world passed the Senate easily late last month .
After initially opposing the measures on both practical and foreign policy grounds , administration officials have now begun to work with legislators to fashion a bill that both the House and the president could support .
But while such measures have some support among businessmen and government officials in Colombia -- the only country where the United States has used them -- they are being strongly opposed by the government of Mexico and a few of that country 's biggest companies .
`` The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed profound concern about the negative consequences that may arise from the implementation of such a proposal , '' Mexico 's ambassador to Washington , Jesus Reyes Heroles , wrote on July 27 in a confidential letter to the White House drug-policy director , Gen. Barry McCaffrey .
The sanctions would bar drug traffickers and their associates from doing business in the United States , cut off their access to American banks and freeze any assets they may have deposited here .
American firms that continue to work with companies linked to the traffickers would be subject to civil and criminal prosecution .
President Clinton first levied such penalties in 1995 against the four main leaders of Colombia 's Cali drug cartel .
In a subsequent letter to Congress , he promised , `` I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their violent and corrupting activities as long as these measures are appropriate . ''
Since then , the Treasury Department , which administers the sanctions , has built a list of almost 500 relatives , associates and mostly Colombian companies linked to the traffickers .
More than two dozen of those companies have ended up liquidating their assets , officials said , while others have had to reorganize or change their names .
But Clinton administration officials have hesitated almost from the start of the program to extend it to drug criminals in other countries , and particularly to those in Mexico .
In part , their concerns have been practical : Before acting against the Cali cartel , U.S. officials had been able to analyze reams of the group 's secret business records that had been seized in raids by Colombian police teams backed by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA .
By contrast , the most powerful Mexican drug mafias are believed to have hidden their wealth in mazes of front companies , aliases and associates that the American authorities have not yet been able to penetrate .
One CIA effort to dig into the possible drug connections of one of Mexico 's most prominent business dynasties ended after an intelligence agent in Mexico was threatened while trying to search public records , officials said .
More importantly , perhaps , some senior administration officials have also worried about the political and economic impact that the sanctions might have on a country that is the United States ' second-most-important trading partner , officials said .
`` There are parts of this government that are very nervous about doing anything like this with Mexico , '' one senior State Department official said .
`` There is no question that it will raise the tension level some , and there are always some people who think it may undermine confidence in the economy . ''
If finally approved , the legislation that passed the Senate on July 21 and a similar bill pending in the House would essentially force the administration to do what it has done with Colombia on a global scale .
So far , that action has been taken by executive order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , the law that has been used to freeze the assets of and stop Americans from doing business with the governments of Gen. Manuel Noriega in Panama and the Islamic revolutionaries who held Americans hostage in Iran .
By Jan. 1 , 2000 , and by every year thereafter , the legislation would require the secretary of the Treasury to submit a list of major international drug traffickers after consulting with the CIA and the departments of Justice , Defense and State .
That list would then be vetted by the White House drug-policy director and forwarded to the president .
By March 1 , the president would have to produce a final list of traffickers to be sanctioned , as well as a report to Congress explaining his reasons if he has decided to leave off any of the accused traffickers suggested by his aides .
The legislation would freeze the assets of the traffickers and any companies that they may partly own or control and prohibit American businesses from working with them .
It would also cover the American assets of any person or company that aids a trafficker 's illicit activities .
As a practical matter , the annual publication of such lists would probably only be the start of an elaborate process of investigation , congressional and administration officials said .
The Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control now has only about six or eight officials assigned full time to implementing the sanctions .
Even if new funds are appropriated to pay for the collection of intelligence on the traffickers ' business assets and associates , it could take years to develop evidence strong enough to withstand a challenge in court .
So far , there have been very few such challenges from Colombia .
Two of the teenaged daughters of the Cali cartel chiefs , both of them American citizens , fought successfully to be struck from the list of the traffickers ' known associates .
About 10 others have been removed from the list after severing their ties to the cartel or establishing their innocence , officials said .
A Colombian official who discussed the sanctions on the condition he not be identified said that although the government of President Andres Pastrana supported the American sanctions , it was eager to be more involved in drawing up lists of the traffickers ' associates so as to ensure that innocent businesses were not hurt by being linked to drug trafficking .
Mexican officials and businessmen said they were fighting the legislation in part on similar grounds .
`` If you 're a legitimate company and you 're targeted , you should have a way to defend yourself before you get on the list , '' said Luis Calvillo , a spokesman for one of Mexico 's biggest international transportation companies , Transportacion Maritima Mexicana , or TMM. Both TMM and the Mexican Embassy in Washington have been campaigning strongly for detailed amendments to the legislation , with lobbyists for TMM working to organize a coalition of like-minded American businesses .
The Mexican firm , one of Latin America 's largest shipping companies , has complained that it has been unfairly linked to drug trafficking by U.S. intelligence documents in the past .
In interviews , two Republican sponsors of the sanctions legislation , Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Rep. Porter Goss of Florida , said they would readily consider changes to strengthen the safeguards for law-abiding companies .
But they added that they were confident that the legislation now has enough bipartisan support to win approval .
`` We have suggested for a long time that this be used , '' said Goss , who , like Coverdell , will likely be among the legislators who reconcile the Senate and House bills .
`` The administration would go a little way but they did n't want to go too far .
We got tired of waiting for them . ''
