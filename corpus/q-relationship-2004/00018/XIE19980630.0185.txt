SEOUL , June 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korean President Kim Dae -jung Tuesday directed his cabinet to propose a joint investigation with the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- into the latter 's submarine incident .
A government statement said the joint investigation proposed by the president is designed to identify the cause of the incident .
The directive came from the president after the DPRK accused South Korea of being inhuman in treating the incident which claimed lives of the nine crewmen inside the submarine .
Last Saturday , the DPRK urged South Korea to return the submarine and the corpses of the crewmen and condemned Seoul 's description of the submarine incident as being on an espionage mission .
The DPRK also asked South Korea to shoulder the responsibility for the death of the nine crewmen as it failed to take humanitarian action to rescue the submarine and its crewmen .
On June 22 , a DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean Navy after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet in the East Sea -LRB- Sea of Japan -RRB- , some 18 kilometers off the South Korean city of Solcho .
All nine crewmen aboard were found shot to death or committed suicide when the submarine was opened four days later .
The South Korean military authorities said the DPRK sub incident `` on an espionage mission '' was a clear violation of South Korean waters against the Armistice Agreement signed in 1953 and the South - North basic relations agreement reached in 1992 .
The DPRK , however , claimed that the vessel strayed off course from engine troubles during a routine military exercise .
