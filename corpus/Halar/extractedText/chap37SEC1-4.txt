NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS: SYMBIOSIS OF PLANTS AND SOIL MICROBES

 

 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation results from intricate interactions between roots and bacteria



 

 Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations of roots and fungi that enhance plant nutrition



 

 Mycorrhizae and root nodules may have an evolutionary relationship



The roots of plants belong to subterranean communities that include a diversity of other organisms. Among those organisms are certain species of bacteria and fungi that have coevolved with specific plants, forming symbiotic relationships with roots that enhance the nutrition of both partners. The two most important examples are symbiotic nitrogen fixation (roots and bacteria) and the formation of mycorrhizae (roots and fungi).
