									<a name="para82"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Paramecium</span> and other protists that live in hypotonic environments have cell membrane adaptations that slow osmotic water uptake, while those living in isotonic environments have more permeable cell membranes. What water regulation adaptations would you expect to have evolved in protists living in hypertonic habitats such as Great Salt Lake? How about those living in habitats where salt concentration fluctuates?</p>

									<a name="para84"></a><p class="BlockText">An experiment is designed to study the mechanism of sucrose uptake by plant cells. Cells are immersed in a sucrose solution, and the pH of the solution is monitored with a pH meter. Samples of the cells are taken at intervals, and the sucrose in the sampled cells is measured. The measurements show that sucrose uptake by the cells correlates with a rise in the pH of the surrounding solution. The magnitude of the pH change is proportional to the starting concentration of sucrose in the extracellular solution. A metabolic poison known to block the ability of cells to regenerate ATP is found to inhibit the pH changes in the extracellular solution. Propose a hypothesis accounting for these results. Suggest an additional experiment to test your hypothesis.</p>

									<a name="para86"></a><p class="BlockText">Extensive irrigation in arid regions causes salts to accumulate in the soil. (The water contains low concentrations of salts, but when the water evaporates from the fields, the salts are left behind to concentrate in the soil.) Based on what you have learned about water balance in plant cells, explain why increasing soil salinity (saltiness) has an adverse effect on agriculture. Suggest some ways to minimize this damage. What costs are attached to your solutions?</p>
