Even where we have not completely destroyed a natural system, our actions have disrupted the trophic structure, energy flow, and chemical cycling of ecosystems in most areas of the world. The effects are sometimes local or regional, but the ecological impact of humans can be widespread or even global. For example, acidic gases may be carried by prevailing winds and fall as acid rain hundreds or thousands of miles from the smokestacks emitting the gases.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
