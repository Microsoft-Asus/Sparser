 An animal's diet must supply essential nutrients and carbon skeletons for biosynthesis

In addition to providing fuel for ATP production, an animal's diet must also supply all the raw materials needed for biosynthesis. To build the complex molecules it needs to grow and maintain itself, an animal must obtain organic precursors (carbon skeletons) from its food. Given a source of organic carbon (such as sugar) and a source of organic nitrogen (usually in amino acids from the digestion of protein), animals can fabricate a great variety of organic molecules--carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.

Besides fuel and carbon skeletons, an animal's diet must also supply essential nutrients. These are materials that must be obtained in preassembled form because the animal's cells cannot make them from any raw material (FIGURE 41.3). Some of these materials are essential for all animals, but others are needed only by certain species. For instance, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient for humans and other primates, guinea pigs, and some birds and snakes, but not for most other animals.

Fig 41-3. Obtaining essential nutrients. A giraffe, an herbivore of East Africa, chews on old bones from a dead mammal. Bones contain calcium phosphate, and osteophagia ("bone-eating") is common among herbivores living where soils and plants are deficient in phosphorus. Animals require phosphorus as a mineral nutrient to make ATP, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and bones.

An animal whose diet is missing one or more essential nutrients is said to be malnourished (recall that undernourished refers to caloric deficiency). For example, cattle and other herbivorous animals may suffer mineral deficiencies if they graze on plants growing in soil lacking key minerals (see FIGURE 41.3). Malnutrition is much more common than undernutrition in human populations, and it is even possible for an overnourished individual to be malnourished.

There are four classes of essential nutrients: essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Essential Amino Acids

Animals require 20 amino acids to make proteins, and most animal species can synthesize about half of these, as long as their diet includes organic nitrogen. The remaining ones, the essential amino acids, must be obtained from food in prefabricated form. Eight amino acids are essential in the adult human diet (a ninth, histidine, is essential for infants); the same amino acids are essential for most animals.

A diet that provides insufficent amounts of one or more essential amino acids causes a form of malnutrition known as protein deficiency. This is the most common type of malnutrition among humans. The victims are usually children, who, if they survive infancy, are likely to be retarded in physical and perhaps mental development.

The most reliable sources of essential amino acids are meat, eggs, cheese, and other animal products. The proteins in animal products are "complete," which means that they provide all the essential amino acids in their proper proportions. Most plant proteins are "incomplete," being deficient in one or more essential amino acids. Corn, for example, is deficient in the amino acid lysine. People forced by economic necessity or other circumstances to obtain nearly all their calories from corn would show symptoms of protein deficiency, as would those who eat only rice, wheat, or potatoes. This problem can be avoided by eating a combination of plant foods that complement one another to supply all essential amino acids. For example, beans supply the lysine that is missing in corn; and while beans are deficient in methionine, this essential amino acid is present in corn. Thus, a diet of beans and corn provides all the essential amino acids--as long as these vegetables are both consumed during the same day (FIGURE 41.4). Because the body cannot easily store amino acids, a deficiency of a single essential amino acid, even for a relatively short period, retards protein synthesis and limits the use of other amino acids. Most cultures have, by trial and error, developed balanced diets that prevent protein deficiency.

Some animals have special adaptations that get them through periods when their bodies demand extraordinary amounts of protein. For example, penguins can use their muscle protein as a source of amino acids to make new proteins when they replace their feathers after molting (FIGURE 41.5).

Fig 41-5. Storing protein for growth. Penguins, such as this Ad&eacute;lie from Antarctica, must make an abundance of new protein when they molt (grow new feathers). Penguins replace all their feathers at once during a two- to three-week period. Because of the temporary loss of their insulating coat of feathers, penguins cannot swim--or feed--when molting. What is the source of amino acids for production of feather protein? There is no special storage tissue for free amino acids, but it is possible to store amino acids in certain proteins. Before molting, a penguin greatly increases its muscle mass. The penguin then breaks down the extra muscle protein, which supplies the amino acids for growing new feathers.

Essential Fatty Acids

Animals can synthesize most of the fatty acids they need. The essential fatty acids, the ones they cannot make, are certain unsaturated fatty acids (fatty acids having double bonds; see FIGURE 5.11). In humans, for example, linoleic acid must be present in the diet. This essential fatty acid is required to make some of the phospholipids found in membranes. Most diets furnish ample quantities of essential fatty acids, and thus deficiencies are rare.

Vitamins

Vitamins are organic molecules required in the diet in amounts that are quite small compared with the relatively large quantities of essential amino acids and fatty acids animals need. Tiny amounts of vitamins may suffice--from about 0.01 to 100 mg per day--depending on the vitamin. However, vitamin deficiencies can cause severe problems.

So far, 13 vitamins essential to humans have been identified. They have extremely diverse physiological functions. Vitamins are grouped into two categories: water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins (TABLE 41.1). The water-soluble vitamins include the B complex, which consists of several compounds that generally function as coenzymes in key metabolic processes. Vitamin C, also water-soluble, is required for the production of connective tissue. Excesses of water-soluble vitamins are excreted in urine, and moderate overdoses of these vitamins are probably harmless.

They have a wide variety of functions. Vitamin A is incorporated into visual pigments of the eye. Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption and bone formation. The function of vitamin E is not yet fully understood, but along with vitamin C it seems to protect the phospholipids in membranes from oxidation (you have probably encountered advertisements for dietary supplements containing vitamin E as an "antioxidant.") Vitamin K is required for blood clotting. Excesses of fat-soluble vitamins are not excreted but are deposited in body fat, so overconsumption may result in an accumulation of these compounds to toxic levels.

The subject of vitamin dosage has aroused heated scientific and popular debate. Some believe it is sufficient to meet recommended daily allowances (RDAs), the nutrient intakes proposed by nutritionists to maintain health. Others argue that RDAs are set too low for some vitamins, and a fraction of those people believe, probably mistakenly, that massive doses of vitamins confer health benefits. Research is far from complete, and debate continues, especially over optimal doses of vitamins C and E. At this time, all that can be said with any certainty is that people who eat a balanced diet are not likely to develop symptoms of vitamin deficiency.

Minerals

Minerals are simple inorganic nutrients, usually required in small amounts--from less than 1 mg to about 2,500 mg per day (TABLE 41.2). As with vitamins, mineral requirements vary with animal species. Humans and other vertebrates require relatively large quantities of calcium and phosphorus for the construction and maintenance of bone. Calcium is also necessary for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles, and phosphorus is also an ingredient of ATP and nucleic acids. Iron is a component of the cytochromes that function in cellular respiration (see FIGURE 9.13) and of hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of red blood cells. Magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and molybdenum are cofactors built into the structure of certain enzymes; magnesium, for example, is present in enzymes that split ATP. Vertebrates need iodine to make thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolic rate. Sodium, potassium, and chlorine are important in nerve function and also have a major influence on the osmotic balance between cells and the interstitial fluid.

The average U.S. citizen eats enough salt to provide about 20 times the required amount of sodium. Ingesting an excess of salt or several other minerals can upset homeostatic balance and cause toxic side effects. For example, too much sodium is associated with high blood pressure, and excess iron can cause liver damage.

We now shift our attention to the kinds of foods that animals eat and how they process these foods to meet their nutritional needs.
