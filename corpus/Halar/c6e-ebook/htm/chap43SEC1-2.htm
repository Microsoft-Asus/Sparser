Lymphocytes respond to such contacts by generating efficient and selective immune responses that work throughout the body to eliminate the particular invaders. Keep in mind that the cells of the immune system respond similarly to transplanted cells and even cancer cells, which they detect as foreign.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
