CAIRO , October 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Libya Tuesday changed `` the Voice of the Greater Arab Nation '' into `` the Voice of Africa '' , a move to show resentment against the Arabs , The Middle East News Agency reported .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The change followed the Arab League 's refusal to join rally with the Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- in its rejection of the U.N. -imposed embargo on Libya , including air travel in and out of the country .
Arab foreign ministers meeting here last month said the league will bypass the sanctions when Libya 's demand for a fair trial for the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is met .</ENAMEX>
But before that , it has no such intention .
In the meantime , they support Libya 's right to damages in compensation for human and material losses , sustained as a result of the seven-year U.N. sanctions .
This development is widely viewed by observers as an attempt by the 22-member Arab forum to court back Libya .
Tripoli on September 13 decided to disband its ministry of promoting Arab unity in the coming few weeks , a move revealing its grudge against Arab failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the Afro - Arab country lifted .
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had criticized the league , saying that the African nations , rather than the Arab world , were his only supporters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and Britain fail to make compromise</ENAMEX> .
And since then several African leaders have flown to Tripoli .
