The synapsids included mammal-like reptiles called therapsids, from which mammals evolved. The anapsid lineage is probably totally extinct. Until recently, systematists considered turtles, based on skull anatomy, to be the only surviving anapsids. However, molecular comparisons place the turtles with the diapsids (the dotted branch in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.20</span> represents the still-uncertain ancestry of turtles). The diapsids include most or all (depending on the position of turtles) groups of modern reptiles, as well as a diversity of extinct swimming, flying, and land-based reptiles.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">During the early Mesozoic radiation of amniotes, the diapsid lineage split into two evolutionary branches, the <span class="Emphasis2">lepidosaurs</span> (which include lizards, snakes, and two species of New Zealand animals called tuataras) and the <span class="Emphasis2">archosaurs</span> (which include crocodiles and alligators, dinosaurs, and birds). It’s important to note the position of birds in the amniote phylogeny. Birds are diapsids, specifically members of the archosaur clade. Their closest extant relatives are the crocodiles and alligators, but they are even more closely related to a branch of the extinct reptiles known as dinosaurs. In fact, neither dinosaurs nor reptiles represent monophyletic taxa unless we also include birds.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.21</span> compares the classical classification of the amniotes with three of several alternatives that are based on strict application of cladistic conventions, in which each taxon must represent a monophyletic group. The classical taxonomy (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.21a</span>) divides the amniotes into three classes, Reptilia, Aves (birds), and Mammalia. It is a classification that highlights the distinctive adaptations that evolved in the avian (bird) lineage. However, another look at the cladogram in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.20</span> will reinforce the point made earlier that the traditional class Reptilia is paraphyletic because it does not include the birds. Researchers have proposed various cladistics-based alternatives for placing the birds in the taxonomy of amniotes. These options illustrate an enduring difference of taxonomic preference, between "lumpers," who prefer to minimize the number of taxa at each taxonomic level, and "splitters," who prefer a finer-grained taxonomy having more taxa at each level. In the most extreme lumpers’ version of amniote classification, the bird problem is solved by simply including birds in the class Reptilia (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.21b</span>). In one splitters’ version, class Aves is preserved by also granting class status to other clades of reptiles (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.21c</span>, which includes only extant groups). Another alternative identifies the two major diapsid branches as taxonomic classes, Lepidosauria and Archosauria (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.21d</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-21','../fig/big/fig34-21.jpg','fig34-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-21.jpg" alt="fig34-21" name="myfig34-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Taxonomic classes of amniotes.</span> Many zoologists prefer the classical taxonomy, which is pragmatic, though it breaks from the strict cladistic requirement that named taxa must be monophyletic groups.
