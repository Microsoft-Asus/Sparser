Topic: prophase

input paragraph:
from www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/mitosisig/prophase.html
(by Pearson)

The page has this summary before its animation:

"During prophase, chromosomes become visible,
 the nucleolus disappears, the mitotic spindle forms,
 and the nuclear envelope disappears."

Then each of these sentences is a bullet point:

"Chromosomes become more coiled and can be viewed
 under a light microscope.

 Each duplicated chromosome is seen as a pair of
 sister chromatids joined by the duplicated but unseparated
 centromere.  

 The nucleolus disappears during prophase.
 In the cytoplasm, the mitotic spindle, consisting of
 microtubules and other proteins, forms between the
 two pairs of centrioles as they migrate to
 opposite poles of the cell.

 The nuclear envelope disappears at the end of
 prophase.

 This signals the beginning of the substage
 called prometaphase."
