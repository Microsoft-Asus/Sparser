Chapter 40: AN INTRODUCTION TO ANIMAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY: AN OVERVIEW

   Animal form and function reflect biology's major themes

   Function correlates with structure in the tissues of animals

   The organ systems of an animal are interdependent



BODY PLANS AND THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

   Physical laws constrain animal form

   Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment



REGULATING THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

   Mechanisms of homeostasis moderate changes in the internal environment

   Homeostasis depends on feedback circuits



INTRODUCTION TO THE BIOENERGETICS OF ANIMALS

   Animals are heterotrophs that harvest chemical energy from the food they eat

   Metabolic rate provides clues to an animal's bioenergetic "strategy"

   Metabolic rate per gram is inversely related to body size among similar animals

   Animals adjust their metabolic rates as conditions change

   Energy budgets reveal how animals use energy and materials

It is natural for us to be curious about how our bodies work. In these chapters on animal form and function, you will indeed learn much about human anatomy and physiology. But the scope of this unit of chapters is not limited to humans or even to vertebrates. The study of animal form and function is integrated by the common set of problems that all animals must solve. How, for example, do animals as different as hydras, halibut, and humans obtain oxygen from their environments? How do they nourish themselves? excrete waste products? move? Our main goal in this unit of chapters is to see how animals of diverse evolutionary history and varying complexity solve these general challenges of life. This chapter introduces the unit with some unifying concepts that apply across the animal kingdom.
