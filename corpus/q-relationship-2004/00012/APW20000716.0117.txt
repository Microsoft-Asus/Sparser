SHIRLEY , N.Y .
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Families and friends of the victims of the TWA Flight 800 explosion broke ground for a new memorial Sunday on the Long Island shore not far from where the plane went down four years ago killing all 230 people on board .
About 50 families , from as far away as Australia , were joined by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , Gov. George Pataki and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater , who attended on behalf of President Clinton .
`` For the family members , it was an extremely emotional time -- this is something they have wanted for a long time , '' said memorial project spokesman Frank Lombardi .
`` It 's a special place .
It brings them as close as they can to their family members . ''
A private ceremony was scheduled for Monday , the anniversary of the crash .
Organizers have raised about half the money needed for the $ 1.5 million project , which they hope to have built by next summer .
The centerpiece for the memorial will be a 12-foot granite wall with the names of the victims .
Surrounding the wall will be a contemplative garden , which Lombardi described as a series of private areas for people to sit and reflect about the crash .
The plane had just left New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport for Paris on July 17 , 1996 , when an explosion sent it plummeting into the ocean .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Investigators determined the explosion occurred in the Boeing 747 's center fuel tank , but theories have persisted that flashes seen in the sky seconds before the explosion may have been a missile .</ENAMEX>
The National Transportation Safety Board plans to meet next month to go over reports and evidence from the crash and determine a final cause .
