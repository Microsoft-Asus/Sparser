They secrete <span class="Emphasis2">parathyroid hormone (PTH),</span> which raises blood levels of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and thus has an effect opposite to that of the thyroid hormone calcitonin. A lack of PTH causes blood levels of calcium to drop dramatically, leading to convulsive contractions of the skeletal muscles. If unchecked, this condition, known as tetany, is fatal. Calcium ions, in appropriate concentration, are essential to the normal functioning of all cells.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">PTH raises the level of blood Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> by direct and indirect effects on bone and kidney. In bone, PTH induces specialized cells called osteoclasts to decompose the mineralized matrix of bone and release Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> to the blood. In the kidneys, PTH has two effects: It stimulates reabsorption of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> through the renal tubules, and it activates the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. An inactive form of <span class="Emphasis2">vitamin D,</span> a steroid-derived molecule, is obtained from food or synthesized in the skin and then activated sequentially in the liver and the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D functions as a hormone. It acts in concert with PTH in bone, and it also affects the intestines, where it stimulates the uptake of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> from food. For hormonal action, vitamin D binds to receptors in the nuclei of target cells and regulates gene transcription.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">When blood calcium rises above a certain level, calcitonin comes into play. It has effects on bone and kidneys opposite to those of PTH and thus decreases blood Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>. The control of blood calcium level is an example of how homeostasis is often maintained by the balancing of two antagonistic hormones--in this case, PTH and calcitonin. In classic feedback fashion, these two hormones balance each other’s effects, thereby minimizing fluctuations in the concentration of calcium in the blood (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 45.9</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig45-9','../fig/big/fig45-9.jpg','fig45-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig45-9.jpg" alt="fig45-9" name="myfig45-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 45-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Hormonal control of calcium homeostasis in mammals.</span> A negative feedback system involving two antagonistic hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH), maintains the concentration of calcium in blood very close to 10 mg/100mL. A rise in blood Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> induces the thyroid gland to secrete calcitonin, which lowers the Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> concentration by increasing bone deposition and reducing reabsorption in the kidneys. (By interfering with PTH, the calcitonin also helps reduce Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uptake by the intestines, not shown.) These effects are reversed by PTH, which is secreted from the parathyroid glands when the concentration of blood Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> falls below the set point. Blood calcium levels begin to increase as target cells in the bones and kidneys respond to PTH. In addition to stimulating Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uptake in these organs directly, PTH also acts indirectly by helping activate vitamin D in the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D then stimulates the intestines to increase Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uptake from food. But blood Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> will rise only so far before the thyroid counters by secreting more calcitonin.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
