-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- DISCOVER DIALOGUE : JUST LET HER FLY Shannon Lucid , a biochemist and NASA astronaut , holds the record for the most hours in orbit by a woman .
In 1996 she was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President Clinton , the only woman so honored .
For six months aboard Russia 's Mir space station in 1996 , she grew wheat , monitored gestating quail eggs and studied how fluids be have in space .
At NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston , where she helps train crews for the International Space Station , she had this to say : Q : What inspired you as a child to become a scientist ?
A : I wanted to know everything about the world around me .
I decided to become a chemist when I read that water was composed of oxygen and hydrogen .
I could not understand how two gases made a liquid .
Q : What is your fantasy career ?
A : To be a great writer .
Q : What do you think is the biggest problem facing the world today ?
A : The widening gulf between the haves and the have nots .
The people who have access to resources get more and more , and the people who do n't are getting less and less .
Q : What are you reading now ?
A : `` A Peoples Tragedy : The Russian Revolution 1891-1924 , '' a book by Orlando Figes .
Q : If you could visit another planet , which would it be ?
A : Mars , because it 's similar to Earth in a lot of respects , except that as far as I know it does n't have life .
Also , there 's a reasonable chance that you can go there someday .
Q : What is your greatest fear ?
A : To have nothing to read .
Q : Did you take any books to Mir ?
A : I read about 50 books while I was up there , including several by Dickens -- among them `` David Copperfield '' and `` Bleak House . ''
Q : What else did you do to relax ?
A : We joked .
And I liked watching Earth as the daylight passed .
Q : If you could redesign the human body , what would you add ?
A : Wings .
Q : If you were able to travel back in time , what era would you choose ?
A : Right now is the best time for a woman to live .
SPINAL CORD CURE ?
Unlike broken bones or torn ligaments , injured spinal cords never heal .
`` It 's one of the great mysteries of neurobiology , '' says Richard Borgens of Purdue University .
Such nerve damage invariably causes permanent paralysis , a grim prognosis that Borgens , a neurobiologist , hopes to change .
He and physiologist Riyi Shi have managed to restore some function to the crushed spinal cords of guinea pigs .
The researchers treated the guinea pigs with a chemical called polyethylene glycol , applying it directly to the crushed parts of the animals ' spinal cords .
The chemical attracts water molecules and dehydrates membranes of nerve cells .
Without water , the proteins in the membranes cluster together , `` like soldiers closing ranks , '' Borgens says .
This clustering seals tears at a cellular level and fuses damaged cells together .
After a few minutes , Borgens adds water to the cells , restoring the membranes to normal .
Early results have been promising : Of the dozens of guinea pigs tested , all regained some sensation and motor control .
`` Human trials , '' Borgens says , `` could begin in a couple of years . ''
DEATH FLARES Yale astronomer Bradley Schaefer has some interesting news for those of us who live on Earth .
He recently discovered that several nearby stars that closely resemble our sun can become violent , shooting off flares powerful enough to fry a planet more than a billion miles away .
`` These things are 100 to 10 million times larger than the biggest solar flares ever seen , '' Schaefer says .
A quirk of cosmic architecture apparently saves us from such fires .
Schaefer 's Yale colleague Eric Rubenstein theorizes that the magnetic field of a large planet orbiting close to a star may cause the flares .
The planet 's field could become entangled with the star 's own magnetic field .
When the twisted fields snap apart , the stored energy is released in one tremendous burst , creating what Rubenstein and Schaefer call a superflare .
The planet closest to our sun is tiny Mercury , which has a very weak magnetic field .
But if Jupiter occupied Mercury 's orbit , we 'd be in trouble .
Schaefer says Jupiter would then be in a position to trigger a gargantuan flare that would turn winter into summer on Earth and strip away the atmosphere 's protective ozone layer .
`` Ultraviolet radiation would bathe the entire globe , causing the food chain to die from the bottom up , '' he says .
`` I would n't want to be around . ''
WHY NASA SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE YOU GO NASA has 10 centers scattered across the country : Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif. : Ames conducts wind-tunnel tests and astrobiology research -- the study of what life might be like on other worlds .
Moffett Federal Airfield and the Software Independent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont , West Va. -- are Ames subsidiaries .
Dryden Flight Research Center , Edwards , Calif. : develops everything from unmanned planes for environmental monitoring to next-generation launch vehicles .
Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. : the birthplace of Sojourner , Cassini , Galileo and most other unmanned NASA space vehicles , JPL specializes in the robotic exploration of space .
The labs network of bases in the Mojave Desert , Spain and Australia communicate with spacecraft .
Johnson Space Center , Houston : mission control , where astronauts train in a giant pool to simulate spacewalking .
JSC coordinates the development of the International Space Station .
The White Sands Test Facility , in Las Cruces , N.M. , is part of JSC. Lewis Research Center , Cleveland : specializes in and subsonic-engine design .
John F. Kennedy Space Center , Cape Canaveral , Fla. : receives all the different pieces of a spacecraft , readies them for takeoff , and launches them .
