In most species, behavioral adaptations ensure that a male is present when the female releases eggs. Here, a female frog, clasped by a male (on top), has just released a mass of eggs. The male released sperm (not shown) at the same time, and external fertilization has already occurred in the surrounding water.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
