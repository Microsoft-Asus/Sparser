Living organisms are distinguished by their ability to reproduce their kind. Like begets like. Only oak trees produce oaks, and only elephants can make more elephants. Furthermore, offspring resemble their parents more than they do less closely related individuals of the same species. The transmission of traits from one generation to the next is called inheritance, or heredity (from the Latin heres, heir). Along with inherited similarity, there is also variation: Offspring differ somewhat in appearance from parents and siblings. These observations have been exploited for the thousands of years that people have bred plants and animals. Curiosity about human similarities and differences is just as ancient. The photo on this page illustrates similarities and differences in Gwyneth Paltrow's family. The mechanisms of heredity and variation, however, eluded biologists until the development of genetics in the twentieth century.

Genetics, the scientific study of heredity and hereditary variation, is the subject of this unit. Here you will learn about genetics at the levels of organism, cell, and molecule. You will find out how geneticists are helping answer age-old questions about life, including the mystery of how multicellular animals and plants arise from a single cell, the fertilized egg. And you will learn that genetic methods and discoveries are catalyzing progress in every other biological field, including physiology, evolutionary biology, ecology, and even behavior. On the practical side, you will learn how modern genetics is revolutionizing medicine and agriculture. Finally, you will consider some social and ethical questions raised by our ability to manipulate DNA, the genetic material. In this chapter, we begin our study of genetics by examining how chromosomes pass from parents to offspring in sexual reproduction.

How do we account for the genetic variation we observed in FIGURE 13.2? We are now ready to address this question.





 Offspring acquire genes from parents by inheriting chromosomes

Family friends may tell you that you have your mother's freckles, even though she still has hers. Parents do not, in any literal sense, give their children freckles, eyes, hair, or any other traits. What, then, actually is inherited? Parents endow their offspring with coded information in the form of hereditary units called genes. The tens of thousands of genes we inherit from our mothers and fathers constitute our genome. Our genetic link to our parents accounts for family resemblance. Your genome may include a gene for freckles, which you inherited from your mother. Our genes program the specific traits that emerge as we develop from fertilized eggs into adults.

Genes are segments of DNA. You learned in Chapters 1 and 5 that DNA is a polymer of four different kinds of monomers called nucleotides. Inherited information is passed on in the form of each gene's specific sequence of nucleotides, much as printed information is communicated in the form of meaningful sequences of letters. Language is symbolic. The brain translates words and sentences into mental images and ideas; for example, the object you imagine when you read "apple" looks nothing like the word itself. Analogously, cells translate genetic "sentences" into freckles and other features with no resemblance to genes. Most genes program cells to synthesize specific enzymes and other proteins, and it is the cumulative action of these proteins that produces an organism's inherited traits. The programming of these traits in the form of DNA is one of the unifying themes of biology.

The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed along from parents to offspring. In animals and plants, the cellular vehicles that transmit genes from one generation to the next are sperm and ova (unfertilized eggs). After a sperm cell unites with an ovum (a single egg), genes from both parents are present in the nucleus of the fertilized egg.

Except for tiny amounts of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts, the DNA of a eukaryotic cell is subdivided into chromosomes within the nucleus. Every living species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. For example, humans have 46 chromosomes in almost all of their cells. Each chromosome consists of a single long DNA molecule elaborately coiled in association with various proteins. One chromosome includes hundreds or thousands of genes, each of which is a specific part of the DNA molecule. A gene's specific location along the length of a chromosome is called the gene's locus (plural, loci). Our genetic endowment consists of whatever genes happened to be part of the chromosomes we inherited from our parents.





 Like begets like, more or less: a comparison of asexual and sexual reproduction

Strictly speaking, "Like begets like" applies only to organisms that reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single individual is the sole parent and passes copies of all its genes to its offspring. For example, single-celled eukaryotic organisms can reproduce asexually by mitotic cell division, in which DNA is copied and allocated equally to two daughter cells. The genomes of the offspring are virtually exact copies of the parent's genome. Some multicellular organisms are also capable of reproducing asexually. Hydra, a relative of the jellyfishes, can reproduce by budding (FIGURE 13.1). Because the cells of the bud were derived by mitosis in the parent, the "chip off the old block" is usually genetically identical to its parent. Occasional genetic differences are due to relatively rare changes in the DNA called mutations, which we will discuss in Chapter 17. An individual that reproduces asexually gives rise to a clone, a group of genetically identical individuals.

Fig 13-1. The asexual reproduction of a hydra. This relatively simple multicellular animal reproduces by budding. The bud, a localized mass of mitotically dividing cells, develops into a small hydra, which detaches from the parent (LM).

Sexual reproduction results in greater variation than does asexual reproduction; two parents give rise to offspring that have unique combinations of genes inherited from the two parents. In contrast to a clone, offspring of sexual reproduction vary genetically from their siblings and both parents: "Like begets like" only in the general sense of family resemblance. Genetic variation like that shown in FIGURE 13.2 (p. 236) is an important consequence of sexual reproduction. What mechanisms generate this genetic variation? The key is the behavior of chromosomes during the sexual life cycle.

 Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles

We begin with a familiar example--the human life cycle--and use it to introduce some basic terms.

The Human Life Cycle

In humans, each somatic cell--any cell other than a sperm or ovum--has 46 chromosomes. With a light microscope, condensed (mitotic) chromosomes can be distinguished from one another by their appearance. The sizes of chromosomes and the positions of their centromeres differ. When chromosomes are stained with certain dyes, each chromosome also has a distinctive pattern of colored bands.

Careful examination of a micrograph of the 46 human chromosomes reveals that there are two of each type. This becomes clear when images of the chromosomes are arranged in pairs, starting with the longest chromosomes. The resulting display is called a karyotype (FIGURE 13.3). The chromosomes that make up a pair--that have the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern--are called homologous chromosomes, or homologues. The two chromosomes of each pair carry genes controlling the same inherited characters. For example, if a gene for eye color is situated at a particular locus on a certain chromosome, then the homologue of that chromosome will also have a gene specifying eye color at the equivalent locus.

Fig 13-3. Preparation of a human karyotype. Karyotypes, ordered displays of an individual's chromosomes, are often prepared using lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. The cells are treated with a drug to stimulate mitosis and are then grown in culture for several days. Another drug is then added to arrest mitosis at metaphase, when the chromosomes, each consisting of two joined sister chromatids, are highly condensed and easy to identify in the microscope. The figure above outlines the further steps in the preparation of the karyotype. Karyotyping can be used to screen for abnormal numbers of chromosomes or defective chromosomes associated with certain congenital disorders, such as Down syndrome. (The causes and effects of chromosomal disorders are discussed in Chapter 15.)

There is an important exception to the rule of homologous chromosomes for human somatic cells: the two distinct chromosomes referred to as X and Y. Human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes (XX), but males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Only small parts of the X and Y are homologous; most of the genes carried on the X chromosome do not have counterparts on the tiny Y, and the Y has genes lacking on the X. Because they determine an individual's sex, the X and Y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes. The other chromosomes are called autosomes.

The occurrence of homologous pairs of chromosomes in our karyotype is a consequence of our sexual origins. We inherit one chromosome of each pair from each parent. So the 46 chromosomes in our somatic cells are actually two sets of 23 chromosomes--a maternal set (from our mother) and a paternal set (from our father).

Sperm cells and ova are different from somatic cells in chromosome count. Each of these reproductive cells, or gametes, has a single set of the 22 autosomes plus a single sex chromosome, either X or Y. A cell with a single chromosome set is called a haploid cell. For humans, the haploid number, abbreviated n, is 23 (n = 23).

By means of sexual intercourse, a haploid sperm cell from the father reaches and fuses with a haploid ovum of the mother. This union of gametes is called fertilization, or syngamy. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, contains the two haploid sets of chromosomes bearing genes representing the maternal and paternal family lines. The zygote and all other cells having two sets of chromosomes are called diploid cells. For humans, the diploid number of chromosomes, abbreviated 2n, is 46 (2n = 46).

As a human develops from a zygote to a sexually mature adult, the zygote's genes are passed on with precision to all somatic cells of the body by the process of mitosis. Thus, somatic cells, like the zygote from which they are derived, are diploid.

The only cells of the human body not produced by mitosis are the gametes, which develop in the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). Imagine what would happen if human gametes were made by mitosis: They would be diploid like the somatic cells. At the next round of fertilization, when two gametes fused, the normal chromosome number of 46 would double to 92, and each subsequent generation would double the number of chromosomes yet again. But sexually reproducing organisms carry out a process that halves the chromosome number in the gametes, compensating for the doubling that occurs at fertilization. This process is a form of cell division called meiosis, and in animals it occurs only in the ovaries or testes. While mitosis conserves chromosome number, meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. As a result, human sperm and ova each have a haploid set of 23 different chromosomes, one from each homologous pair. Fertilization restores the diploid condition by combining two haploid sets of chromosomes, and the human life cycle is repeated, generation after generation (FIGURE 13.4).

Fig 13-4. The human life cycle. In each generation, the doubling of chromosome number that results from fertilization is offset by the halving of chromosome number that results from meiosis. For humans, the number of chromosomes in a haploid cell is 23 (n = 23); the number of chromosomes in the diploid zygote and all somatic cells arising from it is 46 (2n = 46).

In general outline, the human life cycle is typical of many animals. Indeed, the processes of fertilization and meiosis are the unique trademarks of sexual reproduction. Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles, offsetting each other's effects on the chromosome number and thus perpetuating a species' chromosome count.

The Variety of Sexual Life Cycles

Although the alternation of meiosis and fertilization is common to all organisms that reproduce sexually, the timing of these two events in the life cycle varies, depending on the species. These variations can be grouped into three main types of life cycles (FIGURE 13.5). The human life cycle is an example of one type, characteristic of most animals. Gametes are the only haploid cells. Meiosis occurs during the production of gametes, which undergo no further cell division prior to fertilization. The diploid zygote divides by mitosis, producing a multicellular organism that is diploid (FIGURE 13.5a).

Fig 13-5. Three sexual life cycles differing in the timing of meiosis and fertilization (syngamy). The common feature of all three cycles is the alternation of these two key events, which contribute to genetic variation among offspring.

A second type of life cycle occurs in most fungi and some protists, including some algae. After gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, meiosis occurs before offspring develop. This meiosis produces not gametes but haploid cells that then divide by mitosis to give rise to a haploid multicellular adult organism. Subsequently, the haploid organism produces gametes by mitosis, rather than by meiosis. The only diploid stage is the zygote (FIGURE 13.5b). (Note that either haploid or diploid cells can divide by mitosis, depending on the type of life cycle. Only diploid cells, however, can undergo meiosis.)

Plants and some species of algae exhibit a third type of life cycle called alternation of generations. This type of life cycle includes both diploid and haploid multicellular stages. The multicellular diploid stage is called the sporophyte. Meiosis in the sporophyte produces haploid cells called spores. Unlike a gamete, a spore gives rise to a multicellular individual without fusing with another cell. A spore divides mitotically to generate a multicellular haploid stage called the gametophyte. The haploid gametophyte makes gametes by mitosis. Fertilization results in a diploid zygote, which develops into the next sporophyte generation. In this type of life cycle, therefore, the sporophyte and gametophyte generations take turns reproducing each other (FIGURE 13.5c).

Though the three types of sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis and fertilization, they share a fundamental result: Each cycle of chromosome halving and doubling contributes to genetic variation among offspring. A closer look at meiosis will reveal the sources of this variation.





 Meiosis reduces chromosome number from diploid to haploid: a closer look

Many of the steps of meiosis closely resemble corresponding steps in mitosis. Meiosis, like mitosis, is preceded by the replication of chromosomes. However, this single replication is followed by two consecutive cell divisions, called meiosis I and meiosis II. These divisions result in four daughter cells (rather than the two daughter cells of mitosis), each with only half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Study the overview of meiosis in FIGURE 13.6, and be sure you understand the difference between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids. The two chromosomes of a homologous pair are individual chromosomes that were inherited from different parents. Homologues appear alike in the microscope, but they have different versions of genes at some of their corresponding loci (for example, a gene for freckles on one chromosome and a gene for the absence of freckles at the same locus on the homologue).

Fig 13-6. Overview of meiosis: how meiosis reduces chromosome number. After the chromosomes replicate once, the diploid cell divides twice, yielding four haploid daughter cells. This overview tracks just one pair of homologous chromosomes, which for the sake of simplicity are drawn in the condensed state throughout (they would not normally be condensed during interphase). Homologues in this and later figures are colored red and blue to remind you that they carry different versions of some genes.

The behavior of the chromosomes is emphasized by the use of red and blue to differentiate the members of each homologous pair. For a discussion of the spindle and other features common to mitosis and meiosis, see Chapter 12.

Mitosis and Meiosis Compared

Now that you have followed chromosomes through meiosis in FIGURE 13.7, let's summarize the key differences between meiosis and mitosis. The chromosome number is reduced by half in meiosis but not in mitosis. The genetic consequences of this difference are important. Whereas mitosis produces daughter cells genetically identical to their parent cell and to each other, meiosis produces cells that differ genetically from their parent cell and from each other.

FIGURE 13.8 compares the key steps of mitosis and meiosis. Although meiosis involves two cell divisions, three events that are unique to meiosis all occur during the first of the divisions, meiosis I:

Fig 13-8. A comparison of mitosis and meiosis. (In this chapter, we consider prophase to include prometaphase.)

During prophase I of meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes pair with their homologues, a process called synapsis. For part of prophase I, a protein "zipper"--the synaptonemal complex--holds the homologous chromosomes tightly together all along their lengths. When the synaptonemal complex disappears in late prophase, the four closely associated chromatids of a homologous pair are visible in the light microscope as a tetrad. Also visible in the light microscope are X-shaped regions called chiasmata (singular, chiasma). They represent a crossing of nonsister chromatids, which are two chromatids belonging to separate but homologous chromosomes. Chiasmata are the physical manifestations of a genetic rearrangement called crossing over, discussed in the next section. Neither synapsis nor chiasma formation occurs during mitosis.

At metaphase I of meiosis, homologous pairs of chromosomes, rather than individual chromosomes, align on the metaphase plate.

At anaphase I of meiosis, sister chromatids do not separate, as they do in mitosis. Rather, the two sister chromatids of each chromosome remain attached and go to the same pole of the cell. Meiosis I separates homologous pairs of chromosomes, not sister chromatids of individual chromosomes.

The second meiotic division, meiosis II, separates sister chromatids and is virtually identical in mechanism to mitosis. However, since the chromosomes do not replicate between meiosis I and meiosis II, the final outcome of meiosis is a halving of the number of chromosomes per cell--a reduction from two haploid sets to one haploid set in each cell.





 Sexual life cycles produce genetic variation among offspring

In species that reproduce sexually, the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization is responsible for most of the variation that arises each generation. Let's examine three mechanisms that contribute to the genetic variation arising from sexual reproduction: independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over, and random fertilization.

Independent Assortment of Chromosomes

One way sexual reproduction generates genetic variation is shown in FIGURE 13.9, which features meiosis of a diploid cell with two homologous pairs of chromosomes. The red and blue colors distinguishing the maternal and paternal chromosomes of each homologous pair allow us to track individual chromosomes as meiosis proceeds and they are packaged in gametes. At metaphase I, the homologous pairs of chromosomes, each consisting of one maternal and one paternal chromosome, are situated on the metaphase plate. The orientations of the homologous pairs relative to the poles of the cell are random; there are two alternative possibilities for each pair. Thus, there is a fifty-fifty chance that a particular daughter cell of meiosis I will get the maternal chromosome of a certain homologous pair and a fifty-fifty chance that it will receive the paternal chromosome.

Fig 13-9. The results of alternative arrangements of two homologous chromosome pairs on the metaphase plate in meiosis I. In this figure we consider the consequences of meiosis in a hypothetical organism with a diploid chromosome number of 4 (2n = 4). The parental origins of the chromosomes are designated with different colors, blue for chromosomes inherited from one parent, red for chromosomes from the other parent. The positioning of each homologous pair of chromosomes at metaphase I is a matter of chance and determines which chromosomes will be packaged together in the haploid daughter cells.

Because each homologous pair of chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I--its orientation is as random as the flip of a coin--the first meiotic division results in independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes into daughter cells. Each gamete represents one outcome of all possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes. The number of combinations possible for gametes formed by meiosis starting with two homologous pairs of chromosomes (2n = 4, n = 2) is four, as shown in FIGURE 13.9. (Only two of the four combinations of gametes shown in the figure would result from meiosis of a single diploid cell, but starting with a large number of diploid cells, gametes of all four types would be produced in approximately equal numbers.) In the case of n = 3, eight combinations of chromosomes are possible for gametes. More generally, the number of combinations possible when chromosomes assort independently into gametes during meiosis is 2n, where n is the haploid number of the organism.

In the case of humans, the haploid number (n) in the formula is 23. Thus, the number of possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes is 223, or about 8 million. The variety of gametes is analogous to the different combinations of heads and tails possible for the simultaneous tossing of 23 coins. Thus, each gamete that a human produces contains one of roughly 8 million possible assortments of chromosomes inherited from that individual's mother and father.

Crossing Over

As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents. But from what you have learned so far, it would seem that each individual chromosome in a gamete would be exclusively maternal or paternal in origin; that is, it would consist of DNA derived from our mother or father, but not from both. In fact, this is not the case. The process called crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, which combine genes inherited from our two parents (FIGURE 13.10).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 13-10. The results of crossing over during meiosis. During prophase of meiosis I, nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange corresponding segments. Following these chromosomes through meiosis, we can see that crossing over gives rise to recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that have some combination of DNA originally derived from two different parents.

Recent research has revealed that crossing over begins very early in prophase I, as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths and before the synaptonemal complex forms between them. The pairing is precise, the homologues aligning with each other gene by gene. In crossing over, homologous portions of two nonsister chromatids trade places. (For humans, an average of two or three such crossover events occur per chromosome pair.) After the synaptonemal complex disappears, the locations where these genetic exchanges have occurred are visible as chiasmata.

At metaphase II, chromosomes that contain one or more recombinant chromatids can be oriented in two alternative, nonequivalent ways with respect to other chromosomes, because their sister chromatids are no longer identical twins. The independent assortment of these nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II increases still more the number of genetic types of gametes that can result from meiosis.

You will learn more about crossing over in Chapter 15. The important point for now is that crossing over, by combining DNA inherited from two parents into a single chromosome, is an important source of genetic variation in sexual life cycles.

Random Fertilization

The random nature of fertilization adds to the genetic variation arising from meiosis. Consider a zygote resulting from a mating between a woman and a man. A human ovum, representing one of approximately 8 million possible chromosome combinations, is fertilized by a single sperm cell, which represents one of 8 million different possibilities. Thus, even without considering crossing over, any two parents will produce a zygote with any of about 64 trillion (8 million &#160;X&#160; 8 million) diploid combinations. (If you calculate 223&#160;X&#160; 223 exactly, you will find that the total is actually over 70 trillion.) Adding in the variation brought about by crossing over, the number of possibilities is truly astronomical. No wonder brothers and sisters can be so different. You really are unique.

So far, we have seen that there are three sources of genetic variability in a sexually reproducing population of organisms:

Independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I (and of nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II)

Crossing over between homologous chromosomes during prophase of meiosis I

Random fertilization of an ovum by a sperm

All three mechanisms reshuffle the various genes carried by the individual members of a population. However, as you will learn in subsequent chapters, mutations are what ultimately create a population's diversity of genes.





 Evolutionary adaptation depends on a population's genetic variation

Having considered how sexual reproduction contributes to genetic variation in a population, we can relate these concepts to evolution, biology's core theme. Darwin recognized the importance of genetic variation in the evolutionary mechanism he called natural selection. Recall from Chapter 1 that a population evolves through the differential reproductive success of its variant members. On average, those individuals best suited to the local environment leave the most offspring, transmitting their genes in the process. This natural selection results in adaptation, the accumulation of the genetic variations favored by the environment. As the environment changes or a population moves, the population may survive if, in each generation, at least some of its members can cope effectively with the new conditions. Different genetic variations may work better than those that prevailed in the old time or place. Sex and mutations are the two sources of this variation, and we have considered the sexual contribution in this chapter.

Although Darwin realized that heritable variation is what makes evolution possible, he could not explain why offspring resemble--but are not identical to--their parents. Ironically, Gregor Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin, published a theory of inheritance that helps explain genetic variation, but his discoveries had no impact on biologists until 1900, more than 15 years after Darwin (1809-1882) and Mendel (1822-1884) had died. In the next chapter, you will learn how Mendel discovered the basic rules governing the inheritance of specific traits.
