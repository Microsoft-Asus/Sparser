PTERIDOPHYTES: SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves



 

 A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants



 

 Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants



 

 Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period



The two phyla of seedless vascular plants represented in the modern flora are the phylum Lycophyta (lycophytes) and phylum Pterophyta (ferns, whisk ferns, and horsetails). These two phyla probably had separate origins from different ancestors among the early vascular plants. Thus, the term "pteridophyte" is an informal one for all seedless vascular plants, while "Pterophyta" is the formal name for one seedless plant phylum, the ferns and their relatives. FIGURE 29.21 illustrates examples of pteridophytes.

Fig 29-21. Examples of pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). The phyla Lycophyta and Pterophyta probably evolved from different ancient vascular plants. Based on recent evidence that whisk ferns, horsetails, and ferns make up a monophyletic group of seedless vascular plants, many plant systematists now place them all in the single phylum Pterophyta. All of the plants illustrated here are sporophytes, the dominant forms in the life cycles of all vascular plants.
