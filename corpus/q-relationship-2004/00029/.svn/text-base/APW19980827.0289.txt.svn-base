<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A suspect in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi has been flown from Kenya to the United States</ENAMEX> , a U.S. official said Thursday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The suspect , Khalid Salim , believed to be a Yemeni citizen , was being flown to New York</ENAMEX> , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The Nairobi command post of the FBI , which has about 200 agents in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing , refused to comment on the status of Salim and other suspects , as did Kenyan police .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The powerful blast at the embassy , believed to have been caused by a car bomb , killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000 .
A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , killed 11 people</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an unspecified number of people for questioning in the bombing</ENAMEX> .
But no list of detainees has been made public and no charges have been announced .
Under Kenyan law , people held in connection with capital crimes must be formally charged within 14 days .
The exact date of Salim 's arrest was not known , but <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">another suspect , Mohammed Saddiq Odeh , has been held by Kenyan authorities</ENAMEX> since Aug. 14 , a week after his arrest in Karachi , Pakistan .
Kenya and the United States have an extradition treaty , but it only comes into play if one of the countries is seeking a suspect the other does not wish to give up .
Local newspapers refer to Odeh , who is said to be either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994 , as the prime suspect in the bombing , but the FBI and police have refused to comment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Yemen Embassy in Nairobi refused to comment on Salim , and strongly denied any connection between Yemen 's government and Osama bin Laden , the renegade Saudi millionaire whom the Clinton administration accuses of inspiring the embassy attacks</ENAMEX> .
The United States last week staged cruise missile strikes against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan it said were linked to him .
`` Yemen has no links whatsoever with any terrorist groups in general or with Osama bin Laden in particular , '' the embassy said in a statement .
Last week , the local Daily Nation reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Salim was among three jailed suspects confessed to having links to bin Laden , and to using a phony fishmongering business as cover while preparations for the attack were made .
Local reports have said witnesses identified Salim as the man who witnesses said hurled a hand grenade at embassy guards just before the blast</ENAMEX> .
A report Thursday in the East African Standard , which first reported that Salim had been flown out of the country , also said the director of a Saudi Arabian charity whose offices were raided last week by FBI agents and Kenyan police has been detained for questioning .
Mohammed Abdullah , the Sudanese director of the Mercy International Relief Agency , was taken into custody upon his arrival from Khartoum on Wednesday , the report said .
In last week 's raid of the charity 's office , FBI and police hauled away documents , computers and cash , according to an employee , and several staffers were questioned .
