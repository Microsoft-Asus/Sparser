They are in many ways a typical couple trying to carve out quality time in a 24/7 world .
He traded a promising military career for a high-ranking executive position earlier this year .
She got off the business-management track when marriage and motherhood came along , and now volunteers her services in the nonprofit sector .
Quality time takes on a whole different meaning , though , when your address is the Royal Hashemite Court in Jordan and your executive titles are , respectively , King and Queen .
It has been less than a year since King Abdullah II , 37 , became the surprise choice to succeed his father , King Hussein , after Jordan 's longtime ruler died of cancer in February at age 63 .
Abdullah 's 29-year -old wife , Queen Rania Al - Abdullah , was formally enthroned six weeks later .
Today the couple 's marriage , a blend of Arab traditionalism and Western modernism , has become something of a blueprint for the future of a country whose population is youthful -LRB- 70 percent under age 35 -RRB- but which still feels the loss of a beloved and charismatic monarch .
`` It 's something neither one of us signed up for , '' Abdullah acknowledged during a private interview recently in the couple 's sixth-floor suite at Boston 's Four Seasons Hotel .
`` Rania and I were thrown in somewhat in the deep end .
It 's been an adjustment for sure , for us and our children . ''
Seated in an armchair next to her husband , flanked by a coterie of security personnel and press aides , Queen Rania spoke to the same issue , in flawless English that reflects her college years at the American University in Cairo .
`` The fact that we took over this position at a young age means our children are also young , '' she said , conjuring up images of the Camelot - Kennedy days .
`` It 's a very sensitive and crucial time in their lives .
We both realize that they will never be 5 and 3 again .
It makes these moments very precious , and we want to appreciate them . ''
`` I think every professional couple faces the same kind of challenge , balancing work life and family life , '' she went on .
`` In our case , maybe it 's a little more exaggerated at times '' -- she giggled in unison with her husband -- `` but we do try to create that balance . ''
-- Drafted to the throne The dual interview , conducted during the royals ' recent swing through Washington and Boston , provided a rare snapshot of a young couple that has stepped smartly onto the world stage with a sense of flair as well as mission .
Until his father 's deathbed wishes were made public , Abdullah , then a tank company commander and the eldest of Hussein 's five sons , was considered a longshot to assume one of the Middle East 's key leadership posts , with his uncle , Hussein 's brother Hassan , the presumed heir to the throne .
Abdullah 's wife was no shoo-in , either , to be granted a title reserved , up until then , for her stepmother-in-law , the American -born Queen Noor , 48 , who still advocates for some worldwide causes , such as land-mine abolition .
Hussein 's decision , detailed in writing just days before he died , altered all plans .
The royal couple 's mid- October trip was originally scheduled around a high school friend 's wedding in Vermont -- a graduate of Deerfield Academy , the king has maintained close ties with several of his prep school classmates -- but it quickly stretched to accommodate meetings with business and political leaders , both here and in Washington .
The king and queen had made their first state visit to America in May .
At the White House this month , Queen Rania met privately with Hillary Clinton to discuss the first lady 's November trip to Jordan , during which issues close to the queen 's heart will be highlighted .
Prominent among these are child abuse and the economic empowerment of women throughout the Middle East , causes that Queen Rania has championed through her nonprofit Jordan River Foundation .
`` When I got interested in child abuse four or five years ago , '' her majesty commented , `` it was a subject that was n't discussed in Jordan .
There was n't even any terminology for child abuse at the time .
Now people are aware that it 's a problem that exists in every community in the world , that it needs to be brought out in the open .
We are opening the first center in the Middle East to deal with this issue , and we hope it will be a model replicated in other countries . ''
Leaning forward slightly in her chair , the queen , who is of Palestinian descent and went to school in Kuwait , noted that having two small children -LRB- Prince Hussein , 5 , and Princess Iman , 3 -RRB- drives her even harder in her efforts against child abuse in Jordan .
She credited King Hussein with raising awareness of the issue as well .
In one publicized incident before his death , he visited an orphanage where children had been mistreated , she said .
Not only were the children relocated to one of his palaces , but the king fired the minister in charge of the orphanage .
`` After that , '' said Queen Rania , `` people realized it was a very important issue in Jordan . ''
Moments later , she was asked whether she is consciously bending -- if not breaking -- cultural barriers that have faced Jordanian women in the past .
The queen spoke softly , yet emphatically .
`` I 'm not looking for revolution , '' she replied .
`` It 's a matter of taking the best from the past and looking towards the future .
My husband and His Majesty -LRB- Hussein -RRB- have both been very supportive of women having a productive role in our society . ''
