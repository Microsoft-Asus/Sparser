ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A suspect in the recent bombing of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to Kenya</ENAMEX> , the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Sunday .
A brief ministry statement said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">the suspect , identified as Mohammad Sadik Howaida , was arrested and interrogated soon after his arrival from Nairobi at the Karachi airport on Aug. 7 , the day of the nearly simultaneous bombings that killed a total of 257 people in both countries</ENAMEX> .
The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused immediate comment .
A day earlier , U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents were headed to Pakistan to question the man .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts , he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan authorities for appropriate action under their law</ENAMEX> , '' the Pakistani Foreign Ministry statement said .
It identified Howaida as an `` Arab national '' without elaboration , a phrase that in Pakistan usually means someone from anywhere in the Middle East .
The statement did not say when or how Howaida was sent to Kenya , but a government source told The Associated Press it was Friday , a week after the bombing .
The source , who insisted on anonymity , said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">investigators suspected a link between Howaida and Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> , who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for the last two years .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. officials say bin Laden , among the world 's most militant sponsors of terrorism and vocal in his hatred of the United States , was a possible suspect in the African bombings</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The source said Howaida told his interrogators that several conspirators who left Nairobi a few days before him had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , as he had planned to do .
The source said that though U.S. investigators traveled to Karachi , Pakistani officials questioned the man and decided to turn him over to Kenya instead of the United States .
It was not clear if the United States had requested custody of Howaida and been refused .
When Mir Aimal Kasi , a Pakistani later convicted in the United States of killing two CIA employees , was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint FBI - Pakistani operation , angry Pakistanis accused their government of groveling before U.S. power .
The government source said the suspect was detained at the Karachi airport because immigration officials noticed he did not match the photograph in the passport he was carrying .
When he tried to bribe the officials , he was arrested , the newspaper said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Pakistani newspapers identified the suspect by a slightly different name , Mohammed Sadique</ENAMEX> .
The national newspaper The News , quoting unidentified government sources Sunday , said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">the suspect confessed to planning the bombings .</ENAMEX>
The News said he received help in Kenya from sympathizers with connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization .
Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad , or Islamic Holy War .
Before the bombings , a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were arrested in Albania .
The group is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 .
