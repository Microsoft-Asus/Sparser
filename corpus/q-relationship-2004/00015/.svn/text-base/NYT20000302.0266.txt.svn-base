GHANIKHEL , Afghanistan --
The merchants at the big opium bazaar here are crying the blues , what with sales so low and prices down by half .
Abdul Wahab picked up a few chunks of his unrefined goods , which look like dried-up cow pies .
He put the opium on his scale and measured the weight with lead balances .
A year ago he was getting $ 140 per kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- ; now he gets $ 62 .
`` We ca n't make a profit at these prices , '' he complained , just before closing his shop for noontime prayers .
`` What am I supposed to do for money ?
Rob people ? ''
The problem is the ruling Taliban militia , who finally seem to be putting limits on the drug trade .
They have much to accomplish .
In 1999 Afghanistan 's crop of raw opium amounted to a record 5,070 tons -- about 75 percent of the global yield .
In Ghanikhel , where opium is sold as openly as onions , the traders grumble about a crackdown on their best customers , the nearby laboratories that make the drug into morphine and heroin .
`` With the labs dismantled , there are no buyers , '' Wahab said .
While that is an overstatement , business in this dusty , decrepit bazaar of two dozen shops and one main street has certainly slumped .
Store roofs are made of straw and look ready to cave in .
Donkeys prowl about .
One long-dead dog was lying near a vegetable seller 's pushcart .
Flies fluttered in crazed loops above its carcass .
However modest in looks , this bazaar has long been a commercial hub for the surrounding provinces , where beautiful pink and white poppies flourish .
Ghanikhel is about 20 miles from the city of Jalalabad , just a few hours ' drive from the Khyber Pass .
Decades back , this opium market was built at a discreet distance from any paved road -- a precaution largely unneeded during most of Afghanistan 's freewheeling history .
Wahab , 45 , wears a large blue turban made more vivid by his long white beard .
He is what some might call a wholesaler .
Farmers sell him the gummy opium they milk from the swollen poppy pods .
He in turn sells the dried-out drug to people with the means to refine it .
While Wahab is considered prosperous in Ghanikhel , the biggest money in the opium trade is made by distributors far closer to the retail end .
Wahab 's shop , like most others , is a room barely 10 feet square .
He keeps the sample cakes of opium in a small heap near a tea kettle .
His money is stashed in an ammunition box .
There are no lights .
The floor is covered with a threadbare rug , the walls with bright cloths .
On a recent Sunday he was bored .
He said he had not sold a thing all day .
A friend , Syed Nabi , strolled by .
He makes money as a broker , steering farmers to the merchants .
`` The Taliban have been checking the trafficking routes , '' he said indignantly .
`` With opium you 're OK .
But with heroin , a few people have been arrested . ''
This is a nasty turn for those whose livelihoods depend on poppies .
Afghanistan has endured 21 straight years of war .
Irrigation canals have been destroyed , and the soil has been booby-trapped with land mines .
Farmers do n't have much going for them .
`` We do understand that the Taliban have a dilemma , '' said Bernard Frahi , head of the U.N. Drug Control Program in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
`` They ca n't institute a full-fledged eradication program .
They tell us that 'd lead to a revolt . ''
Indeed , the Taliban have done nothing so drastic as to outlaw drugs , despite condemning them as anathema to the sacred teachings of Islam .
But they have sporadically shut down processing labs and made a show of burning heroin in bonfires .
Their most important action against drugs came in September .
After insistent pleading from the United Nations , the Taliban 's supreme leader , Mullah Muhammad Omar , ordered farmers to cut poppy cultivation by a third .
The spring harvest will tell the tale , but early reports indicate that at least in some regions the militia have enforced the decree .
Mullah Omar , a pious Muslim with one eye and three wives , has issued similar commands before , but these went by the wayside .
The man is under conflicting pressures .
The Taliban began conquering territory in 1994 , but 10 percent to 20 percent of the country remains outside their control .
A crusade against drugs would be unpopular .
Poppies fill many pockets , especially those of local warlords with more than a passing interest in the trade .
At the same time , the Taliban themselves have enjoyed revenues from the opium business , taxing the lucrative poppy harvest the same way they do other crops and collecting a second assessment as the drugs are transported .
Each year , the levies amount to $ 10 million to $ 30 million .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The United Nations does not recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government , but on the poppy issue the Taliban 's supreme leader seems to be issuing a challenge : put up or shut up .</ENAMEX>
After reducing poppy cultivation , `` we will look to the reaction of the world community , '' read Mullah Omar 's September decree .
If other nations provide `` economic assistance in lieu of this opium , '' the campaign against the poppy will continue .
As Frahi of the United Nations cautiously said : `` We live in a difficult reality .
If we 're to succeed , we have to address the problem of poverty in Afghanistan in a systematic way .
For that , we need funding and donor support , and most of the world wants nothing to do with the Taliban . ''
The ins and outs of global politics are lost on the average poppy farmer .
Near Ghanikhel , green sprouts have busted through the ground and reach toward the sun .
People are desperately poor .
Earnings from poppies are threefold those from wheat .
Some farmers have no choice but to plant poppies .
They live in debt and need to borrow to make it from year to year .
Lenders demand that they plant the more profitable crop .
`` Yes , I know what I grow is poison to other people , '' said a sharecropper who uses the single name Khalil .
He pointed into the distance .
`` I ca n't get a loan unless I do what those men tell me , the ones who live in the good houses with the big gates . ''
Such contrition is uncommon , however .
After all , this is Ghanikhel .
Poppy -growing has been part of the culture for generations .
`` This is what my ancestors planted , '' said Khyber Gul , 28 , standing in a pasture with his little son .
`` This boy will plant it , too . ''
Gul has not obeyed Mullah Omar 's decree -- and he had some advice for the Taliban : `` If they want to destroy my poppies , they can .
But if this is what they do to people , I promise one thing .
They wo n't be around forever . ''
