PRAGUE , Czech Republic
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
After terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa , the new Czech government is having second thoughts about allowing a U.S. -run radio station here to beam special programs to Iran and Iraq .
The United States had reached an agreement with the previous , center-right government of Prime Minister Josef Tosovsky for the Prague -based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast a new Farsi language service to Iran and an Arabic language `` Radio Free Iraq '' by the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 .
This month , however , a new center-left government under Prime Minister Milos Zeman came to power .
Government spokesman Libor Roucek said the Cabinet will meet Wednesday to consider `` various aspects '' of the programs .
`` Nobody has spoken to us about it yet , '' Roucek said of the Iran and Iraq broadcasts .
`` Before deciding on the fate of the project , we must first get accurate information on all aspects of the broadcast . ''
Jan Oberman , director of RFE/RL in Prague , refused comment on the government 's concerns but added , `` I can tell you we are negotiating with the Czech government '' Foreign Minister Jan Kavan told the newspaper Pravo that that the new Czech government has not received any formal request from Washington to approve the broadcasts .
He indicated that the Czech government has reservations about the plan .
`` As far as I know , the government of Prime Minister Tosovsky agreed with RFE on these broadcasts , but on condition that the first four months would be closely monitored to see how balanced and objective they are , '' Kavan said .
Last week , Deputy Prime Minister Egon Lansky , one of the more left-leaning members of the new government , said that such broadcasts were a `` sensitive matter '' and that `` RFE ca n't do here what they want . ''
A spokesman for RFE/RL , Alena Fendrychova , declined comment on the issue , saying `` we have an -LRB- information -RRB- embargo on the case . ''
Such broadcasts are popular with congressional conservatives , who have seen them as a means of combating policies of Tehran and Baghdad which they feel threatened American foreign policy interests .
The Clinton administration , which has been frustrated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 's defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors and authoritarian rule , heartily backed the congressionally mandated `` Radio Free Iraq '' program .
But the White House balked at lawmakers ' approval for starting a `` Radio Free Iran , '' fearing it could undermine efforts to rebuild ties with Iran now that a relative moderate , Mohammad Khatami , is president .
As a result , the Iran broadcasts are being referred to simply as a new Farsi language service of RFE/RL , which began transmitting behind the Iron Curtain and in the former Soviet Union during the Cold War .
The station moved from Munich , Germany , to Prague in 1995 after the fall of Communism .
Czech concerns have increased since the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , which killed 257 people and injured more than 5,000 .
The United States blamed the attacks on an international terrorist network under Osama bin Laden , and launched cruise missile strikes on training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in retaliation .
During the Cold War , RFE/RL was popular among Czechs and others in the Soviet Bloc as an alternative to the Communist propaganda of their own media .
Now , however , many ordinary Czechs are nervous that their country may end up drawn into the conflict if the Iranian and Iraqi programs go on the air .
Last week , the Czech newspaper Slovo reported that an unidentified man who owns a house near RFE/RL 's new office in the city 's sixth district moved after learning of plans to broadcast programs from the new location .
The man , who was not identified at his request , demanded that RFE buy the house but later offered to rent it to RFE/RL employees .
The newspaper also quoted an employee at a kindergarten near the station as saying it was `` irresponsible '' for the station to put children at risk .
