BRUSSELS , October 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The European Commission -LRB- EC -RRB- and South Korea are to hold top-level talks this week in a last-ditch bid to solve a dispute over access to the lucrative South Korean telecommunications market .
EC Vice President and Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is to take up the issue during a meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro Myung on October 28 in Luxembourg .
The EC claims that South Korea discriminates against foreign companies in its 8 billion- U.S. -dollar-a-year telecommunications procurement market through legislation and practice .
The main national operator , Korea Telecom , is told to buy from the country 's manufacturers whenever possible and the second operator , Dacom , has a similar purchasing policy , the EC claims .
These policies , which are contrary to the national treatment rule of the World Trade Organization , cost European exporters some 900 million dollars a year , the EC says .
The Commission has been trying to get South Korea to open up its market for the last two years , but negotiations so far have failed to come up with an agreement .
If these latest talks fail the EC is threatening to take the dispute to the World Trade Organization for arbitration .
