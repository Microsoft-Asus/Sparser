AUSTIN , Texas --
A suspected member of a deadly prison gang who is accused of killing a rival gang member last week painstakingly sawed his way out of his cell with dental floss or similar plastic-coated string , a high-ranking official said .
`` What we 've been able to determine is that he was using some nylon string -- something like dental floss -- and was putting an abrasive on it like toothpaste and was able to saw through the bar that way , '' said Alfred M. `` Mac '' Stringfellow , chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice .
Inmate Antonio Lara , 26 , a suspected member of the prison gang Hermanos de Pistoleros Latinos -LRB- HPL -RRB- , is accused in the stabbing death last week of Roland Rios , 41 , a confirmed member of the Texas Syndicate gang , at the Coffield Unit .
The killing sparked a systemwide lockdown that prison administrators hoped would prevent gang warfare from erupting .
Stringfellow said Lara , who is serving a 15-year sentence for attempted murder , robbery and aggravated assault out of Webb County , crawled out from under his cell bars to get at Rios as he was being escorted by guards to the shower .
Rios was serving a 10-year term for aggravated robbery and injury to a child from Nueces County .
Stringfellow said he did not know how many bars Lara cut through to get out of his cell .
At 5-foot-11 and 269 pounds , however , he likely would have had to cut through several bars .
Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen Castlebury declined to discuss the details of how Lara got out or whether the prisoner returned to his cell after the attack .
`` He was very dedicated at doing this , '' Stringfellow said of Lara 's persistence in cutting the cell bars .
`` These are items they get very readily at the commissary .
They are very resourceful people .
That 's all they have is time , so they can sit there and saw away until they finally are able to cut through it . ''
Stringfellow , however , said prison administrators still are not certain whether the killing was a gang-ordered hit or personal spat between Lara and Rios .
`` What we were concerned about was that the Texas Syndicate members may want to do some retaliation against the HPL , so that was the reason '' for the lockdown , Stringfellow added .
Former Texas Department of Criminal Justice warden Terry Pelz , who now is a nationally recognized prison-gang expert , said that if Lara did cut his way out of his cell , `` then this was a well-planned attack . ''
`` The HPL are determined to make a name for themselves , '' he said .
`` While the war has gone on for a couple of months , the attack on Rios was an opportunity that presented itself .
It may well have been something personal between the two and it was a pre-emptive strike .
Anyway , it 's too late .
A lockdown wo n't be a cooling-off period .
The TS is run from California .
Orders to pursue the HPL all out will come from there . ''
He said that problems between the TS and HPL have been escalating over the past two months .
Likewise , another former prison official with prison gang expertise said that TDCJ gang-intelligence officers had issued an alert earlier this year that trouble was brewing between these two particular gangs .
`` Things have been bubbling for a while , '' said the expert who asked not to be identified .
`` There 's a lot of tension right now ... The TS will respond , even if it takes six years .
But they will respond and in greater fashion . ''
-LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Meanwhile on Monday , wardens at units across the state began gradually allowing some inmates out of their cells , Castlebury said .
He said he did not know how many prisoners remained in lockdown status nor how many weapons or other contraband was found .
Some portions of most units have been released , Castlebury said , but there are no units totally freed from lockdown status .
He added it will likely be midweek before any units lift sanctions for all prisoners .
He characterized the contraband confiscated during the lockdown as typical of what TDCJ finds whenever it shakes down prisons .
`` There is n't going to be something like a 9 mm Glock that 's found , '' he added .
`` It 's just routine and heavily nuisance contraband -- overage of necessity , like someone has entirely too many more pairs of undies than he 's supposed to have .
`` A lot of these people are just pack rats , and it 's time for housecleaning . ''
