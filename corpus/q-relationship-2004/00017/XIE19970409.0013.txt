HANOI , April 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- United States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin left Ho Chi Minh City today , ending his three-day visit to Vietnam .
It was the first visit by a U.S. treasury secretary to Vietnam since the Vietnam war ended in 1975 .
Rubin held talks with his Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi Monday , and signed an accord after the talks to reschedule a debt of 145 million U.S. dollars accumulated by the former Saigon regime during the war .
Under the accord , Vietnam will pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars within 30 days while the rest of the debt will be rescheduled by stages within the next 22 years .
Rubin described the signing as `` an important step towards normalization between the two countries , and the entry by Vietnam into the international financial community . ''
Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister for American Affairs Nguyen Dinh Bin said the signing was a positive indication of the two countries ' determination to `` end the past and open the future . ''
During his visit , Rubin met separately with Secretary General of the Vietnamese Communist Party Do Muoi today , and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet Monday .
The Vietnamese leaders told Rubin there were positive signs since normalization between the two countries , especially in the economic fields .
But they argued that relations between the two countries had not been fully normalized , and Vietnam was not responsible for the slow progress the two had made in normalizing their economic relationship .
Vietnam looked to enhance the economic and trade cooperation with the United States , they stressed .
The bilateral trade volume hit 935 million U.S. dollars in 1996 , double that of the previous year .
The United States has invested 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in Vietnam , and was its eighth biggest foreign investor .
