-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A prominent defector from North Korea has received 250 million won -LRB- dlrs 185,200 -RRB- in a cash reward from the South Korean government , officials said Tuesday .
Hwang Jang Yop , 75 , a former communist party secretary and confidant to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , arrived in Seoul in April 1997 , becoming the highest-ranking North Korean official to defect to rival South Korea .
Hwang 's cash award was 36 times the dlrs 5,100 given to an ordinary defector .
`` We are providing defectors with financial assistance according to the quantity and quality of the data they bring with them , '' Unification Minister Kang In -duk told a parliamentary hearing Tuesday .
Hwang first defected to the South Korean Embassy in Beijing last year , creating an international diplomatic furor involving the two Koreas and China .
After 67 days and a side trip to the Philippines , he was allowed to reach Seoul .
Hwang was said to have brought South Korean authorities valuable information , including a rare insight into the thinking of the reclusive North 's leadership .
South Korea welcomes defectors from communist North Korea , viewing them as living testimony to the superiority of its capitalist system .
As food and fuel shortages have worsened in North Korea , more than 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years , mostly through China .
But the upsurge in defectors has created budget problems for the Seoul government , which has cut cash rewards to around dlrs 5,100 , down from the previous dlrs 10,000 .
Korea has been divided into the communist North and capitalist South since 1945 .
The two sides fought a bloody war in 1950-53 .
