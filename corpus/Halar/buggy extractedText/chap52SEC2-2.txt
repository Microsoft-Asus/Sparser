 Demography is the study of factors that affect the growth and decline of populations

Changes in population size reflect the relative rates of processes that add individuals to the population and eliminate individuals from it. Additions occur through births (which we will define here to include all forms of reproduction) and immigration, the influx of new individuals from other areas. Opposing these additions are mortality (death) and emigration, the movement of individuals out of a population. Our focus in this chapter is primarily on factors that influence birth rates and death rates, but you should remember that immigration and emigration may also play a role in population dynamics.

The study of the vital statistics that affect population size is called demography. Birth rates vary among individuals (specifically, among females) within a population, depending, in particular, on age; and death rates depend on both age and sex. Let's see how these demographic variables affect population dynamics.

Life Tables and Survivorship Curves

About a century ago, when life insurance first became available, insurance companies developed an interest in the mathematics of survival. They needed to estimate how long, on average, an individual of a given age could be expected to live. Some of the greatest demographers of the past century worked for life insurance companies. They invented demographic representations called life tables. A life table is an age-specific summary of the survival pattern of a population. Population ecologists adapted this approach for nonhuman populations and developed quantitative demography as a branch of biology.

The best way to construct a life table is to follow the fate of a cohort, a group of individuals of the same age, from birth until all are dead. The table is constructed from the number of individuals that die in each age-group during the defined time period. Cohort life tables are difficult to collect on wild animals and plants and are available only for a limited number of species.

TABLE 52.1 is a life table for a cohort of Belding ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) at Tioga Pass, in California. Much can be learned about a population from a life table. The third column in the table shows the proportion of individuals in a cohort that are still alive at a given age. Notice that the death rates are generally highest among the youngest ground squirrels and among the oldest individuals and that males suffer higher rates of loss than females.

W. Sherman and M. L. Morton, "Demography of Belding's Ground Squirrel,"Ecology 65(1984): 1617-1628.A graphic way of representing the data in a life table is to draw a survivorship curve, a plot of the proportion or numbers in a cohort still alive at each age (FIGURE 52.3). Survivorship curves can be classified into three general types. A Type I curve is relatively flat at the start, reflecting low death rates during early and middle life, then drops steeply as death rates increase among older age-groups. Humans and many other large mammals that produce relatively few offspring but provide them with good care often exhibit this kind of curve. In contrast, a Type III curve drops sharply at the left of the graph, reflecting very high death rates for the young, but then flattens out as death rates decline for those few individuals that have survived to a certain critical age. This type of curve is usually associated with organisms that produce very large numbers of offspring but provide little or no care, such as many fishes and marine invertebrates. An oyster, for example, may release millions of eggs, but most offspring die as larvae from predation or other causes. Those few that manage to survive long enough to attach to a suitable substrate and begin growing a hard shell, however, will probably survive for a relatively long time. Type II curves are intermediate, with a constant death rate over the life span. This kind of survivorship occurs in some annual plants, various invertebrates such as Hydra, some lizard species, and some rodents, such as the gray squirrel.

Fig 52-3. Idealized survivorship curves. As an example of a Type I curve, humans in developed countries experience high survival rates until old age. At the opposite extreme are Type III curves for organisms such as oysters, which experience very high mortality as larvae but decreased mortality later in life. Type II survivorship curves are intermediate between the other two types and result when a constant proportion of individuals die at each age. Notice that the y axis is logarithmic and that the x axis is on a relative scale, so that species with widely varying life spans can be compared on the same graph.

Many species, of course, fall somewhere between these basic types of survivorship or show more complex patterns. In birds, for example, mortality is often high among the youngest individuals (as in a Type III curve) but fairly constant among adults (as in a Type II curve). Some invertebrates, such as crabs, may show a "stair-stepped" curve, with brief periods of increased mortality during molts (caused by physiological problems or greater vulnerability to predation), followed by periods of lower mortality (when the exoskeleton is hard).

In populations without immigration or emigration, survivorship is one of the two key factors determining changes in population size. Next we consider reproductive output, the other key factor determining population trends.

Reproductive Rates

Demographers who study sexually reproducing species generally ignore males and concentrate on females in the population because only females give birth to offspring. Demographers view populations in terms of females giving rise to new females; males are important only as distributors of genes. How can we describe the reproductive program of a population? The simplest way is to follow the basic approach of the life table and ask how reproductive output varies with age.

A reproductive table, or fertility schedule, is an age- specific summary of the reproductive rates in a population. The best way to construct a fertility schedule is to measure the reproductive output of a cohort from birth until death. For sexual species, the reproductive table tallies the number of female offspring produced by each age-group. TABLE 52.2 illustrates a reproductive table for Belding ground squirrels. Reproductive output for sexual species like birds and mammals is a product of the fraction of females of a given age that are breeding and the number of female offspring of those breeding females. By multiplying these together, we can obtain the average output of daughters for each individual in a given age class (the last column in TABLE 52.1). For these ground squirrels, which begin to reproduce at age 1 year, reproductive output rises to a peak at 4 years of age and then falls off in older females.

W. Sherman and M. L. Morton, "Demography of Belding's Ground Squirrel,"Ecology 65(1984): 1617-1628.Reproductive tables vary greatly, depending on the species. Squirrels have a litter of two to six young once a year, whereas oak trees drop thousands of acorns each year for tens or hundreds of years. Salmon lay thousands of eggs when they spawn, and mussels and other invertebrates may release hundreds of thousands of eggs in a spawning cycle. Why does one type of life cycle rather than another evolve in a particular population? This is one of the many questions at the interface of population ecology and evolutionary biology.
