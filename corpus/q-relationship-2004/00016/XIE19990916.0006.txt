AMMAN , September 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday that Moscow is ready to keep in touch with all parties concerned to push forward the Middle East peace process .
In a message to Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein , Yeltsin said Russia would contact all parties concerned to help rebuild confidence in the peace talks between Israel , the Palestinians , Syria and Lebanon to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region .
Yeltsin also expressed his appreciation for Abdullah 's `` constructive role and efforts exerted to push forward the peace process , '' Jordan 's official news agency Petra reported .
The message is apparently reminding the parties concerned of the fact that Russia does not want to be sidelined in the peace process after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power in July .
The former Soviet Union had been a key player in the Middle East affairs with strategic relations with Israel 's Arab neighbors Egypt , Syria , Lebanon and the Palestinians during its Cold War with the United States , which supported the Jewish state .
Moscow 's influence in the Middle East has been steadily declining due to its own chronic economic and political problems at home following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
However , Russia currently remains one of the biggest arms suppliers to Syria and the two countries are still keeping their traditionally strong relationships .
Jordan has been playing a pivotal role in the peace process and supports the resumption of peace talks on all tracks , including the peace talks between Israel , the Palestinians , Syria and Lebanon .
