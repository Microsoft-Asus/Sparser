PLANT DEFENSE: RESPONSES TO HERBIVORES AND PATHOGENS

 

 Plants deter herbivores with both physical and chemical defenses



 

 Plants use multiple lines of defense against pathogens



Plants do not exist in isolation, but interact with many other species in their communities. Some of these interspecific interactions--for example, the associations of plants with fungi in mycorrhizae (see Chapter 37) or with insect pollinators (see Chapter 38)--are mutually beneficial. Most of the interactions that plants have with other organisms, however, are not beneficial to the plant. As primary producers, plants are at the base of most food webs and are subject to attack by a wide range of plant-eating (herbivorous) animals. A plant is also subject to infection by a diversity of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi that have the potential to damage tissues or even kill the plant. Plants counter these threats with defense systems that deter herbivory and prevent infection or combat pathogens that do manage to infect the plant.
