CANBERRA , September 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- International negotiations on southern bluefin tuna quotas stalled today after Australia , Japan and New Zealand failed to reach an agreement , Australian Resources Minister Warwick Parer said today .
The three countries , which form the Commission of the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna , were unable to agree on the total allowable catch and national quota allocations , the minister said in a statement .
`` Australia is very concerned that the tuna stock is still severely depleted and that there is not , as yet , clear evidence that the stock is rebuilding , '' the minister said .
Two species of tuna occur off the east coast of Australia , with the southern species an important commercial fish .
The minister said that the commission hoped to meet again in October and that the next move would be to address the rapid increase in catch by countries operating outside the commission , such as Korea and Indonesia .
The commission agreed both countries should join as a matter of urgency , he said .
