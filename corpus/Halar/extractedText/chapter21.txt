This chapter applies much of what you've learned about molecules, cells, and genes to one of biology's most important questions--how a complex multicellular organism develops from a single cell. The application of genetic analysis and DNA technology to the study of development has brought about a revolution in the field. In much the same way that researchers have used mutations to deduce pathways of cellular metabolism, they now use mutations to dissect developmental pathways. In one striking example, Swiss researchers demonstrated in 1995 that a particular gene functions as a master switch that triggers the development of the eye inDrosophila.The scanning electron micrograph on this page shows the head of an abnormal fly with small extra eyes on its antennae. Expression of the master gene for eye development in an abnormal location in the fly caused the extra eyes. A similar gene triggers eye development in mice and other mammals. In fact, developmental biologists are discovering remarkable similarities in the mechanisms that shape diverse organisms.

The scientific study of development got under way about a century ago, around the same time as genetics. But for decades the two disciplines proceeded along mostly separate paths. We have seen how geneticists advanced from Mendel's laws to an understanding of the molecular basis of inheritance. Meanwhile, developmental biologists focused on embryology, the study of the stages of development leading from fertilized egg to fully formed organism. Only in recent years have the concepts and tools of molecular genetics reached the point where a real synthesis has been possible. The synthesis is a challenge, for it means relating the linear information in genes to a process of development that takes place in four dimensions, three of space and one of time.

This chapter introduces some of the basic genetic and cellular mechanisms that control development. It focuses on principles that apply to both animals and plants, with emphasis on two invertebrate animals: the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterand the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.In later chapters, you will learn much more about the development of plants (Chapter 35) and animals (Chapter 47).

A capstone to the genetics unit, this chapter also serves as a bridge to the rest of the book, for understanding development is crucial to understanding the evolution, diversity, structure, function, and ecology of organisms.





FROM SINGLE CELL TO MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM

 

 Embryonic development involves cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis



 

 Researchers study development in model organisms to identify general principles



In the development of most multicellular organisms, a single-celled zygote (fertilized egg) gives rise to cells of many different types, each type with a different structure and corresponding function. For example, an animal will have muscle cells that enable it to move and nerve cells that transmit signals to the muscle cells; a plant will have mesophyll cells that carry out photosynthesis and stomatal cells that regulate the passage of gases into and out of leaves (seeFIGURE 10.2). As you know, cells are only one level in the hierarchy of biological order within a multicellular organism (seeFIGURE 2.1). Cells of similar types are organized into tissues, tissues into organs, organs into organ systems, and organ systems into the whole organism. Thus, the process of embryonic development must give rise not only to cells of different types but to higher-level structures arranged in a particular way in three dimensions.





DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION

 

 Different types of cells in an organism have the same DNA



 

 Different cell types make different proteins, usually as a result of transcriptional regulation



 

 Transcriptional regulation is directed by maternal molecules in the cytoplasm and signals from other cells



We have stated on several previous occasions that differences between cells in a multicellular organism come almost entirely from differences in geneexpression, not from differences in the cells' genomes. (There are a few exceptions, such as antibody-producing cells; seeFIGURE 19.6) Furthermore, we have mentioned that these differences arise during development, as regulatory mechanisms turn specific genes on and off. Let's now look at some of the evidence for this assertion.

 Plant development depends on cell signaling and transcriptional regulation



How do cytoplasmic determinants, inductive signals, and their effects on embryonic cells contribute to morphogenesis, the shaping of the organism and its parts? We'll explore this question in the context ofpattern formation,the development of aspatial organizationin which the tissues and organs of an organism are all in their characteristic places. In the life of a plant, pattern formation occurs continually, in the apical meristems (seeFIGURE 21.2b). In animals, pattern formation is mostly limited to embryos and juveniles.

Pattern formation in animals begins in the early embryo, when the animal's basic body plan--its overall three-dimensional arrangement--is established. Just as the outline of a building is laid out before construction begins, the major axes of an animal are established very early. Before specialized tissues or organs appear, the relative positions of the animal's head and tail, for example, are established. The molecular cues that control pattern formation, collectively calledpositional information,tell a cell its location relative to the body axes and to neighboring cells and determine how the cell and its progeny will respond to future molecular signals.





 Embryonic development involves cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis

An organism arises from a fertilized egg cell as the result of three interrelated processes: cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis (FIGURE 21.1). Through a succession of mitotic divisions, the zygote gives rise to a large number of cells. Cell division alone, however, would produce only a great ball of identical cells, nothing like an animal or plant. During embryonic development, cells not only increase in number, but also undergodifferentiation,becoming specialized in structure and function. Moreover, the different kinds of cells aren't just mixed up randomly but are organized into tissues and organs. The physical processes that give an organism its shape constitutemorphogenesis,meaning "creation of form."

The processes of cell division, differentiation, and morphogenesis overlap in time. Early events of morphogenesis lay out the basic body plan very early in embryonic development, establishing, for example, which end of an animal embryo will be the head or which end of a plant embryo will become the roots. Cell division and differentiation play important roles in morphogenesis in all organisms, as does the programmed death of certain cells. However, the overall schemes of morphogenesis in animals and plants are very different, and the mechanisms differ in two major ways (FIGURE 21.2, p. 404). First, in animals, but not in plants,movementsof cells and tissues are necessary to transform the early embryo into the characteristic three-dimensional form of the organism. We will discuss these morphogenetic movements in Chapter 47. The second major difference is that in plants, morphogenesis and growth in overall size are not limited to embryonic and juvenile periods but occur throughout the life of the plant.Apical meristems,which are perpetually embryonic regions in the tips of shoots and roots, are responsible for the plant's continual growth and formation of new organs, such as leaves and roots. In animals, ongoing development in adults is restricted to the differentiation of cells, such as blood cells, that must be continually replenished throughout the animal's lifetime.

Fig 21-2. Some key stages of development in animals and plants.Cell division, morphogenesis, and cell differentiation occur in both animal development and plant development.(a)Most animals go through some variation of the blastula and gastrula stages shown here in simplified form. The blastula is a sphere of cells surrounding a fluid-filled cavity. In forming the gastrula, a region of the blastula folds inward, forming a rudimentary gut cavity. The movement of cells and tissues plays an important role in animal morphogenesis. Biochemical events that will lead to cellular differentiation actually start before the gastrula forms. Once the animal is mature, differentiation occurs in only a limited way--for the replacement of damaged or lost cells.(b)In plants with seeds, a complete embryo develops within the seed. Morphogenesis, which does not involve cell or tissue movement, occurs throughout the plant's lifetime. Apical meristems (yellow) continuously arise and develop into the various plant organs as the plant grows to an indeterminate size.

The importance of precise regulation of morphogenesis is evident in human disorders that result from morphogenesis gone awry. For example, cleft palate, in which the upper wall of the mouth cavity fails to close completely, is a defect of morphogenesis.

As humans, we may naturally be most interested in developmental processes in our own species. However, many aspects of development are much easier to study in other kinds of organisms.





 Researchers study development in model organisms to identify general principles

Much of the early research on animal development focused on animals that lay their eggs in water, with amphibians, such as frogs, getting particular attention. Frogs have large eggs (2-3 mm in diameter) that are easy to observe and manipulate, and fertilization and development occur outside the mother's body. By studying these animals and others, biologists were able to work out a description of animal development at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, making a number of important discoveries in the process (see Chapter 47). Research on a variety of plants led to a basic understanding of plant development (see Chapter 35). When the primary research goal is to understand broad biological principles--of animal or plant development in this case--the organism chosen for study is called amodel organism.Researchers select model organisms that lend themselves to the study of a particular question and that are representative of a larger group. Frogs, for example, are useful model organisms for elucidating the role of cell movement in morphogenesis because frog development is easy to observe and fairly typical of vertebrate animals.

However, for the more recent research efforts aimed at uncovering the connections between genes and development, many developmental biologists have turned to organisms that are more convenient for genetic analysis. For developmental genetics, the criteria for choosing a model organism include, in addition to readily observable embryos, short generation times, relatively small genomes, and, ideally, preexisting knowledge about the organism and its genes. Several organisms have emerged as favorites, includingDrosophila, the nematodeC. elegans, the mouse, the zebrafish, and the plantArabidopsis(FIGURE 21.3).

Fig 21-3. Model organisms.Each of these organisms offers particular advantages for research on the genetics of development.

First chosen as a model organism by the pioneering geneticist T. H. Morgan and intensively studied by generations of geneticists after him, the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasteris small and easily grown in the laboratory. As you read in Chapter 15,Drosophilahas a generation time of only two weeks and produces many offspring. Embryos develop outside the mother's body, an asset for developmental studies. And researchers can draw on a vast amount of information and experience relating to this animal's genes and other aspects of its biology. (The DNA sequence of its genome was completed in 2000.) One disadvantage of the fruit fly as a model organism for developmental research is that its early development is at least superficially quite different from the process depicted inFIGURE 21.2: The first rounds of mitosis occur without cytokinesis, leading to an early blastula containing a large number of nuclei within a single mass of cytoplasm. Nevertheless, research onDrosophiladevelopment has yielded deep insights into basic principles of animal development, as we will see.

The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansnormally lives in soil but is easily grown in the laboratory in petri dishes. It is only about a millimeter long, has a simple, transparent body with only a few types of cells, and grows from zygote to mature adult in only three and a half days. One of its advantages for genetic studies is that its genome has been sequenced. Another is that most individuals are hermaphrodites, which produce both eggs and sperm. Hermaphrodites are convenient for genetic studies because recessive mutations are easy to detect. As with any diploid organism, an individual with a recessive mutation in only one copy of a gene will have the wild-type phenotype. But a researcher can quickly detect the mutation by allowing the worm to self-fertilize: One-fourth of the offspring will be homozygous for the mutant allele and have a mutant phenotype.

For developmental biologists, a further important feature ofC. elegansis that every adult hermaphrodite has exactly 959 somatic cells (some of which are fused together), and these cells arise from the zygote in virtually the same way for every individual. Using a microscope to follow all the cell divisions starting immediately after a zygote forms, biologists have been able to reconstruct the entire ancestry of every cell in the adult body, the organism's completecell lineage.A cell lineage diagram like the one inFIGURE 21.4(p. 406) is a type offate map, a representation of the fates of various parts of a developing embryo. (You'll see more fate maps in Chapter 47.)

Fig 21-4. Cell lineage inC. elegans.The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis transparent at all stages of its development, making it possible for researchers to trace the lineage of every cell, from the zygote to the adult worm (LM). The diagram shows a detailed lineage only for the intestine, which is derived exclusively from one of the first four cells formed from the zygote. The intestinal cell lineage does not happen to include any programmed cell death, an important aspect of the lineages for some other parts of the animal.

Among vertebrates, two in particular lend themselves to the genetic analysis of development, the mouse and the zebrafish. The mouseMus musculushas a long history as a mammalian model, and much is known about its biology, including its genes. Moreover, researchers are now adept at manipulating mouse genes to make transgenic mice and mice in which particular genes are "knocked out" by mutation. But mice are complex animals with a genome as large as ours, and their embryos develop in the mother's uterus, hidden from view.

Many of the disadvantages of the mouse are absent in a newer vertebrate model, the zebrafishDanio rerio. These small fish (2-4 cm long) are easy to breed in the laboratory in large numbers, and transparent embryos develop outside the mother's body. Although the generation time is relatively long (two to four months), the early stages of development proceed quickly: By 24 hours after fertilization, most of the tissues and early versions of the organs have formed, and by two days a tiny fish hatches out of the egg case. Although the zebrafish genome is still being mapped and sequenced, researchers such as Nancy Hopkins (see the interview at the opening of this unit) have already identified many genes involved in the animal's development.

For studying the molecular genetics of plant development, researchers are focusing on a small weed calledArabidopsis thaliana(the common wall cress, a member of the mustard family). One of these plants can grow in a test tube and produce thousands of progeny after eight to ten weeks; as in Mendel's pea plants, each flower makes both ova and sperm (in pollen). For gene manipulation research, scientists can growArabidopsiscells in culture and get the cells to take up foreign DNA (genetic transformation). Another advantage ofArabidopsisis that it has a relatively small genome, about 100 million nucleotide pairs, which has already been sequenced.

Later in this chapter, you will learn about important discoveries that researchers have made using some of these model organisms.





 Different types of cells in an organism have the same DNA

Much evidence supports the conclusion that nearly all the cells of an organism havegenomic equivalence--that is, they all have the same genes. What happens to these genes as a cell begins to differentiate? We can shed some light on this question by asking whether genes are irreversibly inactivated during differentiation. For example, does an epidermal cell in your finger contain a viable gene specifying eye color, or has the eye-color gene been destroyed or permanently inactivated there?

Totipotency in Plants

One experimental approach to the question of genomic equivalence is to try to generate a whole organism from differentiated cells of a single type. In many plant species, whole new individualscandevelop from differentiated somatic cells. This was first demonstrated during the 1950s by F. C. Steward and his students at Cornell University, working with carrot plants (FIGURE 21.5). They found that differentiated cells removed from the root (the carrot) and placed in culture medium could grow into normal adult plants, each genetically identical to the "parent" plant. Using a single somatic cell from a multicellular organism to make one or more genetically identical individuals is calledcloning,and each new individual is popularly called aclone.(The meanings of these terms vary with context; for clarification, see the Glossary.) The fact that a mature plant cell can dedifferentiate (reverse its differentiation) and then give rise to all the different kinds of specialized cells of a new plant shows that differentiation does not necessarily involve irreversible changes in the DNA. In plants, at least, cells can remaintotipotent;that is, they can retain the zygote's potential to form all parts of the mature organism. Plant cloning is now used extensively in agriculture.

Nuclear Transplantation in Animals

Differentiated cells from animals will often fail to divide in culture, much less develop into a new organism. Therefore, animal researchers have approached the genomic equivalence question by replacing the nucleus of an unfertilized egg cell or zygote with the nucleus of a differentiated cell. Can a nucleus derived from a differentiated cell direct development of an organism with all the proper tissues and organs? The pioneering experiments in nuclear transplantation were carried out by American embryologists Robert Briggs and Thomas King during the 1950s and were later extended by British embryologist John Gurdon. These investigators removed or destroyed the nucleus of a frog egg cell, then transplanted a nucleus from an embryonic or tadpole cell of the same species into the enucleated eggs (FIGURE 21.6). The ability of the transplanted nucleus to support normal development turned out to be inversely related to the age of the donor. In the case of nuclei from the relatively undifferentiated cells of an early embryo, most of the recipient eggs developed into tadpoles. But with nuclei from the differentiated intestinal cells of a tadpole, fewer than 2%  of the eggs developed into normal tadpoles, and most of the embryos failed to make it through even the earliest stages of development.

Fig 21-6. Nuclear transplantation.After the frog egg nucleus is destroyed by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a nucleus from a more advanced developmental stage is inserted into the egg to test whether nuclei change irreversibly as cells begin to differentiate. The earlier the developmental stage from which the nucleus comes, the more likely it will support development. Nuclei from very early embryonic stages frequently prove to be totipotent, whereas nuclei from late developmental stages (such as a tadpole) rarely are.

Developmental biologists agree on several conclusions about these results. First, nucleidochange in some way as cells differentiate. Although the base sequence of the DNA usually does not change, chromatin structure alters in specific ways (for example, the methylation of the DNA may change; see p. 363). In frogs and most other animals, nuclear "potency" tends to be restricted more and more as embryonic development and cell differentiation progress. However, biologists also agree that these chromatin changes are sometimes reversible and that the nuclei of most differentiated animal cells probably have all the genes required for making the entire organism. In other words, biologists believe that the cells of the body differ in structure and function not because they contain different genes, but because they express different portions of a common genome.

Researchers working with mammals have long been able to clone animals using nuclei or cells from a variety of early embryos, but until recently, it was not known whether the restriction of genomic potential in differentiated cells of an adult mammal could be reversed. However, in 1997, Scottish researcher Ian Wilmut and his colleagues captured newspaper headlines with the announcement that they had cloned an adult sheep by transplanting the nucleus from an udder (mammary) cell into an unfertilized egg cell from another sheep (FIGURE 21.7). They achieved the necessary dedifferentiation of the nucleus by culturing mammary cells in nutrient-poor medium, which led to arrest of the cell cycle (seeFIGURE 12.13). The cycle stopped at the G1checkpoint, and the cells entered a G0"resting" phase. The researchers then fused these cells with sheep egg cells whose nuclei had been removed. The resulting diploid cells divided to form early embryos, which the researchers implanted into surrogate mothers. One of several hundred of these embryos, they reported, successfully completed normal development. DNA analyses have since shown that the chromosomal DNA of this sheep, "Dolly," is indeed identical to that of the nucleus donor. (Later experiments showed that Dolly's mitochondrial DNA came from the egg cell donor, as we would expect.)

		Mammary cells were taken from the udder of a sheep and grown in culture with only low levels of nutrients. This semistarvation arrested the cell cycle in G0and apparently allowed the cells to dedifferentiate.
			  
		Meanwhile, an egg cell was taken from another sheep and its nucleus removed.
			  
		A mammary cell in G0was fused with the enucleated egg cell by subjecting the two cells to pulses of electrical current, which also stimulated the egg cell to start dividing.
			  
		After growing in culture for six days, the embryo
			  
		was implanted in the uterus of a third sheep, one similar to the egg cell donor.
			  
		The result after gestation was a lamb, Dolly, identical in appearance and in chromosome makeup to the sheep that had donated the mammary cell. (However, Dolly's genes cannot becompletelyidentical to those of the mammary cell donor because Dolly's mitochondrial DNA comes from the egg cell donor.) Dolly was the first reported case of a mammal "cloned" using the nucleus of a differentiated cell. The photograph shows Dolly with her surrogate mother.

In July 1998, researchers in Hawaii reported cloning mice using nuclei from mouse ovary cells, and since then, cloning has been demonstrated in numerous mammals, many important in agriculture. Cloning of farm animals raises safety issues for human consumers, and the possibility of human cloning raises unprecedented ethical issues. However, problems with the cloning process have bought us a little more time for thought. In most cases, only a tiny percentage of cloned embryos develop normally. Why is this? Recently, scientists have found a clue: The DNA of many cloned embryos is improperly methylated, often having extra methyl groups. Because DNA methylation helps regulate gene expression, and appropriate gene expression is key to embryonic development, it makes sense that misplaced methyl groups could interfere with development. Cloning difficulties highlight the fact that we still have much to learn about the basic principles and processes of development.

The Stem Cells of Animals

Another hot research area that depends on the genetic potential retained by animal cells during development involvesstem cells.These are cells with two important properties: As relatively unspecialized cells, they continually reproduce themselves; and under appropriate conditions, they differentiate into specialized cells of one or more types. The adult body has various kinds of stem cells, which serve to replace nonreproducing specialized cells as needed. For example, stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to all the different kinds of blood cells (seeFIGURE 42.15). Another example, whose discovery surprised the scientific world very recently, is stem cells in the adult brain that continue to produce certain kinds of nerve cells there. Stem cells that can give rise to multiple cell types are said to be multipotent or, more often,pluripotent.

Although adults have only tiny numbers of stem cells, scientists are learning to identify and isolate these cells from various tissues and, in some cases, to grow them in culture. Somewhat easier to culture are cells from early embryos, which are mostly "stem cells" that can give rise to differentiated cells of any type. Cultures of theseembryonic stem cellsare "immortal"; the cells reproduce indefinitely (using telomerase to maintain their chromosomal telomeres). Taking this research further, scientists have recently demonstrated that with the right culture conditions (for instance, the addition of specific growth factors), they can make cultured stem cells derived from either source differentiate into specialized cells. Surprisingly, adult stem cells can sometimes be made to differentiate into a wider range of cell types than they normally do in the animal (FIGURE 21.8).

Fig 21-8. Working with stem cells.Animal stem cells--self-perpetuating, relatively undifferentiated cells that can give rise to specialized cells of various types--can be isolated from early embryos or adult tissues and grown in culture. Researchers are seeking to discover the growth conditions that direct stem cells to differentiate into particular cell types.

In addition to providing a valuable means of studying differentiation, stem cell research has enormous potential for medical applications. The ultimate aim is to be able to supply cells for the repair of damaged or diseased organs. For example, providing insulin-producing pancreatic cells to diabetics or certain kinds of brain cells to people with Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease could conceivably cure these diseases. At the present time, embryonic cells are more promising than adult stem cells for such applications, but because the cells are derived from human embryos (commonly, surplus embryos donated by patients undergoing infertility treatment), their use raises ethical and political issues.

In the next section, we look at the molecular basis of cell differentiation.





 Different cell types make different proteins, usually as a result of transcriptional regulation

As the tissues and organs of an embryo take shape, differentiation of their cells becomes apparent; the cells become obviously different in structure and function. Cellular differentiation is actually the outcome of a cell's developmental history extending back to the first mitotic divisions of the zygote. However, the earliest changes that set a cell on a path to specialization are subtle ones, showing up only at the molecular level. Before biologists knew much about the molecular changes occurring in embryos, they coined the termdeterminationto refer to the process that leads up to the observable differentiation of a cell. At the point in the process when the cell is irreversibly committed to its final fate, it is said to be "determined." Today we understand determination in terms of molecular changes. The outcome of determination--differentiation--is heralded by the expression of genes that encodetissue-specific proteins, which are found only in a certain type of cell and give the cell its characteristic structure and function. The first evidence of differentiation is the appearance of the mRNA for these proteins. Eventually, differentiation is observable with a microscope as changes in cellular structure. In most cases, the pattern of gene expression in a differentiated cell--what proteins the cell makes--is controlled at the level of transcription.

Differentiated cells are specialists at making tissue-specific proteins. These are the proteins that allow them to carry out their specialized roles in the organism. Developing lens cells in vertebrates, for example, synthesize large quantities of crystallins, proteins that aggregate to form transparent fibers that give the lens the ability to transmit and focus light. Because no other vertebrate cell type makes crystallins, these proteins are signposts of lens cell differentiation. Lens cells devote 80%  of their capacity for protein synthesis to making this one type of protein.

The differentiation of skeletal muscle cells is another instructive example. The "cells" of skeletal muscle, which we use for walking and lifting and other voluntary movements, are long fibers containing many nuclei within a single plasma membrane. They contain very high concentrations of proteins specific to muscle tissue, such as muscle-specific versions of the contractile proteins myosin and actin and membrane receptor proteins that detect signals from nerve cells. Muscle cells develop from embryonic precursor cells that have the potential to develop into a number of alternative cell types, including cartilage cells or fat cells, but particular conditions commit them to becoming muscle cells. Although the committed cells appear unchanged under the microscope, determination has occurred, and they are nowmyoblasts. Eventually, myoblasts start to churn out large amounts of muscle-specific proteins and fuse to form mature, elongated, multinucleated skeletal muscle cells (FIGURE 21.9).

Fig 21-9. Determination and differentiation of muscle cells.This figure depicts a simplified version of how skeletal muscle cells arise from ordinary-looking embryonic cells that resemble fibroblasts (see the photo inFIGURE 12.15).
			  
		When this kind of embryonic precursor cell receives certain signals from other cells, a master control gene calledmyoDis activated, and the cell makes the MyoD protein. Although the appearance of the cell in the microscope does not change, determination has occurred: The activation ofmyoDcommits the cell, now called a myoblast, to becoming a skeletal muscle cell.
			  
		The MyoD protein is a transcription factor that activates genes encoding other muscle-specific transcription factors. MyoD also turns on genes such asp21that block the cell cycle and thus stop cell division. The various muscle-specific transcription factors activate the genes for muscle proteins such as myosin and actin. Meanwhile, the myoblasts fuse to become multinucleated mature muscle cells, also called muscle fibers.

What actually happens in muscle cell determination? Researchers have been able to answer this question by growing myoblasts in culture and applying some of the techniques you learned about in Chapter 20. To test the hypothesis that certain muscle-specific regulatory genes are active in myoblasts, researchers isolated mRNA from cultured myoblasts and used reverse transcriptase to prepare a library of genes in cDNA form (seeFIGURES 20.5and20.6)--intron-lacking versions of the genes expressed in myoblasts. In cloning the cDNA genes, the researchers positioned them next to a viral promoter that would turn on transcription in any kind of cell. The researchers then inserted each of the cloned genes into a separate embryonic precursor cell and looked for differentiation into myoblasts and muscle cells. In this way, they identified several crucial muscle determination genes, "master regulatory genes" that, when transcribed and translated, commit the cells to becoming skeletal muscle. Thus, in the case of muscle cells, the molecular basis of determination is the expression of one or more of these regulatory genes.

To understand more about how commitment occurs in muscle cell differentiation, let's focus on the master regulatory gene calledmyoD. Researchers learned that the protein product ofmyoD, called MyoD, is a transcription factor. It is a regulatory protein that binds to specific control elements in the DNA and stimulates the transcription of various genes, including some encoding still other muscle-specific transcription factors (see pp. 365-366). Presumably, all these target genes have enhancers recognized by MyoD and are thus coordinately controlled. Finally, the secondary transcription factors activate the muscle protein genes.

The MyoD protein is powerful. Researchers have been able to use it to change some kinds of fully differentiated nonmuscle cells, such as fat cells and liver cells, into muscle cells. Why doesn't it work onallkinds of cells? One likely explanation is that activation of the muscle-specific genes is not solely dependent on MyoD but requires a particularcombinationof regulatory proteins, some of which are lacking in cells that don't respond to MyoD. The determination and differentiation of other kinds of tissues may play out in a similar fashion.





 Transcriptional regulation is directed by maternal molecules in the cytoplasm and signals from other cells

Explaining the role ofmyoDin muscle cell differentiation is a long way from explaining the development of an organism. ThemyoDstory immediately raises the question of what triggers the expression ofthatgene and then raises a series of similar questions leading back to the zygote. What generates thefirstdifferences that arise among the cells in an early embryo? And what controls morphogenesis and the differentiation of all the different cell types as development proceeds? As we saw in the case of muscle cells, this question comes down to which genes are transcribed in the cells of a developing organism. Two sources of information "tell" a cell which genes to express at any given time.

One important source of information that operates early in development is the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg cell, which contains both RNA and protein molecules encoded by the mother's DNA. The cytoplasm of an egg cell and even its cytosolic fluid are not homogeneous. Messenger RNA, proteins, other substances, and organelles are distributed unevenly in the unfertilized egg, and this heterogeneity has a profound impact on the development of the future embryo in many species. After fertilization, the cell nuclei resulting from mitotic division of the zygote are exposed to different cytoplasmic environments. The maternal substances in the egg that influence the course of early development, calledcytoplasmic determinants,regulate the expression of genes that affect the developmental fate of the cells (FIGURE 21.10a).

Fig 21-10. Sources of developmental information for the early embryo.

The other important source of developmental information, which becomes increasingly important as the number of embryonic cells grows, is the environment around a cell. Most important are the signals impinging on an embryonic cell from other embryonic cells in the vicinity. The synthesis of the molecules conveying these signals is controlled by the embryo's own genes. The signal molecules cause changes in nearby target cells, a process calledinduction(FIGURE 21.10b). In general, the signal molecules induce the observable cellular changes by causing a change in gene expression in the target cells. Thus, interactions among embryonic cells eventually induce differentiation of the many specialized cell types making up a new organism. Induction may be accomplished by the diffusion of chemical signals or, if the cells are actually in contact, by cell surface interactions.

You'll learn more about cytoplasmic determinants and induction as we take a closer look at some important genetic and cellular mechanisms of development in three model organisms:Drosophila, C. elegans, andArabidopsis.





 Genetic analysis ofDrosophilareveals how genes control development:an overview

Pattern formation has been most extensively studied inDrosophila melanogaster, where genetic approaches have had spectacular success. These studies have established that genes control development and have led to an understanding of the key roles that specific molecules play in defining position and directing differentiation. Combining anatomical, genetic, and biochemical approaches to the study ofDrosophiladevelopment, researchers have discovered developmental principles common to many other species, including humans.

The Life Cycle of Drosophila

Fruit flies and other arthropods have a modular construction, an ordered series of segments. These segments make up the body's three major parts: the head, the thorax (midbody, from which the wings and legs extend), and the abdomen (seeFIGURE 21.11, bottom). Like other bilaterally symmetrical animals,Drosophilahas an anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis and a dorsal-ventral (back-belly) axis. InDrosophila, cytoplasmic determinants that are present in the unfertilized egg provide positional information for the placement of the two axes even before fertilization. After fertilization, positional information operating on a finer and finer scale establishes a specific number of correctly oriented segments and finally triggers the formation of each segment's characteristic structures.

Fig 21-11. Key developmental events in the life cycle ofDrosophila.In the top drawing, the yellow egg cell is surrounded by other cells, which form a structure called the follicle within one of the mother's ovaries. The egg cell grows as it matures and eventually fills the egg shell that is secreted by the follicle cells; the nurse cells shrink and disappear. The egg is fertilized within the mother and then laid. The embryo develops within the protective egg shell, as described in the text. The cell layer forming the equivalent of the blastula inDrosophilais called the blastoderm.

The developmental stages ofDrosophilaare illustrated inFIGURE 21.11. The egg cell develops in the mother's ovary, surrounded by ovarian cells called nurse cells and follicle cells. These supply the egg cell with nutrients and other substances needed for development and make the egg shell.
			  
		Following fertilization and laying of the egg, mitosis begins. The early mitotic divisions have two notable features. First, the amount of cytoplasm does not change; the first ten divisions, which occur very quickly, consist of S and M phases only, with no growth. Second, cytokinesis does not occur; the earlyDrosophilaembryo is one big multinucleated cell (in contrast to vertebrate embryos; see, for example, FIGURE 47.8).
			  
		At the tenth nuclear division, the nuclei begin to migrate to the periphery of the embryo, and
			  
		at division 13, plasma membranes finally partition the 6,000 or so nuclei into separate cells. Although not yet apparent under the microscope, the basic body plan--including body axes and segment boundaries--has already been determined by this time. A central yolk nourishes the embryo, and the egg shell continues to protect it.


			  
		Subsequent events in the embryo create clearly visible segments, which at first look very much alike.
			  
		Then, some cells move to new positions, organs form, and a wormlike larva (juvenile form) hatches out of the shell.Drosophilagoes through three larval stages, during which the larva eats, grows, and molts (sheds its tough outer layer),
			  
		eventually forming a pupa enclosed in a case.
			  
		Metamorphosis, the change from larva to adult fly, occurs inside the pupal case, and the fly emerges. In the adult, each segment is anatomically distinct, with characteristic appendages. For example, the first thoracic segment bears a pair of legs, the second thoracic segment has a pair of legs plus a pair of wings, and the third thoracic segment bears a pair of legs plus a pair of balancing organs called halteres.

Genetic Analysis of Early Development in Drosophila

During the first half of the 20th century, biologists made detailed anatomical observations of embryonic development in a number of species and performed experiments in which they manipulated embryonic tissues. This research laid the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of development. However, these "classical" embryologists were unable to identify the specific molecules that guide development or determine how patterns are established. In the 1940s, one visionary biologist, Edward B. Lewis, of Caltech, showed that a genetic approach--the study of mutants--could be used to investigateDrosophiladevelopment. Lewis studied bizarre mutants, flies with developmental defects that led to extra wings or legs in the wrong places (seeFIGURE 21.14). He located the mutations on the fly's genetic map, thus connecting the developmental abnormalities to specific genes. This research supplied the first concrete evidence that genes somehow direct the developmental processes studied by embryologists. The genes Lewis discovered control development in the late embryo; we'll return to them shortly.

Fig 21-14. Homeotic mutations and abnormal pattern formation inDrosophila.Homeotic mutations cause a misplacement of structures in an animal. These micrographs contrast the heads of two fruit flies (SEMs). Where small antennae are located in the normal fruit fly (left photo), one homeotic mutant has legs (right photo).

Meanwhile, the mystery of pattern formation during early development remained. But in the late 1970s, two researchers in Germany, Christiane Nmsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, undertook an ambitious quest that finally pushed the understanding of early pattern formation to the molecular level. These scientists set out to identifyallthe genes that affect segment formation inDrosophila. The project was daunting for several reasons. The first was the sheer number ofDrosophilagenes, about 13,000. The genes affecting segmentation might be just a few needles in a haystack or might be so numerous and varied that the scientists would be unable to make sense of them. Second, mutations affecting a process as fundamental as segmentation would surely beembryonic lethals,mutations with phenotypes leading to death at the embryo or larval stage. Because such mutant organisms never reproduce, they cannot be bred for study. Third, because cytoplasmic determinants in the egg were known to play a role in axis formation, the researchers would have to study maternal genes as well as those of the embryo.

N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus dealt with the problem of embryonic lethality by focusing their search on recessive mutations, which could be propagated in heterozygous flies. Their basic strategy was to expose flies to a mutagenic chemical to create mutations in the flies' gametes and then look among the flies' descendants for dead embryos or larvae with abnormal segmentation. By doing the appropriate crosses, they would be able to identify living heterozygotes carrying embryonic lethal mutations. To find as many segmentation genes as possible, they planned asaturation screen:They would make enough mutants to "saturate" the fly genome with mutations. The researchers hoped that the segmentation abnormalities visible in the dead embryos would suggest how the affected genes normally functioned.

After a year of laboriously performing thousands of crosses and examining thousands of dead embryos, N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus succeeded in identifying about 1,200 genes essential for embryonic development, of which about 120 were essential for pattern formation leading to normal segmentation. Over several years, they were able to group the genes by general function, to map them, and to clone many of them. The result was a detailed molecular understanding of the early steps in pattern formation inDrosophila. When their results were combined with Lewis's earlier work, a coherent picture ofDrosophiladevelopment emerged. In recognition of their discoveries, N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Wieschaus, and Lewis were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1995. Before we discuss how the segmentation genes function, we need to back up and look at the cytoplasmic determinants deposited in the egg by the mother, for these control the expression of the segmentation genes.





 Gradients of maternal molecules in the early embryo control axis formation

As previously mentioned, cytoplasmic determinants are the substances that initially establish the axes of theDrosophilabody. Already present in the unfertilized egg, they are encoded by genes of the mother calledmaternal effect genes.A maternal effect gene is a gene that, when mutant in the mother, results in a mutant phenotype in the offspring, regardless of their genotype. In fruit fly development, maternal effect genes encode proteins or mRNA that are placed in the egg while it is still in the mother's ovary. When the mother has a mutation in such a gene, she makes a defective gene product (or none at all), and her eggs are defective; when these eggs are fertilized, they fail to develop properly.

Because they control the orientation (polarity) of the egg and consequently of the fly, maternal effect genes are also calledegg-polarity genes.One group of these genes sets up the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo, while a second group establishes the dorsal-ventral axis. Like mutations in segmentation genes, mutations in these genes are generally embryonic lethals.

How do products of maternal effect genes determine the body axes of the offspring? Let's focus on one important egg-polarity gene,bicoid, and see how it works. The term bicoid means "two-tailed," and an embryo whose mother was defective in this gene lacks the front half of its body. Instead, the embryo has duplicate posterior structures at both ends (FIGURE 21.12a). This phenotype suggested the hypothesis that the product of the mother'sbicoidgene is essential for setting up the anterior end of the fly and that the gene's product is concentrated at the future anterior end. This hypothesis is a more specific version of thegradient hypothesisfirst proposed by embryologists a century ago. According to this idea, gradients of substances calledmorphogensestablish an embryo's axes and other features of its form.

Fig 21-12. The effect of thebicoidgene, a maternal effect (egg-polarity) gene inDrosophila.

DNA technology and other modern biochemical methods enabled researchers to test the hypothesis that thebicoidproduct is in fact a morphogen that determines the anterior end of the fly. The researchers cloned thebicoidgene and used it as a DNA probe to learn the location ofbicoidmRNA in the eggs produced by wild-type female flies. As predicted by the hypothesis, thebicoidmRNA is concentrated at the extreme anterior end of the egg cell (FIGURE 21.12b). After the egg is fertilized, the mRNA is translated into protein, which diffuses from the anterior end toward the posterior, resulting in a gradient of protein within the early embryo. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that bicoid protein was responsible for specifying the fly's anterior end. To test the hypothesis more specifically, the scientists injected purebicoidmRNA into various regions of early embryos. The protein that resulted from its translation caused anterior structures to form at the injection sites.

Thebicoidresearch is important for several reasons. First, it led to the identification of a specific protein required for some of the earliest steps in pattern formation. Second, it increased our understanding of the mother's role in the development of an embryo. (As one developmental biologist has put it, "Mom tells Junior which way is up.") Finally, the principle that a gradient of molecules can determine polarity and position has proved to be a key developmental concept, just as early embryologists had thought. InDrosophila, gradients of specific proteins determine the posterior end as well as the anterior and also are responsible for establishing the dorsal-ventral axis. Saturation screening has led to the identification of most of the genes and proteins involved.





 A cascade of gene activations sets up the segmentation pattern in Drosophila:a closer look

The bicoid protein and other morphogens that are products of egg-polarity genes are transcription factors, proteins that regulate the activity (transcription) of some of the embryo's own genes. Gradients of these morphogens bring about regional differences in the expression ofsegmentation genes,the genes of the embryo that direct the actual formation of segments after the embryo's major axes are defined.

In a cascade of gene activations, sequential activation of three sets of segmentation genes provides the positional information for increasingly fine details of the animal's modular body plan. First, products of thegap genesmap out the basic subdivisions along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (FIGURE 21.13a). Mutations in these genes cause "gaps" in the animal's segmentation. For example, one gap mutation results in an embryo lacking six abdominal segments.Pair-rule genesare the second set of segmentation genes to act. They define the modular pattern in terms of pairs of segments (FIGURE 21.13b. Mutations in pair-rule genes result in embryos having half the normal segment number because every other segment (odd or even, depending on the mutation) fails to develop. The third set of segmentation genes to act are thesegment polaritygenes, which set the anterior-posterior axis of each segment (FIGURE 21.13c). Embryos with mutations in segment polarity genes have the normal number of segments, but a part of each segment is replaced by a mirror-image repetition of some other part of the segment.

Fig 21-13. Segmentation genes inDrosophila.Soon after fertilization, once the mother's egg-polarity genes have set up the body axes, bicoid protein and other maternal gene products initiate a cascade of activity by segmentation genes in the embryo's nuclei. These micrographs of developing fly embryos illustrate successive bands of regulatory proteins encoded by segmentation genes. The proteins are DNA-binding transcription factors that direct the division of the body into the segments characteristic of flies and other arthropods. The colors result from fluorescent dyes on antibodies bound to the segmentation gene proteins.

The products of many of the segmentation genes, like those of egg-polarity genes, are transcription factors that directly activate the next set of genes in the hierarchical scheme of pattern formation. Other segmentation genes operate more indirectly, supporting the functioning of the transcription factors in various ways. For example, some are components of cell-signaling pathways, including signal molecules used in cell-cell communication and the membrane receptors that recognize them (see Chapter 11). Cell-signaling molecules are critically important once plasma membranes have divided the embryo into separate cellular compartments.

Working together, the products of egg-polarity genes regulate the regional expression of gap genes, which control the localized expression of pair-rule genes, which in turn activate specific segment polarity genes in different parts of each segment. The boundaries and axes of the segments are now set. In the hierarchy of gene activations responsible for pattern formation, the next genes to be expressed determine the specific anatomy of each segment along the embryo.





 Homeotic genes direct the identity of body parts

In a normal fly, structures such as antennae, legs, and wings develop on the appropriate segments. The anatomical identity of the segments is set by master regulatory genes calledhomeotic genes.These are the genes discovered by Edward Lewis. Once the segmentation genes have staked out the fly's segments, homeotic genes specify the types of appendages and other structures that each segment will form. Mutations in homeotic genes produce flies with such strange traits as legs growing from the head in place of antennae (FIGURE 21.14). Thus, as Lewis found, homeotic mutations cause structures characteristic of a particular part of the animal to arise in the wrong place.

Like many of the egg-polarity and segmentation genes preceding them in the developmental cascade, the homeotic genes encode transcription factors. These regulatory proteins control the expression of the genes responsible for specific anatomical structures. For example, a homeotic protein made in the cells of a particular thoracic segment may selectively activate genes that bring about leg development. In contrast, a homeotic protein active in a certain head segment specifies "antennae go here." A mutant version of this protein may label the segment as "thoracic" instead of "head," causing legs to develop in place of antennae. Scientists are now busy identifying the genes activated by the homeotic proteins--the genes specifying the proteins that actually build the fly structures. The following flowchart summarizes the cascade of gene activity in theDrosophilaembryo:





Amazingly, many of the molecules and mechanisms revealed by research on fly pattern formation have turned out to have close counterparts throughout the animal kingdom. And nowhere are the similarities more striking than in the homeotic genes and their products.





 Homeobox genes have been highly conserved in evolution

The homeotic genes ofDrosophilaall include a 180-nucleotide sequence called thehomeobox,which specifies a 60-amino-acidhomeodomain. An identical or very similar sequence of nucleotides has been discovered in genes of many other animals, including other insects, nematodes, mollusks, fish, frogs, birds, and mammals, including humans. (Homeobox-containing genes are often calledHoxgenes, especially in mammals.) Furthermore, related sequences have been found in regulatory genes of much more distantly related eukaryotes, such as yeast, and even in prokaryotes. From these similarities we can deduce that the homeobox DNA sequence evolved very early in the history of life and that it is sufficiently valuable to organisms to have been conserved in animals virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. In fact, the vertebrate genes homologous to the homeotic genes of fruit flies have even kept their chromosomal arrangement (FIGURE 21.15, p. 418).

Fig 21-15. Homologous genes that affect pattern formation in a fruit fly and a mouse.Homeotic homeobox-containing genes that control the form of the anterior and posterior structures of the body occur in the same linear sequence on chromosomes inDrosophilaand mice. Each small box on the chromosomes shown here represents a homeobox-containing gene. In fruit flies, all of these genes are found on one chromosome. The mouse and other mammals have the same or similar sets of genes on four chromosomes. The color code indicates the parts of the embryos in which these genes are expressed and the adult body regions that result. Purple, green, gray, and orange boxes represent genes with homeoboxes that are essentially identical in flies and mice. Black boxes represent genes with homeoboxes that are less similar in the two animals. In vertebrates, homeobox-containing genes are often calledHox genes.

Not all homeobox-containing genes are homeotic genes; that is, some do not directly control the identity of body parts. However, most of these genes are associated with development, suggesting their ancient and fundamental importance in that process. For example, inDrosophila, homeoboxes are present not only in the homeotic genes but also in the egg-polarity genebicoid, in several of the segmentation genes, and in the master regulatory gene for eye development (see the photograph at the beginning of the chapter).

What is the role of the homeodomain in a protein? This polypeptide segment is the part of the protein that binds to DNA when the protein functions as a transcription factor. (The homeodomain forms three a helices, one of which fits neatly into the major groove of the DNA helix.) However, the shape of the homeodomain allows it to bind to any DNA segment; by itself it cannot select a specific sequence. It is other, more variable domains of such a protein that determine which genes the protein regulates. These latter domains interact with other transcription factors that help the protein recognize specific enhancers or promoters in the DNA. Proteins with homeodomains probably regulate development by coordinating the transcription of batteries of developmental genes, switching them on or off (FIGURE 21.16). InDrosophilaembryos, different combinations of homeobox genes are active in different parts of the embryo. This selective expression of regulatory genes, varying over time and space, is central to pattern formation.

Fig 21-16. Homeobox-containing genes as switches.How a particular cell differentiates in the animal's body depends on how many of these switches are thrown--that is, which homeobox proteins are made within the cell. A single master switch may control a number of subordinate switches, which in turn control others. Here the wires represent the actions of the proteins that are the products of the genes.





 Neighboring cells instruct other cells to form particular structures: cell signaling and induction in the nematode

The development of a multicellular organism requires close communication among cells. Even when theDrosophilaembryo is still one multinucleated "cell," signaling between cells has already played a key role. For example, an exchange of signals between the unfertilized egg cell and neighboring follicle cells guided the establishment of the egg's anterior end; it was a follicle cell signal that triggered the localization ofbicoidmRNA there. Once the embryo is truly multicellular, signaling among the embryo's own cells becomes increasingly important. In the process called induction, cells signal nearby cells to change in some specific way, often by expressing particular genes. As we've seen, the ultimate basis for the differences among cells is transcriptional regulation--the turning on and off of specific genes. It is induction, signaling from one group of cells to an adjacent group, that brings about differentiation.

Induction in Vulval Development

The nematodeC. eleganshas proved to be a very useful model organism for investigating the roles of cell signaling and induction in development. Particularly revealing has been research on the development of the nematodevulva, the tiny opening through which the worm lays its eggs. Researchers have combined genetic, biochemical, and embryological approaches to learn how this organ forms.

The pathway from fertilized egg to an adult nematode capable of reproduction involves four larval stages (the larvae look much like smaller versions of the adult). Already present on the ventral surface of the second-stage larva are six cells from which the vulva will arise (FIGURE 21.17a). A single cell of the embryonic gonad, theanchor cell, initiates a cascade of signals that establishes the fates of the vulval precursor cells. If an experimenter destroys the anchor cell with a laser beam, the vulva fails to form and the precursor cells simply become part of the worm's epidermis.

Fig 21-17. Cell signaling and induction in the development of the nematode vulva.The vulva is the opening through which the nematode lays its eggs.

Researchers have figured out the molecular details of vulval induction by isolating mutants in which vulval development is abnormal. Such mutants can grow to adulthood because a normal egg-laying apparatus is not essential for viability. The phenotypes of the mutants range from multiple vulvae to none at all. (In the latter mutants, offspring develop internally within self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, eventually eating their way out of the parent's body!) From studying the mutants, researchers have identified a number of genes involved in vulval development and have worked out where and how their products function (FIGURE 21.17b).

The anchor cell secretes an inducer, a signal protein that binds to a receptor protein in the plasma membrane of vulval precursor cells. (An example of the "unity of life," this signal protein is very similar to theepidermal growth factor (EGF)of humans and other mammals.) At the start, all the precursor cells are equivalent: All make a basic set of proteins necessary for vulval formation, including receptors for the anchor cell's signal molecules. However, these cells do not all respond to the inducer. The cell that normally becomes the inner part of the vulva receives high levels of inducer, since it is closest to the anchor cell. The high levels of inducer probably produce two effects: (1) division and differentiation of the cell to form the inner part of the vulva and (2) activation of a gene for a cell surface signaling protein, which acts as a second inducer. Receptors on the two adjacent vulval precursor cells bind the second inducer, which stimulates these cells to divide and develop into the outer vulva. The three remaining vulval precursor cells are too far away to receive either signal; they give rise to epidermal cells.

The inducer released by the anchor cell and the signal-transduction pathway it triggers in the closest vulval precursor cell are similar to ones you have encountered in previous chapters. The signal is a growth-factor-like protein, and it is transduced within its target cell via a tyrosine-kinase receptor, a Ras protein, and a cascade of protein kinases--a common pathway leading to transcriptional regulation in many organisms (seeFIGURE 19.14a). (The nematode research provided the firstin vivoevidence linking the Ras pathway with a growth factor.)

In summary, vulval development in the nematode illustrates a number of important concepts that apply elsewhere in the development ofC. elegansand many other animals:

In the developing embryo, sequential inductions drive the formation of organs.

The effect of an inducer can depend on its concentration (just as we saw with cytoplasmic determinants inDrosophila).

Inducers produce their effects via signal-transduction pathways similar to those operating in adult cells.

The induced cell's response is often the activation (or inactivation) of genes--transcriptional regulation--which, in turn, establishes the pattern of gene activity characteristic of a particular kind of differentiated cell.

Genetics is a powerful approach for elucidating the mechanisms of development.

Programmed Cell Death (Apoptosis)

Lineage analysis ofC. eleganshas highlighted another outcome of cell signaling that is crucial in animal development--programmed cell death, orapoptosis.The timely suicide of cells occurs exactly 131 times in the course ofC. elegans's normal development. At precisely the same points in each new worm's cell lineage, signals trigger the activation of a cascade of "suicide" proteins in the cells destined to die. The cells shrink, their nuclei condense and then break down, and neighboring cells quickly engulf and digest the remains, leaving no trace (FIGURE 21.18a).

Genetic screening ofC. eleganshas revealed two key apoptosis genes,ced-3andced-4(cedstands for "cell death"), which encode proteins essential for apoptosis. The proteins are called Ced-3 and Ced-4, respectively. These and most other proteins involved in apoptosis are continually present in cells, but in inactive form; thus, proteinactivityis regulated in this case, not transcription or translation. A protein called Ced-9 (the product of geneced-9) is the master regulator of apoptosis (FIGURE 21.18b). The apoptosis pathway activates proteases and nucleases, enzymes that cut up the proteins and DNA of the cell. The main proteases of apoptosis are calledcaspases; in the nematode, the chief caspase is Ced-3.

Apoptosis pathways in humans and other mammals are more complicated. Notably, research on mammals has revealed a prominent role for mitochondria in apoptosis, at least in these more complex animals. Apoptosis pathway proteins or other signals somehow cause the mitochondrial outer membrane to leak, releasing proteins that promote apoptosis. (Surprisingly, these include cytochromec, whose cellular function was thought to have been limited to electron transport; seeFIGURE 9.15). Still controversial is whether mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis or only a subsidiary role. The answer may vary with the circumstance. In any case, a cell must make life-or-death "decisions" by somehow integrating the signals it receives, both "death" signals and "life" signals such as growth factors.

A built-in cell suicide mechanism is essential to development in all animals, and similarities between apoptosis genes in nematodes and mammals indicate that the basic mechanism evolved early in animal evolution. The timely activation of apoptosis proteins in some cells functions in normal development and growth in both embryos and adults. In vertebrates, programmed cell death is essential for normal development of the nervous system, for normal operation of the immune system, and for the normal morphogenesis of human hands and feet. In the last case, the failure of normal cell death can result in webbed fingers and toes. Researchers are also investigating the possibility that certain degenerative diseases of the nervous system result from the inappropriate activation of apoptosis genes and that some cancers result from a failure of cell suicide. Cells that have suffered irreparable damage, including DNA damage that could lead to cancer, normally generateinternalsignals that trigger apoptosis.





 Plant development depends on cell signaling and transcriptional regulation

The last common ancestor of plants and animals was probably a single-celled microbe living hundreds of millions of years ago, so the processes of development must have evolved independently in the two lineages of organisms. Plants evolved with rigid cell walls that make the movement of cells and tissue layers virtually impossible, ruling out a morphogenetic mechanism that is important in animals. Plant morphogenesis relies more heavily on differing planes of cell division and on selective cell enlargement. (You will learn about these processes in Chapter 35.)

But despite the differences between plants and animals, there are some basic similarities in their molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms of development--legacies of their shared cellular origins. In particular, plant development, like that of animals, depends on cell signaling (induction) and transcriptional regulation.

We are just beginning to understand the molecular basis of plant development in detail. Thanks to DNA technology, clues from animal research, and model organisms such asArabidopsis, plant research is now progressing rapidly. The embryonic development of most plants occurs inside the seed and is relatively inaccessible to study (a mature seed already contains a fully formed embryo). However, other important aspects of plant development are observable throughout the plant's life in its meristems, and in particular in the apical meristems at the tips of shoots. It is there that cell division, morphogenesis, and differentiation give rise to new organs, such as leaves or the petals of flowers. We'll discuss two examples of research on floral meristems, the apical meristems that produce flowers.

Cell Signaling in Flower Development

Environmental signals, such as day length and temperature, trigger signal-transduction pathways that convert ordinary shoot meristems to floral meristems. Researchers have combined a genetic approach with tissue transplantation to study induction in the development of tomato flowers. As shown inFIGURE 21.19a(p. 422), a floral meristem is a "bump" consisting of three layers of cells (L1-L3). All three layers participate in the formation of a flower, a reproductive structure with four types of organs: carpels (containing egg cells), petals, stamens (containing sperm-bearing pollen), and sepals (leaflike structures outside the petals).

Fig 21-19. Induction in flower development.

Researchers discovered that tomato plants homozygous for a mutant allele calledfasciated(f)produce flowers with an abnormally large number of organs. Taking advantage of the totipotency of plant cells, they performed an experiment in which they grafted stems from this mutant onto wild-type plants and then grew new plants from the shoots that emerged at the graft sites. The new plants werechimeras,organisms with a mixture of genetically different cells. Some of the chimeras produced floral meristems in which the three cell layers did not all come from the same "parent" (FIGURE 21.19b). The researchers could identify the parental sources of the meristem layers by monitoring other genetic markers, such as an unrelated mutation that caused yellow leaves. They found that the number of organs per flower depends on the genes of the L3 (innermost) cell layer, which somehow induces the overlaying layers L2 and L1 to form that number of organs. The mechanism of cell-cell signaling leading to this induction is not yet known.

Organ Identity Genes in Plants

In contrast to genes controlling organnumberin flowers are genes controlling organidentity. Anorgan identity genedetermines the type of structure that will grow from a meristem--for instance, whether a particular outgrowth from a floral meristem becomes a petal or a stamen. Most of what we know about plant organ identity genes comes from research on flower development inArabidopsis. Organ identity genes are analogous to homeotic genes in animals and are often referred to as plant homeotic genes. Just as a mutation in a fruit fly homeotic gene can cause legs to grow in place of antennae, a mutation in a plant organ identity gene can cause carpels to grow in place of sepals.

By collecting and studying mutants with abnormal flowers, researchers have been able to identify and clone a number of floral organ identity genes, and they are beginning to determine how they act. To follow their work, we need a top view of the floral meristem (FIGURE 21.20a). Viewed from above, the meristem can be divided into four concentric circles, or whorls, each of which develops into a circle of identical organs. The organ-identity genes first identified fell into three classes (A,B, andC), each of which affects two adjacent whorls. A simple model, diagrammed inFIGURE 21.20a, explains how these three kinds of genes can direct the formation of the four types of organs.

Fig 21-20. Organ-identity genes and pattern formation in flower development.This is a model for how genes specify the floral organs inArabidopsis, with some supporting evidence.

This model (hypothesis) predicts that each organ identity gene will be transcribed in two specific whorls of the floral meristem, and once the genes were cloned, the predictions could be tested. Using nucleic acid from cloned genes as probes, researchers showed that the mRNA resulting from the transcription of each class of organ identity gene is present in the appropriate whorls of the developing floral meristem. For example, nucleic acid from aCgene hybridized appreciably only to cells in whorls 3 and 4 because only those cells were making RNA complementary to it (FIGURE 21.20b).

The model also can account for the phenotypes of mutants lackingA,B, orCgene activity with one addition: WhereAgene activity is present, it inhibitsC, and vice versa; if eitherAorCis missing, the other, not inhibited, takes its place.FIGURE 21.20cshows the floral patterns of mutants lacking each of the three classes of organ identity genes and explains how the model accounts for the floral phenotypes.

Further testing of this model and other hypotheses led in 2001 to the discovery of a fourth class of organ identity genes, termed classE. This discovery, combined with studies of the genes and gene products at the molecular level, is allowing researchers to extend and refine the older model.

Presumably the organ identity genes are acting as master regulatory genes, each controlling the activity of a battery of other genes that more directly bring about an organ's structure and function. Indeed, like the homeotic genes of animals, the organ identity genes of plants encode transcription factors that regulate other genes by binding to specific enhancers or promoters in the DNA. The plant genes, however, do not contain the homeobox DNA sequence that characterizes homeotic genes in animals. Instead, they have a sequence that encodes a different DNA-binding domain. Possibly as ancient as the homeobox, this sequence is also present in some transcription factor genes in yeast and animals.

The more scientists learn about the molecules and mechanisms of development in different organisms, the more striking are the underlying similarities that emerge. The similarities reflect the unity--the common ancestry--of life on Earth. But the differences are also crucial, for they have created the huge diversity of organisms that have evolved.

The remainder of the book goes beyond molecules, cells, and genes to explore life on the organismal level.
