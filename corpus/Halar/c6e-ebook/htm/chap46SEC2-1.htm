In most cases, asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell division. <span class="Emphasis2">Sexual reproduction</span> is the creation of offspring by the fusion of haploid <span class="Emphasis2">gametes</span> to form a <span class="Emphasis2">zygote</span> (fertilized egg), which is diploid. Gametes are formed by meiosis (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.7</span>). The female gamete, the <span class="Emphasis2">ovum</span> (unfertilized egg), is usually a relatively large and nonmotile cell. The male gamete, the <span class="Emphasis2">spermatozoon,</span> is generally a small, motile cell. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variability among offspring by generating unique combinations of genes inherited from two parents. By producing offspring having various phenotypes, sexual reproduction may enhance the reproductive success of parents when pathogens or other environmental factors change relatively rapidly.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
