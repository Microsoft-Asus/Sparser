CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A delegation of Nigerian cabinet ministers flew to Libya on Thursday , violating a U.N. ban on flights to the North African country , Egypt 's Middle East News Agency reported .
Nigeria 's foreign and water ministers , along with other officials , were the latest to fly into the Libyan capital Tripoli since <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">the Organization of African Unity last June decided to ignore the sanctions</ENAMEX> .
Earlier this month , five African presidents flew to Tripoli for celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to power .
The Nigerians ' visit is expected to last several days , MENA said .
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
In addition to the flight ban , the sanctions also bar arms sales , freeze some foreign assets and limit sales of oil industry equipment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Libya this week asked the Arab League in Cairo to join the OAU in ignoring the sanctions</ENAMEX> .
But the 22-member league late Wednesday said it would not agree to suspend the sanctions until an agreement is reached with Libya on handing over the suspects .
The United States and Britain last month said they would accept a trial of the suspects in the Netherlands with Scottish judges .
Libya agreed in principle , but has demanded negotiations to ensure the suspects ' legal rights and safety .
The United States and Britain have said the offer is non-negotiable .
The U.N. Security Council said the sanctions would be lifted when the suspects were turned over for trial .
