THE PRINCIPLES OF ENERGY HARVEST

 

 Cellular respiration and fermentation are catabolic, energy-yielding pathways



 

 Cells recycle the ATP they use for work



 

 Redox reactions release energy when electrons move closer to electronegative atoms



 

 Electrons "fall" from organic molecules to oxygen during cellular respiration



 

 The "fall" of electrons during respiration is stepwise, via NAD+ and an electron transport chain



In harvesting chemical energy, cells usually employ metabolic pathways with many steps. Fortunately, we can organize this complexity with the help of just a handful of general principles. The first part of this chapter develops these principles, which will then enable you to make sense of cellular respiration and related pathways.
