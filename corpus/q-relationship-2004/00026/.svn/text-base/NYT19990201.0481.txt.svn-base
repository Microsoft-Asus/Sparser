-LRB- Undated -RRB- The Clinton administration has backed off a proposal to pay the financially ailing Russians up to $ 600 million over the next few years to preserve their participation in the U.S. -led international space station , NASA administrator Dan Goldin said Monday as he previewed the agency 's proposed $ 13.6 billion budget .
When introduced publicly last fall as part of a three-step strategy to deal with shortfalls in Russian spending on the project , the proposal drew only lukewarm support from lawmakers .
Many within NASA , which is faced with its own cost overruns , were even less pleased .
In spite of a $ 60 million NASA payment to the Russians in late 1998 to ensure the launching of the new station 's crucial and long-delayed service module by the end of July , the problems persist .
Additionally , the Russians are proposing to keep their 13-year -old Mir space station in orbit for another three years in spite of pledges to NASA that it would send the outpost plunging into the ocean by the end of 1999 to free up funds for the new station .
`` After conferring with the administration and the Congress , we have decided we are going to put zero dollars beyond 1999 at this point in time , '' Goldin said Monday .
The federal government 's fiscal 1999 budget year began last Oct. 1 .
`` We believe it would be inappropriate at this time to specify or put that money in the budget because it ` disincentives ' the Russian government to fund the Russian Space Agency , '' he said .
The decision to hold the funds could be reversed .
`` We will monitor the situation closely , '' Goldin added .
In exchange for last year 's $ 60 million NASA payment , Russian agreed to give the Americans research and storage space aboard their service module , which is to provide the initial living quarters on the new station .
The United States was counting on those funds to pay for the final components and pre-launch testing of the service module as well as initial parts for the new Soyuz crew transport and Progress cargo capsules pledged by the Russians .
In January , NASA said the Russians would be unable to launch the service module before the end of September , 17 months later than promised .
Engineering assessments next month in Moscow will determine whether further slips are likely .
Assembly of the station , which eventually will have European , Japanese , Canadian and Russian contributions , began in November and December with the launches of the Russian -built , U.S. -financed control module and an American shuttle-launched compartment that will link future components furnished by the two countries .
Goldin said Monday that NASA 's proposed $ 13.6 billion budget for the year 2000 includes adequate funding for the United States to cut its reliance on Russian space station participation .
In all , according to Goldin , NASA has been forced to find $ 1.2 billion so far to deal with Russia 's station lapses .
The money has come from a slowdown in the production of research gear for the station , a cut in the number of shuttle launches due to station construction delays and the recent cancellation of a major effort to develop a modern supersonic airliner .
