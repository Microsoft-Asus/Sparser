AUSTIN , Texas --
Vowing to place Texas at the forefront of curbing prison gangs , state prison officials are developing new programs to entice convicts to renounce their gang membership and to reduce gang violence .
Some elements of the new program , officials said , could parallel those in a successful anti-gang program adopted four years ago in Connecticut prisons , as well as programs that have worked in other states .
`` This is a very real and very ominous problem , '' said Allan Polunsky , chairman of the prison system 's governing board , `` and we are looking at whatever measures are appropriate to deal with it . ''
Wayne Scott , executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice that runs the 143,500-convict prison system , said officials began studying new anti-gang initiatives several weeks ago and hope to have the new program in operation within the next year .
`` We are in the developmental stage right now , starting from scratch to look at what has worked in other states and what has not , '' Scott said .
`` Whatever we do will be a pilot program .
If it 's successful , we will expand it . ''
Other prison officials said the anti-gang initiative , parts of which were announced in Austin recently , will include plans to make Texas a national clearinghouse for information about prison gangs via police computers and intelligence files .
Officials estimate there are 5,000 confirmed gang members inside Texas prisons -- plus thousands of others suspected of gang membership .
Gang networks have become an increasing security problem inside prisons and a crime problem outside prisons .
After a three-month investigation , the Austin American - Statesman detailed the problems in a series published last weekend .
The investigation found that racism has made prison gangs grow faster than the overall convict population , and that gangs are being segregated from one another in an attempt to control them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The gangs also have begun recruiting members of teen-age street gangs to help them run criminal enterprises , including drug trafficking , outside of prison</ENAMEX> .
Scott said prison officials are researching anti-gang programs in other states to develop Texas ' new efforts , which Polunsky said probably will include first-of-a-kind educational programs to get gang members to renounce their membership .
Facing a growing gang problem , Connecticut prisons implemented similar programs in 1994 .
Capt. Luis Arizarry , an intelligence chief for Connecticut Department of Corrections , said that once convicts are confirmed to be gang members they are isolated from other convicts -- as they are in Texas .
Housed in maximum-security prisons with other members of the same gang , they are placed on regimented schedules and mandated to attend classes that focus on anger management , cultural and ethnic diversity , even sessions on why they should renounce their gang membership .
If convicts refuse to participate , Arizarry said , they are placed in solitary-confinement cells where they cannot earn time credits for good behavior and have limited access to visitors , among other restrictions .
Gang members who renounce their affiliation and successfully complete the first part of the program are then moved to another prison with fewer restrictions .
But they must continue to toe the line and not restart their gang activity , Arizarry said .
To make sure , he said , `` we monitor everything they do . ''
The last part of the Connecticut program entails moving the convicts into a prison where they are housed with members of rival gangs .
If they successfully complete that phase of the program , and officials are assured they are out of the gang , they can then be moved into a regular prison to complete the rest of their sentence , Connecticut officials said .
Arizarry said that , at present , about 900 of Connecticut 's 16,000 convicts are gang members .
In four years , only 32 of the 500 convicts who have gone through the gang-renunciation program have re-affiliated , he said .
`` If a program like this implemented correctly , it will work , '' Arizarry said Scott said Texas officials want to develop a similar pattern of success , even though Connecticut 's program by itself `` does not appear a good fit with our offenders . ''
The reasons , other officials said , are that Texas ' prison gangs have deeper and more criminal roots than the nine gangs in Connecticut , and prisons there operate under different rules and laws than those in Texas .
For example , Connecticut conducts hearings when it labels a convict a gang offender .
Texas does not .
Even so , he said Texas officials are looking to use parts from it and successful anti-gang programs in other states to develop new programs for Texas prisons .
`` The element of renunciation that Connecticut employs is what we 're after , '' Polunsky said .
`` We 're open to any and all ideas .
We want something that will work in Texas . ''
