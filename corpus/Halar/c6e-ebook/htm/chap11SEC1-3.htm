One benefit of such pathways is the possibility of greatly amplifying a signal. If some of the molecules in a pathway transmit the signal to multiple molecules of the next component in the series, the result can be a large number of activated molecules at the end of the pathway. In other words, a small number of extracellular signal molecules can produce a large cellular response. Moreover, multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation than simpler systems do, as we’ll discuss later.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
