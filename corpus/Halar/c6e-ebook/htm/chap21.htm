The application of genetic analysis and DNA technology to the study of development has brought about a revolution in the field. In much the same way that researchers have used mutations to deduce pathways of cellular metabolism, they now use mutations to dissect developmental pathways. In one striking example, Swiss researchers demonstrated in 1995 that a particular gene functions as a master switch that triggers the development of the eye in</span>Drosophila.<span class="Emphasis1">The scanning electron micrograph on this page shows the head of an abnormal fly with small extra eyes on its antennae. Expression of the master gene for eye development in an abnormal location in the fly caused the extra eyes. A similar gene triggers eye development in mice and other mammals. In fact, developmental biologists are discovering remarkable similarities in the mechanisms that shape diverse organisms</span>.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The scientific study of development got under way about a century ago, around the same time as genetics. But for decades the two disciplines proceeded along mostly separate paths. We have seen how geneticists advanced from Mendel’s laws to an understanding of the molecular basis of inheritance. Meanwhile, developmental biologists focused on embryology, the study of the stages of development leading from fertilized egg to fully formed organism. Only in recent years have the concepts and tools of molecular genetics reached the point where a real synthesis has been possible. The synthesis is a challenge, for it means relating the linear information in genes to a process of development that takes place in four dimensions, three of space and one of time</span>.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">This chapter introduces some of the basic genetic and cellular mechanisms that control development. It focuses on principles that apply to both animals and plants, with emphasis on two invertebrate animals: the fruit fly</span>Drosophila melanogaster<span class="Emphasis1">and the nematode</span>Caenorhabditis elegans.<span class="Emphasis1">In later chapters, you will learn much more about the development of plants (Chapter 35) and animals (Chapter 47)</span>.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">A capstone to the genetics unit, this chapter also serves as a bridge to the rest of the book, for understanding development is crucial to understanding the evolution, diversity, structure, function, and ecology of organisms</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
