Structures within the cell help bring order to metabolic pathways. In some cases, a team of enzymes for several steps of a metabolic pathway is assembled together as a multienzyme complex. The arrangement controls the sequence of reactions, as the product from the first enzyme becomes substrate for the adjacent enzyme in the complex, and so on, until the end product is released. Some enzymes and enzyme complexes have fixed locations within the cell as structural components of particular membranes. Others are in solution within specific membrane-enclosed eukaryotic organelles, each with its own internal chemical environment. For example, in eukaryotic cells the enzymes for cellular respiration reside within mitochondria (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.21</span>). If the cell had the same number of enzyme molecules for respiration but they were diluted throughout the entire volume of the cell, respiration would be very inefficient.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig6-21','../fig/big/fig6-21.jpg','fig6-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig6-21.jpg" alt="fig6-21" name="myfig6-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 6-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Organelles and structural order in metabolism.</span> Membranes partition a eukaryotic cell into various metabolic compartments, or organelles, each with a corps of enzymes that carry out specific functions.
