-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The United Nations has announced new age requirements for U.N. peacekeepers , hoping to set an example for countries to refrain from using children under 18 in their own forces .
The United Nations announced Thursday that civilian police and military observers sent by governments to serve in U.N. peacekeeping operations should be at least 25 .
Troops in national contingents should preferably be 21 but no younger than 18 , the under-secretary general for peacekeeping , Bernard Miyet , told the General Assembly .
`` This decision has been taken as an additional measure in the organization 's effort to promote the rights of the child , '' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said .
`` While we have no indication that member governments have provided the U.N. with soldiers under the age of 18 , this policy has been adopted as a proactive measure , '' he said .
U.N. officials said the United States was an indirect target of the new decree since Washington allows 17-year -olds in the U.S. armed forces .
Human Rights Watch applauded the move , saying it was a step in the right direction .
The use of child combatants has become one of the most devastating aspects of contemporary warfare , with more than 300,000 children under 18 currently fighting around the world , said Jo Becker , the organization 's children 's rights advocacy director .
`` National governments should be doing everything possible to stop this horrible practice .
Raising their enlistment age to 18 is one important move , '' Becker said .
The U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict , Olara Otunnu , also welcomed the decision , saying `` it will strengthen current efforts to promote better protection for the most vulnerable sections of the population in peacekeeping situations . ''
