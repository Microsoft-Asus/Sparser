CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULATIONS

 

 Two important characteristics of any population are density and the spacing of individuals



 

 Demography is the study of factors that affect the growth and decline of populations



A population is a group of individuals of a single species that simultaneously occupy the same general area. They rely on the same resources, are influenced by similar environmental factors, and have a high likelihood of breeding with and interacting with one another. The characteristics of a population are shaped by interactions between individuals and their environments, and natural selection can modify these characteristics.
