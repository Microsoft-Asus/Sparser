ALMATY , Kazakhstan --
With Kazakhstan 's strategic ties with the United States at risk over the sale of MIG jet fighters to North Korea , the Kazakh president has ordered a series of arrests , reformed the government 's arms export system and dismissed his closest confidante and adviser .
In an interview that focused on the recent sale , Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said the government was aware that the sale of some 40 MIG jets to North Korea had endangered its crucial relationship with the United States .
Washington considers North Korea a rogue state for its support of international terrorism .
`` We are disappointed , unhappy and frustrated with what happened with this incident , '' Tokayev said .
`` But what happened has happened , and the president is determined to punish those who failed to control the export of conventional arms . ''
Yet , in a development that further complicated the two nations ' relationship , the Russian police late Friday detained Kazakhstan 's main opposition leader , former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin , on an extradition request by the Kazakh authorities .
U.S. diplomats met Saturday with Russian and Kazakh officials `` to tell them we were very concerned about it and that it did n't look good , '' a State Department official said .
Kazhegeldin , 47 , who lives in exile in Europe , was detained on arrival in Moscow on a flight from London .
He was later moved under police guard to a Moscow hospital after suffering what his aides said were heart palpitations .
The Russian authorities said they were undecided whether to extradite Kazhegeldin , whom the Kazakh authorities accuse of tax evasion and corruption .
A lawyer for Kazhegeldin , Charles Both , denied the charges .
The incident occurred one day after the government refused Kazhegeldin a place on the ballot for Kazakh national elections to be held Oct. 10 .
The government asserted that Kazhegeldin had failed to register properly .
The U.S. authorities last month learned of the transfer of the MIGs , 1960s-era fighters that are still effective in an arena like the Korean peninsula .
The transfer has forced the Clinton administration to consider cutting off annual assistance of at least $ 75 million .
Since the 1991 Soviet breakup , Kazakhstan has maintained a very close relationship with Washington , leading the way in the elimination of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
In addition , President Nursultan Nazarbayev has become one of the Clinton administration 's closest allies in the region .
But the MIG controversy comes at a time of tension between the two countries over Nazarbayev 's six-month -old crackdown on his political opposition and his promotion of close relatives to key government posts .
Just last week , Nazarbayev appointed a son-in-law , Rakhat Aliev , as a deputy chief of the successor service to the KGB in charge of the Almaty region , giving him the rank of major general .
Aliev is a vehement critic of Kazhegeldin , the former prime minister , and has helped lead a long government effort to discredit him .
While defending Nazarbayev 's progress on democratization and his record on appointments , Tokayev , the foreign minister , said concern over the MIG transfer had risen to such high levels that Vice President Al Gore had discussed the transfer with the Kazakh president in a telephone conversation last month .
He said they had agreed to a joint U.S. - Kazakh investigation into who was responsible for the $ 8 million sale .
Tokayev asserted that the Russian government was not involved in the sale , but said that at least two Russian officials -- including Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow , a leading candidate to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin -- had intervened in the affair .
Last month , the Clinton administration learned that a trainload of disassembled MIGs had been shipped from Kazakhstan to North Korea .
That followed a similar incident on March 19 , when another former Soviet republic , Azerbaijan , announced that it had impounded a cargo plane with its Russian and Ukrainian crew from Kazakhstan carrying six disassembled MIG fighters ; crewmen on the plane said they were headed to North Korea .
In addition to its previously announced dismissal of two senior officials -- including Nurtai Abukayev , head of the state Committee on National Security and Nazarbayev 's closest confidante -- Tokayev said the government had arrested about 12 people , including subordinates of Abukayev .
Tokayev said he did not believe that Abukayev had personally benefited from the sale , but that the president had asked for his friend 's resignation because he had failed to control Kazakhstan 's arms cache .
He said the president had revoked the conventional arms sale licenses of all private companies and the supervisory role of the Ministry of Defense in such sales .
From now on , he said , these sales will be overseen by the office of the prime minister , who until now has been regarded as a comparatively weak figure .
U.S. law prescribes sanctions against countries that provide `` lethal military assistance '' to any of seven nations that Washington considers sponsors of terrorism .
The State Department has a range of options , from waiving sanctions to halting all assistance .
Some supporters of Kazakhstan in Washington have complained that the administration is trying to make an example of the Central Asian republic , a relatively weak state whose independence from Russia is guaranteed by Washington , while it routinely waives sanctions against Moscow .
At White House insistence , they said , the administration had ignored cases in which Russian officials appeared to be involved in such conventional arms transfers to Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries .
The administration finally barred three Russian companies from doing business with the United States for a year after they sold anti-tank weapons to Syria .
In the Kazakhstan affair , Tokayev said his government had received no money from North Korea and had requested that North Korea return the aircraft .
He said that Kazakhstan had received no formal response , but that North Korea 's envoy in Moscow had told a Kazakh diplomat there that his country had not received the planes .
Tokayev said repairing Kazakh - U.S. relations was a top priority .
`` The most important issue is to restore trust between the countries , '' Tokayev said .
`` We used to be very good partners .
Big damage has been brought to our cooperation .
I as foreign minister understand the seriousness of the situation .
We are ready to do our part . ''
