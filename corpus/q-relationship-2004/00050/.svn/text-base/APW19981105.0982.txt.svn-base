A jailed leader of the Cali drug cartel was shot and killed Thursday while watching a soccer game in a Colombian prison yard .
Helmer `` Pacho '' Herrera , 47 , was killed by a gunman dressed in a suit and tie inside Palmira prison in Cali , prison authorities said .
He was formerly the No. 3 of the cocaine cartel .
Herrera was seated in the stands at halftime of a national prison championship match when the gunman fired six times at point-blank range , said prison service chief Carmen Lucia Tristancho .
He died on the way to the hospital .
The assailant , grabbed and roughed up by prisoners and guards , entered the prison half an hour before identifying himself as a lawyer for another inmate , Tristancho said .
It was unclear whether the gunman , who identified himself as 32-year -old Rafael Angel Uribe , had smuggled the weapon into the penitentiary or whether the gun was already inside , she said .
Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996 and was convicted of drug trafficking earlier this year .
The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera in July 1996 , but Colombian law forbade his extradition .
In the 1980s , Herrera personally directed cocaine distribution and money laundering activities in the New York City area on behalf of the cartel , according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
Gaining a reputation as a deft money-launderer , Herrera had by 1990 established his own family-run cocaine trafficking business and set up and maintained cocaine distribution networks in Los Angeles , Houston and Miami , the DEA says .
Herrera is the second-leading member of the Cali cartel killed since 1995 , when police captured the organization 's top leaders , Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela .
Both are currently serving jail terms .
Jose Santacruz Londono , another top cartel boss , was killed by police in March 1996 .
