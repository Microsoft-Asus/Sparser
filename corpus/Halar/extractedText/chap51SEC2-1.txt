 What is behavior?

Most of what we call behavior consists of an animal's muscular activity that is externally visible. In some cases, it is the whole body that moves, as when a predator chases its prey. In other cases, the behavior is a movement of a body part, even though the animal stays in place, as when we signal a direction by extending our arm and pointing a finger. There are also examples of behavior in which muscular activity is less obvious, as when a bird sings by using muscles to force air from its lungs and shape the sounds in its throat. And there are even some nonmuscular activities that count as behavior, as when an animal secretes a sex attractant. Finally, we might include learning as a behavioral process, even when any observable behavior it produces occurs only later. For example, a young bird may memorize a song that it hears an adult of its species singing. But the first observable muscular activity based on this memory may not occur until months later, when the bird begins to sing the song for itself. Thus, in addition to studying observable behaviors, mainly in the form of muscle-powered activities, behavioral biologists also study the mechanisms underlying those behaviors, which may not involve muscles at all. Put another way, we can think of behavior as what an animal does and how it does it, a definition broad enough to include nonmotor components of behavior such as learning and memory.
