ANKARA , March 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkey Monday called on Iraq to implement the agreement it reached with the United Nations a week ago in a bid to completely defuse the crisis arising from weapons inspections .
Speaking at a weekly news briefing here , Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey hopes that this accord could put an end to the Iraqi - U.S. standoff .
`` We welcomed the agreement reached between the U.N. secretary general and the Iraqi government and we are hoping that Iraq will carry out all the provisions , '' Atacanli said .
When asked whether the Iraqi crisis is really over , Atacanli said that this has to depend on whether the Iraqi leadership will keep their promise .
`` As we have announced on many occasions , we do n't want to see any further dangerous developments of the situation in this region , '' he said .
Turkey had been actively involved in the international efforts of seeking a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis since the United States threatened to force Baghdad to back down with military strikes .
As a neighboring country of Iraq , Turkey does not want to see the situation in the sanctions-stricken country further deteriorating due to a military confrontation with Washington , analysts said .
Turkey has suffered huge economic losses since the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq , a major trading parter of Turkey , following the 1991 Gulf War , according to Turkey 's official statistics .
Turkish officials have expressed the hope that the U.N. sanctions against Iraq should be lifted as early as possible if Iraq has fully implemented relevant U.N. resolutions .
