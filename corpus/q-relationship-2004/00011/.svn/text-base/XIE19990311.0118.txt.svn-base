NAIROBI , March 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- - - The Democratic Republic of the Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- Thursday ordered the expulsion of six western diplomats and officials who it accuses of spying .
Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji told a news conference late Wednesday night that the six included a British diplomat whose expulsion had been announced earlier in the day , according to a report reaching here from Kinshasa , capital of the DRC .
The others are four British government officials and one from the United States , detained in Kinshasa since Sunday .
`` The government has decided to proceed with their immediate expulsion from national territory by the first plane leaving Kinshasa , '' Kakudji said .
`` These men violated the Vienna Convention by introducing themselves illegally into the grounds of the Ndolo Military Base , '' he said .
`` After an in-depth investigation , all the facts have been established .
These men were carrying sophisticated photography equipment , maps of the barracks and of strategic points in the city of Kinshasa and its environs , '' the minister added .
`` This illustrates sufficiently the bad intentions of these undesirable visitors with regards to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . ''
DRC , the former Zaire , has been engulfed by eight months of war as Kabila 's government forces and those of his allies Zimbabwe , Angola , Chad and Namibia fight Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda .
The rebels control much of the country 's eastern regions .
Earlier on Wednesday , Kakudji said the British diplomat who was detained on Sunday was the ring-leader of the six-strong group and had been ordered to leave the country at once .
Britain earlier criticised the expulsion of the diplomat , whom it named as Gregor Lusty , and denied charges that the detained men were spying .
