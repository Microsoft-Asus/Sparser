AMMAN , Jordan --
Inside King Hussein 's palace , time was running out .
Fever and exhaustion wracked his body .
It was late Monday night and the 63-year -old monarch 's doctors had just informed him that six months of cancer treatment in the United States had failed .
He 'd have to return immediately to Minnesota 's Mayo Clinic for emergency care , making it possible he 'd never return to the kingdom he ruled for nearly a half century .
So for five hours , until 1 a.m .
Tuesday , he struggled to compose a letter in longhand that would explain why he would not pass the crown to his 51-year -old brother , Prince Hassan , the expected heir for 34 years .
Then he appointed his oldest son as successor -- and shocked the nation with his flight to the United States , just 12 hours later .
Thrust into his new role , the 36-year -old Crown Prince Abdullah was already hearing from the world 's policy-makers Thursday , meeting US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about steadily mounting tensions in Iraq .
Thursday his father was listed in stable condition , but palace sources fear he does not have long to live .
The week 's stunning turn of events inside the palace sent shockwaves through the nation and the region , where Jordan is caught between Iraq and Israel .
It is a story of grand political significance in one of the Middle East 's most pivotal nations .
And it is a deeply personal tale of family dynamics and the struggle to reconcile the loss of a patriarch to cancer .
`` It is a tragedy , a kind of King Lear tragedy .
If I were a playwright , I would write it that way , '' said one former palace official who served as a close confidant to the king for eight years .
The essence of Hassan 's downfall is that , after waiting more than have his life to be king , he suddenly grasped too quickly for power .
The King interpreted his actions , and the actions of his wife , sources say , as an attempt to usurp power while he was fighting for his life at the Mayo clinic through six months of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants .
Some of Hassan 's actions went to the core of power .
Hassan tried to replace the army chief of staff , which infuriated the King .
And some were the more banal workings of a family .
Hassan 's wife , the Pakistan -born Princess Sarvath , began redecorating the palace to her tastes , which infuriated the American -born Queen Noor .
The King 's handwritten , 11-page letter to his brother and his subjects , published in the Jordan Times , scathingly rebuked Hassan for his actions .
In the official English translation , the king made reference to `` climbers , '' which sources say referred to Princess Sarvath and some of Hassan 's confidants .
But the Arabic version went further , using a word that translates as `` parasites . ''
The King also described remarks , presumably by Princess Sarvath , made about his wife and children as `` slanderous . ''
`` They were in a rush , '' one former ambassador for the palace said of Hassan and his wife .
The result : the learned , experienced , and loyal brother -- who Jordanians for more than three decades had expected to be their future king -- was suddenly cast aside .
`` It was a matter of misinterpretation of motives .
The younger brother saw -LRB- his actions , such as changes in the military -RRB- as a rational responsibility .
The sick man saw them as a conspiracy against him , '' one source explained .
Now the King 's relatively obscure son , a boyish looking military commander who loves sports and has little experience in international affairs , is ascendant .
It says a lot about Abdullah that even though he was the King 's oldest son by his second marriage , he was never considered a likely successor .
If anything , palace watchers believed that Hussein wanted to pass the crown to Prince Hamzah , the favorite son of Hussein and eldest son of Queen Noor , the King 's fourth and current wife .
But Hamzah is only 18 and now enrolled in Sandhurst , the British military academy where his father and brother Abdullah also attended .
`` The King was favoring Hamzah , '' said Ahmad Obeidat , a former prime minister and palace official who last month visited the King in the hospital .
`` Nobody even thought about Abdullah .
But the time element became very important . ...
The calculations changed very fast '' when the king received the news this week that his condition was detereorating rapidly .
Obeidat explained that immediately after the King 's homecoming last week , the king was still entertaining the idea that perhaps his health would hold out long enough for him to reorganize the monarchy .
Some sources believed Hussein was planning to make Prince Hassan a regent , or acting King , and make his son Hamzah Crown Prince so that when he came of age he would inherit the throne .
But this would have required a long campaign to change the nation 's constitution -- and parliamentary approval .
With the King 's sudden return to the Mayo Clinic , the option evaporated .
`` It 's simple .
The King wanted his son to be king , not his brother ...
When he realized it could not be Hamzah , he settled for Abdullah , '' said Obeidat .
`` This has left Queen Noor disappointed . ''
The former Lisa Halaby , a woman known worldwide for her beauty , grace and work in advocating a global ban on landmines , is suddenly facing an uncertain role in the Hashemite kingdom .
For Hassan , the king 's brother , the disappointment showed clearly on his face , even while he publicly embraced Abdullah and said he accepted the king 's decision .
`` You could tell he was in shock , '' said Obeidat , who visited the Crown Prince in the palace .
`` It 's not easy for a man after 34 years in a post to find himself out of it . ''
Abdullah , known as is his father for his common touch , inherits a Jordan with a stagnant economy , climbing unemployment and severely limited opportunities for its younger generation .
He will have to find a way to convince a nation that they should give the peace process with Israel more time , despite little economic return so far .
And he must closely watch the unpredictable regime of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq .
Some analysts in Jordan expressed concern that nations in the region , perhaps Iraq or Israel , might take advantage of the instability in Jordan to further their own interests .
Some analysts also question whether US officials may have played a behind-the-scenes role in the rapid change in succession to the throne .
None would dispute that Hussein and Hassan both value the long relationship and strong economic support provided by the United States to Jordan .
But Hassan was widely viewed as more skeptical than his brother of the 1994 Jordan - Israel peace plan .
He was more likely to be outspoken in demanding Israeli compliance with the terms of the pact , regarding both Jordan and Palestinian interests .
Hassan was also generally viewed as more `` lenient '' than the king on Iraq , as one former Jordanian minister put it , and more likely to speak out against the human suffering caused by eight years of crippling economic sanctions on Iraq .
In Thursday 's meeting , Albright was quick to back Abdullah with American aid and introduce him to Frank Ricciardone , the US official overseeing Washington 's pressure campaign against Iraq .
The two men chatted on the steps of the palace while Albright fielded questions Thursday afternoon .
Some question whether Washington did not prefer the younger Abdullah , a perhaps more impressionable ruler whose views could be shaped to fit the contours of US interests .
`` It is an important question , '' said Obeidat .
`` It will take a long time to find out the answer . ''
