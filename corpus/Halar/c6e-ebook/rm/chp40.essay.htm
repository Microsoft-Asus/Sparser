									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">The biologist C. Bergmann noted that mammals and birds occurring at higher latitudes are on average larger and bulkier than related species found at lower latitudes. This observation, sometimes called Bergmann’s Rule, has exceptions, but appears to hold true in most cases. Suggest an evolutionary hypothesis for this "rule" based on physical principles.</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">Medical researchers are investigating the possibilities of artificial substitutes for various human tissues. Examples are a liquid that could serve as "artificial blood" and a fabric that could temporarily serve as artificial skin for victims of serious burns. In what other situations might artificial blood or skin be useful? What characteristics would these substitutes need in order to function effectively in the body? Why do real tissues work better? Why not use the real things if they work better? Can you think of other artificial tissues that might be useful? What problems do you anticipate in developing and applying them?</p>
