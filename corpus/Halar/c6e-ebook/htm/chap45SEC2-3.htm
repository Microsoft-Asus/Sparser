For example, in Chapter 43 we described the roles of interleukins in immunity. In Chapters 11, 12, and 19 we introduced the local regulators called growth factors and their involvement in cancer.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Growth factors</span> are peptides and proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. They must be present in the extracellular environment for many types of cells to grow, divide, and develop normally. Because growth factors are generally named for the first function discovered for them, their names can be misleading, for a given growth factor can have several kinds of target cells and a variety of functions. For instance, nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein that speeds the development of certain embryonic nerve cells, also affects developing white blood cells and several other kinds of cells.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Growth factors have been studied mainly in cell cultures, but many experiments show that growth factors work within the animal body as well as in culture. For instance, injecting epidermal growth factor (EGF) into fetal mice accelerates epidermal development. And a group of peptides known as insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), produced by the liver, is essential to skeletal development. It is likely that the interaction of numerous growth factors regulates cell behavior in developing tissues and organs of animals. Ongoing research also suggests that growth factors (specifically, transforming growth factor, TGF) can enhance the strength of synapses between neurons in the brain of a mature animal.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Another important kind of local regulator is a gas, <span class="Emphasis2">nitric oxide (NO).</span> Many types of cells produce NO, and it has multiple functions. Highly reactive and potentially toxic, NO usually triggers changes in a target cell within a few seconds of contact and then breaks down. Secreted by neurons, NO functions as a neurotransmitter (see Chapter 48); secreted by white blood cells, it kills certain bacteria and cancer cells in body fluids. And NO released by endothelial cells in blood vessels makes the adjacent smooth muscles relax, dilating the vessel walls. American pharmacologists Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering work on the physiological effects of NO.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The local regulators called <span class="Emphasis2">prostaglandins (PGs)</span> are modified fatty acids, often derived from lipids to the plasma membrane. They are so named because they were first discovered in the components of semen produced by the human prostate gland. Prostaglandins in semen stimulate contraction of smooth muscles in the wall of the uterus, helping to convey sperm to the egg. Released from most types of cells into the interstitial fluid, prostaglandins function as local regulators affecting nearby cells in various ways. Some of the best-known actions of prostaglandins are on the female reproductive system. For example, prostaglandins secreted by cells of the placenta cause chemical changes in the nearby muscles of the uterus, making them more excitable and thereby helping to induce labor during childbirth. This is an example of a positive feedback mechanism coordinating a body function (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.19</span>).</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Prostaglandins also function as local regulators in vertebrate defense systems. Various prostaglandins help induce fever and inflammation and also intensify the sensation of pain (which can be thought of as contributing to the body’s defense by sounding an alarm that something harmful is going on). The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and ibuprofen result from the inhibitory effects of these drugs on prostaglandin synthesis.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Two prostaglandins with very similar molecular structures, prostaglandin E (PGE) and prostaglandin F (PGF), have opposite effects on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels serving the lungs. PGE causes the muscles to relax, which dilates the blood vessels and promotes oxygenation of the blood. PGF signals the muscles to contract, which constricts the vessels and reduces blood flow through the lungs. In other words, these two chemical signals are antagonistic. Shifts in their relative concentrations help maintain homeostasis in changing circumstances, making these local regulators another example of the use of antagonistic signals to counterbalance each other.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
