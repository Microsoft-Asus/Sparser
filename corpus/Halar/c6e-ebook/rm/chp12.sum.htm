DNA is partitioned among chromosomes, making it easier for the eukaryotic cell to replicate and distribute its huge amounts of DNA. Chromosomes consist of chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein that condenses during mitosis. When chromosomes replicate, they form identical sister chromatids. The chromatids separate during mitosis, becoming the chromosomes of the new daughter cells.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity12A:<span class="Emphasis1">

Between divisions, cells are in interphase: the G<SUB>1</SUB>, S, and G<SUB>2</SUB> phases. The cell grows throughout interphase, but DNA is replicated only during the S (synthesis) phase. Mitosis is a continuous process, often described as occurring in five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity12B:<span class="Emphasis1">

The spindle arises from the centrosomes, organelles near the nucleus that in animal cells include centrioles. Spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores of chromatids and move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate. In anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles of the cell. Using motor proteins, each kinetochore moves along shortening microtubules. Meanwhile, nonkinetochore microtubules from opposite poles slide past each other, elongating the cell. In telophase, daughter nuclei form at opposite ends of the cell.</p></LI><LI><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm: <span class="Emphasis1">a closer look</span> (pp. 221-222,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 12.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Mitosis is usually followed by cytokinesis, involving cleavage furrows in animals and cell plates in plants.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity12C:<span class="Emphasis1">
