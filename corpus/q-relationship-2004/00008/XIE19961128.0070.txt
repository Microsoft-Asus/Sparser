TOKYO , November 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department -LRB- MPD -RRB- will resign over the the suspected cover-up of an MPD officer 's confession to shooting Japan 's police chief in an assassination attempt .
The resignation of Yukihiko Inoue , Superintendent general of the MPD , will be officially announced after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashiomoto approves it , according to the National Public Safety Commission .
The commission is responsible for supervising the nation 's police force .
The commission said Inoue would be succeeded on , December 3 , by Kenji Maeda , director of the Secretariat of the National Police Agency -LRB- NPA -RRB- .
The commission , headed by Home Affairs Minister Katsuhiko Shirakawa , also took disciplinary action against five senior MPD officials for negligence .
The police sergeant who allegedly confessed in May to shooting Takaji Kunimatsu , commissioner general of the NPA , belonged to the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect .
But the MPD failed to start a thorough investigation to verify the confession for five months .
And the policeman 's story was revealed to only a few high ranking officials in the organization , with no report made to the NPA .
The confession was made public only after it was leaked to the press .
The shooting took place in March last year , 10 days after the sarin gas attack on Tokyo 's subway system that killed 11 people and injured more than 5,000 others .
The doomsday cult , accused of the subway attack , is also suspected of involvement in the shooting .
Kunimatsu was seriously injured but returned to duty after being hospitalized for months .
The resignation of Inoue is designed to impress the public with the NPA 's determination to resolve the Kunimatsu case in time for the opening of a Diet session Friday .
Last month , the NPA sacked Masaru Sakurai , head of the MPD public Safety Department and chief investigator of the shooting .
Inoue will be the first MPD chief to resign over mismanagement since 1978 when the then MPD superintendent general , Kuniyasu Tsuchida , stepped down following the murder of a female college student by a policeman in Tokyo .
