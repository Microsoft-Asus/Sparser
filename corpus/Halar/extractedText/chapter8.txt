The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its nonliving surroundings. A remarkable film only about 8 nm thick--it would take over 8,000 to equal the thickness of this page--the plasma membrane controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. One of the earliest episodes in the evolution of life may have been the formation of a membrane that enclosed a solution different from the surrounding solution while still permitting the uptake of nutrients and elimination of waste products. This ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane that makes this selectivity possible.

In this chapter, you will learn how cellular membranes control the passage of substances. We will concentrate on the plasma membrane, the outermost membrane of the cell, represented in the drawing on this page. However, the same general principles of membrane traffic also apply to the many varieties of internal membranes that partition the eukaryotic cell. To understand how membranes work, we begin by examining their architecture.

 Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition



Lipids and proteins are the staple ingredients of membranes, although carbohydrates are also important. The most abundant lipids in most membranes are phospholipids. Their ability to form membranes is built into their molecular structure. A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see FIGURE 5.12). Other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic. Furthermore, most of the proteins of membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.

How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes of cells? You encountered the currently accepted model for the arrangement of these molecules in Chapter 7 (see FIGURE 7.6). In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a fluid structure with various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. We'll discuss this model in detail, starting with the story of how it was developed.

The biological membrane is an exquisite example of a supramolecular structure--many molecules ordered into a higher level of organization--with emergent properties beyond those of the individual molecules. The remainder of this chapter focuses on one of the most important of those properties: the ability to regulate transport across cellular boundaries, a function essential to the cell's existence as an open system. We will see once again that form fits function: The fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cell's molecular traffic.





 Membrane models have evolved to fit new data

Scientists began building molecular models of the membrane decades before membranes were first seen with the electron microscope in the 1950s. In 1895, Charles Overton hypothesized that membranes are made of lipids, based on his observations that substances that dissolve in lipids enter cells much more rapidly than substances that are insoluble in lipids. Twenty years later, membranes isolated from red blood cells were chemically analyzed and found to be composed of lipids and proteins.

In 1917, Irving Langmuir made artificial membranes by adding phospholipids dissolved in benzene (an organic solvent) to water. After the benzene evaporated, the phospholipids remained as a film covering the surface of the water, with only the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids immersed in the water (FIGURE 8.1a). In 1925, two Dutch scientists, E. Gorter and F. Grendel, reasoned that cell membranes must actually be phospholipid bilayers, two molecules thick. Such a bilayer could exist as a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments because the molecular arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water (FIGURE 8.1b). Gorter and Grendel measured the phospholipid content of membranes isolated from red blood cells and found just enough of the lipid to cover the cells with two layers. (Ironically, Gorter and Grendel underestimated both the phospholipid content and the surface area of the cells, but the two errors canceled each other. Thus, what turned out to be a correct conclusion was based on flawed measurements.)

If we assume that a phospholipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane, where do we place the proteins? Although the heads of phospholipids are hydrophilic, the surface of an artificial membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer adheres less strongly to water than does the surface of an actual biological membrane. This difference could be accounted for if the membrane were coated on both sides with hydrophilic proteins. In 1935, Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed a sandwich model: a phospholipid bilayer between two layers of globular protein (FIGURE 8.2a).

Fig 8-2. Two generations of membrane models.

When researchers first used electron microscopes to study cells in the 1950s, the pictures seemed to support the Davson-Danielli model. In electron micrographs of cells stained with atoms of heavy metals, the plasma membrane is triple-layered, having two dark (stained) bands separated by an unstained layer (see FIGURE 7.6a). Most early electron microscopists assumed that the stain adhered to the proteins and hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids, leaving the hydrophobic core of the membrane unstained. By the 1960s, the Davson-Danielli sandwich had become widely accepted as the structure not only of the plasma membrane, but of all the internal membranes of the cell. However, by the end of that decade, many cell biologists recognized two problems with the model.

First, the generalization that all membranes of the cell are identical was challenged. Not all membranes look alike through the electron microscope. For example, whereas the plasma membrane is 7-8 nm thick and has the three-layered structure, the inner membrane of the mitochondrion is only 6 nm thick and in electron micrographs looks like a row of beads. Mitochondrial membranes also have a substantially greater percentage of proteins than plasma membranes, and there are differences in the specific kinds of phospholipids and other lipids. Membranes with different functions differ in chemical composition and structure. A second, more serious problem with the sandwich model is in the placement of the proteins. Unlike proteins dissolved in the cytosol, membrane proteins are not very soluble in water. Membrane proteins have hydrophobic regions as well as hydrophilic regions (that is, they are amphipathic). If such proteins were layered on the surface of the membrane, their hydrophobic parts would be in an aqueous environment.

In 1972, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson advocated a revised membrane model that placed the proteins in a location compatible with their amphipathic character. They proposed that membrane proteins are dispersed and individually inserted into the phospholipid bilayer, with only their hydrophilic regions protruding far enough from the bilayer to be exposed to water (FIGURE 8.2b). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. According to this model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids--hence the term fluid mosaic model.

A method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane (FIGURE 8.3). Freeze-fracture splits a membrane along the middle of the phospholipid bilayer. When the halves of the fractured membrane are viewed in the electron microscope, the interior of the bilayer appears cobblestoned, with protein particles interspersed in a smooth matrix, as in the fluid mosaic model. Other kinds of evidence further support this arrangement.

Fig 8-3. Freeze-fracture and freeze-etch. With this method, the two-layer plasma membrane (or other cell membrane) can be split into its two layers. When the separated layers are examined with an electron microscope, the ultrastructure of the membrane's interior is revealed.

Models are proposed by scientists as hypotheses, ways of organizing and explaining existing information. Replacing one model of membrane structure with another does not imply that the original model was worthless. The acceptance or rejection of a model depends on how well it fits observations and explains experimental results. A good model also makes predictions that shape future research. Models inspire experiments, and few models survive these tests without modification. New findings may make a model obsolete; even then, it may not be totally scrapped, but revised to incorporate the new observations. The fluid mosaic model is continually being refined and may one day undergo major revision.

Now let's take a closer look at membrane structure, beginning with the word fluid.





 Membranes are fluid

Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. A membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions, which are much weaker than covalent bonds (see Chapter 5). Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can drift about laterally--that is, in the plane of the membrane (FIGURE 8.4a). It is rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule would have to cross the hydrophobic core of the membrane.

Fig 8-4. The fluidity of membranes.

The lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid, averaging about 2 mm--the length of a typical bacterial cell--per second. Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly, but some membrane proteins do, in fact, drift (FIGURE 8.5). And some membrane proteins seem to move in a highly directed manner, perhaps driven along cytoskeletal fibers by motor proteins connected to the membrane proteins' cytoplasmic regions. However, many other membrane proteins seem to be held virtually immobile by their attachment to the cytoskeleton.

Fig 8-5. Evidence for the drifting of membrane proteins. When researchers fuse a human cell with a mouse cell, it takes less than an hour for the membrane proteins of the two species to completely intermingle in the membrane of the hybrid cell.

A membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases, until finally the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies, much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools. The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see FIGURES 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbons do not pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbons (see FIGURE 8.4b).

The steroid cholesterol, which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells, has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures (see FIGURE 8.4c). At relatively warm temperatures--at 37&#176;C, the body temperature of humans, for example--cholesterol makes the membrane less fluid by restraining the movement of phospholipids. However, because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids, it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify.

Membranes must be fluid to work properly; they are usually about as fluid as salad oil. When a membrane solidifies, its permeability changes, and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive. Cells can alter the lipid composition of their membranes as an adjustment to changing temperature. For instance, in many plants that tolerate extreme cold, such as winter wheat, the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn, an adaptation that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter.





 Membranes are mosaics of structure and function

Now we come to the word mosaic. A membrane is a collage of different proteins embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer (FIGURE 8.6). The lipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane, but proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions. The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each have unique collections of proteins. More than 50 kinds of proteins have been found so far in the plasma membrane of red blood cells, for example.

Notice in FIGURE 8.6 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins. Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Many are transmembrane proteins, which completely span the membrane. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids (see FIGURE 5.15), usually coiled into a helices (FIGURE 8.7). The hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to the exposed parts of integral proteins (see FIGURE 8.6).

Fig 8-7. The structure of a transmembrane protein. This ribbon model highlights the a-helical secondary structure of the hydrophobic parts of the protein, which lie mostly within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. This particular protein, bacteriorhodopsin, has seven transmembrane helices (outlined with cylinders for emphasis). The nonhelical hydrophilic segments of the protein are in contact with the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Bacteriorhodopsin is a specialized transport protein found in certain bacteria.

On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, some membrane proteins are held in place by attachment to the cytoskeleton. And on the exterior side, certain membrane proteins are attached to fibers of the extracellular matrix (see FIGURE 7.29; integrins are one particular type of integral protein). These attachments combine to give animal cells a stronger external framework than the plasma membrane itself could provide.

Membranes have distinct inside and outside faces. The two lipid layers may differ in specific lipid composition, and each protein has directional orientation in the membrane. The plasma membrane also has carbohydrates, which are restricted to the exterior surface. This asymmetrical distribution of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates is determined as the membrane is being built by the endoplasmic reticulum. Molecules that start out on the inside face of the ER end up on the outside face of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 8.8).

Fig 8-8. Sidedness of the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane has distinct cytoplasmic and extracellular sides, or faces. The extracellular face is topologically equivalent to the inside face of ER, Golgi, and vesicle membranes. Vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is responsible for enlarging the membrane and for secretion of cell products (purple). Carbohydrates on the extracellular surface (green) are synthesized in the ER and modified in the Golgi.

FIGURE 8.9 (p. 144) gives an overview of six major functions exhibited by proteins of the plasma membrane. A single cell may have membrane proteins performing several of these functions, and a single protein may have multiple functions. Thus, the membrane is a functional mosaic as well as a structural one.

 Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition

Cell-cell recognition, a cell's ability to distinguish one type of neighboring cell from another, is crucial to the functioning of an organism. It is important, for example, in the sorting of cells into tissues and organs in an animal embryo. It is also the basis for the rejection of foreign cells (including those of transplanted organs) by the immune system, an important line of defense in vertebrate animals (see Chapter 43). The way cells recognize other cells is by keying on surface molecules, often carbohydrates, on the plasma membrane.

Membrane carbohydrates are usually branched oligosaccharides with fewer than 15 sugar units. (Oligo is Greek for "few"; an oligosaccharide is a short polysaccharide.) Some of these oligosaccharides are covalently bonded to lipids, forming molecules called glycolipids. (Recall that glyco refers to the presence of carbohydrate.) Most, however, are covalently bonded to proteins, which are thereby glycoproteins (see FIGURE 8.6).

The oligosaccharides on the external side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell's surface enable oligosaccharides to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another. For example, the four human blood groups designated A, B, AB, and O reflect variation in the oligosaccharides on the surface of red blood cells.





 A membrane's molecular organization results in selective permeability

A steady traffic of small molecules and ions moves across the plasma membrane in both directions. Consider the chemical exchanges between a muscle cell and the extracellular fluid that bathes it. Sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients enter the cell, and metabolic waste products leave. The cell takes in oxygen for cellular respiration and expels carbon dioxide. It also regulates its concentrations of inorganic ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-, by shuttling them one way or the other across the plasma membrane. Although traffic through the membrane is extensive, cell membranes are selectively permeable, and substances do not cross the barrier indiscriminately. The cell is able to take up many varieties of small molecules and ions and exclude others. Moreover, substances that move through the membrane do so at different rates.

Permeability of the Lipid Bilayer

Hydrophobic molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, can dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it with ease. However, the hydrophobic core of the membrane impedes the transport of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic. Even water, a very small polar molecule, does not easily pass through a lipid bilayer, nor do glucose and other sugars, which are considerably larger. Similarly, a charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water also find the hydrophobic layer of the membrane difficult to penetrate. Fortunately, the lipid bilayer is only part of the story of a membrane's selective permeability. Proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport.

Transport Proteins

Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and polar molecules, including water. These hydrophilic substances avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane (see FIGURE 8.9, top). Some transport proteins function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane. Other transport proteins hold onto their passengers and physically move them across the membrane. In both cases, the transport protein is specific for the substances it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance or class of closely related substances to cross the membrane. For example, glucose carried in blood to the human liver enters liver cells rapidly through specific transport proteins in the plasma membrane. The protein is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose.

Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane. But what determines the direction of traffic across a membrane? At a given time, will a particular substance enter the cell or leave? And what mechanisms actually drive molecules across membranes? We will address these questions next as we explore two modes of membrane traffic: passive transport and active transport.





 Passive transport is diffusion across a membrane

Molecules have intrinsic kinetic energy called thermal motion (heat). One result of thermal motion is diffusion, the tendency for molecules of any substance to spread out into the available space. Each molecule moves randomly, yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional. For example, imagine a membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water. Assume that this membrane is permeable to the dye molecules (FIGURE 8.10a). Each dye molecule wanders randomly, but there will be a net movement of the dye molecules across the membrane to the side that began as pure water. The spreading of the dye across the membrane will continue until both solutions have equal concentrations of the dye. Once that point is reached, there will be a dynamic equilibrium, with as many dye molecules crossing the membrane in one direction as in the other each second.

Fig 8-10. The diffusion of solutes across membranes.

We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Put another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient. No work must be done to make this happen; diffusion is a spontaneous process because it decreases free energy (see FIGURE 6.5b). Recall that in any system there is a tendency for entropy, or disorder, to increase. Diffusion of a solute in water increases entropy by producing a more random mixture than exists when there are localized concentrations of the solute. It is important to note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient, unaffected by the concentration differences of other substances (FIGURE 8.10b).

Much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion. When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance). One important example is the uptake of oxygen by a cell performing cellular respiration. Dissolved oxygen diffuses into the cell across the plasma membrane. As long as cellular respiration consumes the O2 as it enters, diffusion into the cell will continue, because the concentration gradient favors movement in that direction.

The diffusion of a substance across a biological membrane is called passive transport because the cell does not have to expend energy to make it happen. The concentration gradient itself represents potential energy and drives diffusion. Remember, however, that membranes are selectively permeable and therefore affect the rates of diffusion of various molecules. Thanks to the widespread presence of the necessary transport protein, one molecule that diffuses freely across most membranes is water, a fact that has important consequences for cells.





 Osmosis is the passive transport of water

In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with a higher concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic. The solution with a lower solute concentration is hypotonic. (Hyper and hypo mean "more" and "less," respectively, referring here to solute concentration.) These are relative terms that are meaningful only in a comparative sense. For example, tap water is hypertonic to distilled water but hypotonic to seawater. In other words, tap water has a higher solute concentration than distilled water, but a lower concentration than seawater. Solutions of equal solute concentration are said to be isotonic (iso means "the same").

Picture a U-shaped vessel with a selectively permeable membrane separating two sugar solutions of different concentrations (FIGURE 8.11). Pores in this synthetic membrane are too small for sugar molecules to pass but large enough for water molecules to cross the membrane. In effect, the solution with higher solute concentration (hypertonic) has a lower water concentration. Therefore the water will diffuse across the membrane from the hypotonic solution to the hypertonic solution. This diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane is a special case of passive transport called osmosis.*

Fig 8-11. Osmosis. Two sugar solutions of different concentrations are separated by a porous membrane that is permeable to the solvent (water) but not to the solute (sugar). Water diffuses from the less concentrated (hypotonic) solution to the more concentrated (hypertonic) solution. This passive transport of water, or osmosis, reduces the difference in sugar concentrations.

The direction of osmosis is determined only by a difference in total solute concentration. Water moves from a hypotonic to a hypertonic solution even if the hypotonic solution has more kinds of solutes. Seawater, which has a great variety of solutes, will lose water to a very concentrated solution of a single sugar because the total solute concentration of the seawater is lower. If two solutions are isotonic, water moves across a membrane separating the solutions at an equal rate in both directions; that is, there is no net osmosis between isotonic solutions. (In Chapters 36 and 44, we will look at osmosis in a more quantitative way.)





 Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss

The movement of water across cell membranes and the balance of water between the cell and its environment are crucial to organisms. Let's now apply to living cells what we have learned about osmosis in artificial systems.

Water Balance of Cells Without Walls

If an animal cell is immersed in an environment that is isotonic to the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the plasma membrane. Water flows across the membrane, but at the same rate in both directions. In an isotonic environment, the volume of an animal cell is stable (FIGURE 8.12). Now let's transfer the cell to a solution that is hypertonic to the cell. The cell will lose water to its environment, shrivel, and probably die. This is one reason why an increase in the salinity (saltiness) of a lake can kill the animals there. However, taking up too much water can be just as hazardous to an animal cell as losing water. If we place the cell in a solution that is hypotonic to the cell, water will enter faster than it leaves, and the cell will swell and lyse (burst) like an overfilled water balloon.

Fig 8-12. The water balance of living cells. How living cells react to changes in the solute concentrations of their environments depends on whether or not they have cell walls. Animal cells do not have cell walls (top row); plant cells do (bottom row). (Arrows indicate net water movement when the cells are first placed in these solutions.)

A cell without rigid walls can tolerate neither excessive uptake nor excessive loss of water. This problem of water balance is automatically solved if such a cell lives in isotonic surroundings. Seawater is isotonic to many marine invertebrates. The cells of most terrestrial (land-dwelling) animals are bathed in an extracellular fluid that is isotonic to the cells. Animals and other organisms without rigid cell walls living in hypertonic or hypotonic environments must have special adaptations for osmoregulation, the control of water balance. For example, the protist Paramecium lives in pond water, which is hypotonic to the cell. Paramecium has a plasma membrane that is much less permeable to water than the membranes of most other cells, but this only slows the uptake of water, which continually enters the cell. Fortunately, Paramecium is also equipped with a contractile vacuole, an organelle that functions as a bilge pump to force water out of the cell as fast as it enters by osmosis (FIGURE 8.13). We will examine other evolutionary adaptations for osmoregulation in Chapter 44.

Fig 8-13. The contractile vacuole of Paramecium: an evolutionary adaptation for osmoregulation. The contractile vacuole of this freshwater protist offsets osmosis by bailing water out of the cell.

Water Balance of Cells with Walls

The cells of plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists have walls. When such a cell is in a hypotonic solution--when bathed by rainwater, for example--the wall helps maintain the cell's water balance. Consider a plant cell. Like an animal cell, the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis (see FIGURE 8.12). However, the elastic wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell that opposes further water uptake. At this point, the cell is turgid (very firm), which is the healthy state for most plant cells. Plants that are not woody, such as most house plants, depend for mechanical support on cells kept turgid by a surrounding hypotonic solution. If a plant's cells and their surroundings are isotonic, there is no net tendency for water to enter, and the cells become flaccid (limp), causing the plant to wilt.

On the other hand, a wall is of no advantage if the cell is immersed in a hypertonic environment. In this case, a plant cell, like an animal cell, will lose water to its surroundings and shrink. As the plant cell shrivels, its plasma membrane pulls away from the wall. This phenomenon, called plasmolysis, is usually lethal. The walled cells of bacteria and fungi also plasmolyze in hypertonic environments.





 Specific proteins facilitate the passive transport of water and selected solutes: a closer look

Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion.

A transport protein has many of the properties of an enzyme. Just as an enzyme is specific for its substrate, a transport protein is specialized for the solute it transports and may even have a specific binding site akin to the active site of an enzyme. Like enzymes, transport proteins can be saturated. There are only so many molecules of each type of transport protein built into the plasma membrane, and when these molecules are translocating passengers as fast as they can, transport is occurring at a maximum rate. Also like enzymes, transport proteins can be inhibited by molecules that resemble the normal "substrate." This occurs when the imposter competes with the normally transported solute by binding to the transport protein. Unlike enzymes, however, transport proteins do not usually catalyze chemical reactions. Their function is to catalyze a physical process--the transport of a molecule across a membrane that would otherwise be relatively impermeable to the substance.

Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Many transport proteins simply provide corridors allowing a specific molecule or ion to cross the membrane (FIGURE 8.14a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by such channel proteins allow water molecules or small ions to flow very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. In fact, it is water channel proteins, called aquaporins, that facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion illustrated in FIGURE 8.12. Some channel proteins function as gated channels; a stimulus causes them to open or close. The stimulus may be electrical or chemical; if chemical, it is a substance other than the one to be transported. For example, stimulation of a nerve cell by neurotransmitter molecules opens gated channels that allow sodium ions into the cell.

Fig 8-14. Two models for facilitated diffusion.

Not all transport proteins are channel proteins. Many transport proteins seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (FIGURE 8.14b). The changes in shape could be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule.

In certain inherited diseases, specific transport systems are either defective or missing altogether. An example is cystinuria, a human disease characterized by the absence of a protein that transports cystine and other amino acids across the membranes of kidney cells. Kidney cells normally reabsorb these amino acids from the urine and return them to the blood, but an individual afflicted with cystinuria develops painful stones from amino acids that accumulate and crystallize in the kidneys.





 Active transport is the pumping of solutes against their gradients

Despite the help of transport proteins, facilitated diffusion is still considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient. Facilitated diffusion speeds the transport of a solute by providing an efficient passage through the membrane, but it does not alter the direction of transport. Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients, across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated to the side where they are more concentrated. This transport is "uphill" and therefore requires work. To pump a molecule across a membrane against its gradient, the cell must expend its own metabolic energy; therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport.

Active transport is a major factor in the ability of a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small molecules that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared to its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions and a much lower concentration of sodium ions. The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell.

The work of active transport is performed by specific proteins embedded in membranes. As in other types of cellular work, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein. This may induce the protein to change its conformation in a manner that translocates a solute bound to the protein across the membrane. One transport system that works this way is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges sodium (Na+) for potassium (K+) across the plasma membrane of animal cells (FIGURE 8.15). FIGURE 8.16 (p. 150) reviews the distinction between passive transport and active transport.

Fig 8-15. The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients. The pump oscillates between two conformational states in a pumping cycle that translocates three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions pumped into the cell. ATP powers the changes in conformation by phosphorylating the transport protein (that is, by transferring a phosphate group to the protein).

 Some ion pumps generate voltage across membranes

All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy--a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasm of a cell is negative in charge compared to the extracellular fluid because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on opposite sides of the membrane. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -50 to -200 millivolts. (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative compared to the outside.)

The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared to the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient. In the case of ions, we must refine our concept of passive transport: An ion does not simply diffuse down its concentration gradient, but diffuses down its electrochemical gradient. For example, the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, gated channels that facilitate Na+ diffusion open. Sodium ions then "fall" down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and by the attraction of cations to the negative side of the membrane.

Some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Notice in FIGURE 8.15 that the pump does not translocate Na+ and K+ one for one, but actually pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell. With each crank of the pump, there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid, a process that stores energy in the form of voltage. A transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump. The sodium-potassium pump seems to be the major electrogenic pump of animal cells. The main electrogenic pump of plants, bacteria, and fungi is a proton pump, which actively transports hydrogen ions (protons) out of the cell. The pumping of H+ transfers positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular solution (FIGURE 8.17).

Fig 8-17. An electrogenic pump. Proton pumps, the main electrogenic pumps of plants, fungi, and bacteria, are membrane proteins that store energy by generating voltage (charge separation) across membranes. Using ATP for power, a proton pump translocates positive charge in the form of hydrogen ions. The voltage and H+ gradient represent a dual energy source that can drive other processes, such as the uptake of nutrients.

By generating voltage across membranes, electrogenic pumps store energy that can be tapped for cellular work, including a type of membrane traffic called cotransport.





 In cotransport, a membrane protein couples the transport of two solutes

A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it leaks back by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another specialized transport protein, separate from the pump, can couple the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of hydrogen ions generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One specific transport protein couples the return of hydrogen ions to the transport of sucrose into the cell (FIGURE 8.18). The protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The sucrose rides on the coattails of the hydrogen ion, which uses the common transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the concentration gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use the mechanism of sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into specialized cells in the veins of leaves. The sugar can then be distributed by the vascular tissue of the plant to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots.

Fig 8-18. Cotransport. An ATP-driven pump stores energy by concentrating a substance (here H+) on one side of the membrane. As the substance leaks back across the membrane through specific transport proteins, it escorts other substances (here sucrose) into the cell. In this case, the proton pump of the membrane is indirectly driving sucrose uptake by a plant cell with the help of a protein that cotransports the two solutes.





 Exocytosis and endocytosis transport large molecules

Water and small solutes enter and leave the cell by passing through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or by being pumped or carried across the membrane by transport proteins. Large molecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides, generally cross the membrane by a different mechanism involving vesicles. As we described in Chapter 7, the cell secretes macromolecules by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane; this is exocytosis. A transport vesicle that has budded from the Golgi apparatus moves along fibers of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. When the vesicle membrane and plasma membrane come into contact, the lipid molecules of the two bilayers rearrange themselves so that the two membranes fuse. The contents of the vesicle then spill to the outside of the cell (see FIGURE 8.8).

Many secretory cells use exocytosis to export their products. For example, certain cells in the pancreas manufacture the hormone insulin and secrete it into the blood by exocytosis. Another example is the neuron, or nerve cell, which uses exocytosis to release chemical signals that stimulate other neurons or muscle cells (see FIGURE 2.18). When plant cells are making walls, exocytosis delivers carbohydrates from Golgi vesicles to the outside of the cell.

In endocytosis, the cell takes in macromolecules and particulate matter by forming new vesicles from the plasma membrane. The steps are basically the reverse of exocytosis. A small area of the plasma membrane sinks inward to form a pocket. As the pocket deepens, it pinches in, forming a vesicle containing material that had been outside the cell.

There are three types of endocytosis: phagocytosis ("cellular eating"), pinocytosis ("cellular drinking"), and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In phagocytosis, a cell engulfs a particle by wrapping pseudopodia around it and packaging it within a membrane-enclosed sac large enough to be classified as a vacuole (FIGURE 8.19a, p. 152). The particle is digested after the vacuole fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes. In pinocytosis, the cell "gulps" droplets of extracellular fluid into tiny vesicles (FIGURE 8.19b). Because any and all solutes dissolved in the droplet are taken into the cell, pinocytosis is unspecific in the substances it transports. In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis is very specific (FIGURE 8.19c). Embedded in the membrane are proteins with specific receptor sites exposed to the extracellular fluid. The extracellular substances that bind to the receptors are called ligands, a general term for any molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site of another molecule (from the Latin ligare, to bind). The receptor proteins are usually clustered in regions of the membrane called coated pits, which are lined on their cytoplasmic side by a fuzzy layer of protein. These coat proteins probably help deepen the pit and form the vesicle. After the ingested material is liberated from the vesicle for metabolism, the receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis enables the cell to acquire bulk quantities of specific substances, even though those substances may not be very concentrated in the extracellular fluid. For example, human cells use the process to take in cholesterol for use in the synthesis of membranes and as a precursor for the synthesis of other steroids. Cholesterol travels in the blood in particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), complexes of lipids and proteins. These particles bind to LDL receptors on membranes and then enter the cells by endocytosis. In humans with familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disease characterized by a very high level of cholesterol in the blood, the LDL receptor proteins are defective, and the LDL particles cannot enter cells. Cholesterol accumulates in the blood, where it contributes to early atherosclerosis (the buildup of fat deposits on blood vessel linings).

Vesicles not only transport substances between the cell and its surroundings but also provide a mechanism for rejuvenating or remodeling the plasma membrane. Endocytosis and exocytosis occur continually to some extent in most eukaryotic cells, and yet the amount of plasma membrane in a nongrowing cell remains fairly constant over the long run. Apparently, the addition of membrane by one process offsets the loss of membrane by the other.

Energy and cellular work have figured prominently in our study of membranes. We have seen, for example, that active transport is powered by ATP. In the next two chapters, you will learn more about how cells acquire chemical energy to do the work of life. We'll call membranes back for an encore in these chapters, as they play a major role in how mitochondria and chloroplasts make energy available to cells.
