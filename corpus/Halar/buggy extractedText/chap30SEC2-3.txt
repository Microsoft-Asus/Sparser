 Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization

We have seen the relationship of the megasporangium to the ovule and the seed, but what goes on in a microsporangium of a seed plant? Microspores develop into pollen grains, which mature to become the male gametophytes of seed plants. The pollen grains, protected by tough sporopollenin-containing coats (see p. 580), can be carried away by wind or animals after their release from the microsporangium.

The transfer of pollen to ovules is called pollination. If a pollen grain lands in the vicinity of an ovule, it will elongate a tube that discharges one or more sperm into the female gametophyte within the ovule (see FIGURE 30.2b). In some gymnosperms, the sperm cells retain the ancestral flagellated condition. But in the most common gymnosperms (the conifers) and in all angiosperms (flowering plants), the sperm lack flagella.

This mechanism for transfer of sperm contrasts sharply with what we observed in seedless plants. Recall that in bryophytes and pteridophytes such as ferns, flagellated sperm released from antheridia must swim through a film of water to reach egg cells in archegonia. The distance for this sperm transport rarely exceeds a few centimeters. In seed plants, the use of resistant, far-traveling, airborne pollen to bring gametes together is a terrestrial adaptation that led to even greater success and diversity of plants on land.
