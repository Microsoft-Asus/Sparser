The decision follows this week 's duty-free importation into Indonesia of a consignment of automobiles from South Korea , which were believed to have been assembled with Indonesian parts .
`` The EU is concerned at the discrimination against European and other foreign vehicles in favor of national vehicles , '' an EU statement said .
`` It is something of a paradox that with import tariffs as high as 125 percent , the Indonesian government still feels that it needs discriminatory measures to protect its industry , '' EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said .
The measures adopted by Indonesia breached the basic principles of the multilateral trading system , he added .
