 Fungi and animals evolved from a common protistan ancestor

Animals probably evolved from aquatic flagellated organisms too, and there is compelling evidence that animals and fungi diverged from a common protistan ancestor. Comparisons of several proteins and ribosomal RNA indicate that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants (see FIGURE 28.8). We discuss animal phylogeny in more detail in Chapter 32.
