COLOMBO , October 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Sri Lanka 's Tamil rebel organization , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- , is to be banned soon by the Sri Lankan government , according to informed sources here today .
The proscription which will be gazetted under Emergency Regulations will identify the LTTE as a terrorist organization .
The sources pointed out that maintaining membership in the organization , supporting it , appearing on behalf of it or withholding information about it will be offenses punishable by law .
The United States of America has reportedly classified the LTTE as being among eight of the world 's most heinous , inhuman , wicked and disgusting terrorist organizations .
The LTTE , an armed Tamil group against the government , has been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a separate state in the north and east of the country .
More than 55,000 people have reportedly been killed in the civil war .

The proscription of the LTTE is expected to add clout to Sri Lanka 's appeal to Western countries to prevent the LTTE from fund raising , close down its offices and deport its members from those countries , the sources added .
