WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russians clearly want a more ordered society , and the United States is watching closely to see how former KGB officer Vladimir Putin tries to bring it about as president , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday .
`` The question is whether it 's order with a small or a capital ` O , ' '' she said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' from Geneva , where President Clinton met with Syria 's leader .
`` None of us would like to see order with a capital ` O. ' But one can understand why the Russians , after a certain chaotic period , would like to see some greater order in their lives , '' Albright said .
Appearing on CNN 's `` Late Edition , '' she added : `` We have to obviously watch his actions . ''
In elections Sunday , the 47-year -old Putin , the acting president , was winning 52.4 percent of the vote with 93 percent of the returns counted , apparently enough to give him an outright victory despite a stronger-than-expected showing by Russia 's revived Communist Party that threatened to push him into an April 16 runoff .
Either way , Putin 's eventual victory was considered almost certain .
Alluding to Putin 's ties to the former Soviet secret police , Albright said others `` have to stop the psychobabble '' about the Russian leader .
But she made clear that the Clinton administration is wary of just how far he would go toward strong-arming Russia 's disordered post-communist society into submission .
A big reason is the brutally suppressed rebellion in the Caucasus region Chechnya .
Many analysts say Putin 's tactics there helped drive his election success .
`` We 've made quite clear to him that the Russian way of proceeding -LRB- in Chechnya -RRB- is of great concern to us , '' Albright said on CBS .
But she said Putin `` has in many of his conversations with us indicated that there are lots of things to work with him on '' such as economic reform and arms control .
Albright said she is not ready to make a judgment about his commitment to democracy .
`` Certainly he uses all the right vocabulary when he talks about needing the vote of the people .
And it is historic that the Russians are having such an election , transfer of power in a constitutional and democratic way , '' she said on CNN .
`` His words are OK , but we have to watch his actions . ''
Members of Congress expressed similar uncertainty about Russia 's prospects under Putin .
Rep. Christopher Cox , R - Calif. , chairman of Speaker Dennis Hastert 's special advisory group on Russia , was in Moscow to monitor the voting .
Putin `` is said to be a law-and-order candidate .
That 's an interesting selection of words , '' Cox said on CNN .
`` Will it be law supporting order , or just the order part ? ''
Americans must remember , Cox said , that `` the United States has to take things as we find them , not as we want them to be . ''
`` He 's an enigma , '' Sen. Trent Lott , the Senate majority leader , said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''
`` He seems to be moving toward ... opening up and some reforms , and yet there is a throwback quality that 's got to worry us . ''
Lott , R - Miss. , said `` some of the tactics sound to me like old KGB tactics , '' especially Putin 's apparent manipulation of Russian news media .
`` But he 's young , '' Lott said .
`` He may be a very pleasant surprise . ''
