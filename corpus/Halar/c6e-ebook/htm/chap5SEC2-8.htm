The figure at the right shows the general formula for an amino acid. At the center of the amino acid is an asymmetric carbon atom called the <span class="Emphasis1">alpha (<span class="symbol">a</span>) carbon.</span> Its four different partners are an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group symbolized by R. The R group, also called the side chain, differs with the amino acid. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.15</span> shows the 20 amino acids that cells use to build their thousands of proteins. Here the amino and carboxyl groups are all depicted in ionized form, as they usually exist at the neutral pH inside a cell. The R group may be as simple as a hydrogen atom, as in the amino acid glycine (the one amino acid lacking an asymmetric carbon, since two of its <span class="symbol">a</span> carbon’s partners are hydrogen atoms), or it may be a carbon skeleton with various functional groups attached, as in glutamine. (Organisms have some other amino acids, not shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.15</span>, but these are not incorporated into proteins.)<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../img/ufg/UNFIG5-3.jpg" border="0" alt="" name="myUNFIG5-3.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1"></td></tr></table></p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-15a','../fig/big/fig5-15a.jpg','fig5-15a');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-15a.jpg" alt="fig5-15a" name="myfig5-15a"></a><br>a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-15b','../fig/big/fig5-15b.jpg','fig5-15b');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-15b.jpg" alt="fig5-15b" name="myfig5-15b"></a><br>b.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 5-15.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The 20 amino acids of proteins.</span> The amino acids are grouped here according to the properties of their side chains (R groups), highlighted in white.

In <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.15</span>, the amino acids are grouped according to the properties of their side chains. One group consists of amino acids with nonpolar side chains, which are hydrophobic. Another group consists of amino acids with polar side chains, which are hydrophilic. Acidic amino acids are those with side chains that are generally negative in charge owing to the presence of a carboxyl group, which is usually dissociated (ionized) at cellular pH. Basic amino acids have amino groups in their side chains that are generally positive in charge. (Notice that <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> amino acids have carboxyl groups and amino groups; the terms <span class="Emphasis1">acidic</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">basic</span> in this context refer only to the side chains.) Because they are charged, acidic and basic side chains are also hydrophilic.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Now that we have examined amino acids, let’s see how they are linked to form polymers (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.16</span>). When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other, an enzyme can cause them to join by catalyzing a dehydration reaction. The resulting covalent bond is called a <span class="Emphasis2">peptide bond.</span> Repeated over and over, this process yields a polypeptide, a polymer of many amino acids linked by peptide bonds (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.16</span>). At one end of the polypeptide chain is a free amino group, and at the opposite end is a free carboxyl group. Thus, the chain has an amino end (N-terminus) and a carboxyl end (C-terminus). The repeating sequence of atoms highlighted in purple in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.16b</span> is called the polypeptide backbone. Attached to this backbone are different kinds of appendages, the side chains of the amino acids. Polypeptides range in length from a few monomers to a thousand or more. Each specific polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids. The immense variety of polypeptides in nature illustrates an important concept introduced earlier--that cells can make many different polymers by linking a limited set of monomers into diverse sequences.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-16','../fig/big/fig5-16.jpg','fig5-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-16.jpg" alt="fig5-16" name="myfig5-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 5-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Making a polypeptide chain.
