SYSTEMATICS: CONNECTING CLASSIFICATION TO PHYLOGENY

 

 Taxonomy employs a hierarchical system of classification



 

 Modern phylogenetic systematics is based on cladistic analysis



 

 Systematists can infer phylogeny from molecular data



 

 The principle of parsimony helps systematists reconstruct phylogeny



 

 Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses



 

 Molecular clocks may keep track of evolutionary time



 

 Modern systematics is flourishing with lively debate



So far in this chapter, we have explored phylogeny, or evolutionary history, in light of the fossil record and geologic time, but biologists also use molecular data, comparative anatomy, and other approaches to trace phylogeny. And tracing phylogeny is one of the main goals of systematics, the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Systematics includes taxonomy, which is the naming and classification of species and groups of species. Formal taxonomy began in the 18th century with Linnaeus's book Systema naturae, which translates as "System of Nature," meaning a classification of all known natural life. A century later, Darwin both anticipated the future direction of taxonomy and introduced the new science of systematics when he wrote in The Origin of Species that "our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies." In this section, we examine the connection between phylogeny and classification that is at the center of modern systematics.
