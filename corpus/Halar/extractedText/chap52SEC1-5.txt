HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH

 

 The human population has been growing almost exponentially for three centuries but cannot do so indefinitely



 

 Estimating Earth's carrying capacity for humans is a complex problem



Humans are not exempt from natural processes. No population, including the human population, can grow indefinitely. In this last section of the chapter, we'll apply what we've learned about population dynamics to the specific case of the human population.

The explosive growth of the human population, coupled with massive consumption of the planet's resources by developed nations, is the primary cause of severe environmental degradation and the loss of biological species. Many of the environmental problems that we now confront cannot be solved without thoughtful regulation of our numbers. Population regulation in humans is a controversial issue, and we need to understand clearly the biological basis of our current problems before we can search for solutions.
