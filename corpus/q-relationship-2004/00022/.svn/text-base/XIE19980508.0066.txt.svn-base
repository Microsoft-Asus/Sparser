LAGOS , May 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Tens of thousands of refugees from eastern Sierra Leone 's diamond-rich Kono district have fled to neighboring Guinea , bringing new problems to the host and international aid agencies .
The people ran to escape persecution by remnants of the junta forces and rebels allies that are fighting against the mopping up exercise launched by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG weeks ago .
But the huge number of refugees entering into Guinea has aroused concern from both the Guinean government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- .
The State Radio in the Guinean capital Conakry Thursday quoted UNHCR as saying that a total of 148,000 Sierra Leonean refugees had entered the country from Kono and been registered by UNHCR .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Guinea has already ordered the setting up of a number of refugee camps at the border area some 700 km from Conakry</ENAMEX> , according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Expressing great concern about the accommondation of the refugees , since the largest refugee camps could hold only 12,000 refugees , the Guinean interior minister has called on UNHCR for immediate help</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">He also urged local communities to give a helping hand to the fleeing Sierra Leoneans</ENAMEX> .
According to the report , Sierra Leonean refugees have recently arrived in Guinea at some 4,000 a day .
The report quoted UNHCR officials as saying that all the refugees received Wednesday looked in bad shape and hungry .
A number of people , including children , are now said to be living in the bush and feeding on wild fruits to keep alive .
