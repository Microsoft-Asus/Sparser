Perhaps the most striking population cycles known are the 10-year cycles of snowshoe hares and lynx in the far northern forests of Canada and Alaska. Lynx are specialist predators of snowshoe hares, so it is not surprising that lynx numbers rise and fall with the numbers of hares (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.19</span>). But why do hare numbers rise and fall in 10-year cycles? There are three main hypotheses. First, cycles may be caused by food shortage during winter. Hares eat the terminal twigs of small shrubs such as willow and birch in winter and may suffer from malnutrition due to overgrazing. Second, cycles may be due to predator-prey interactions. Many predators other than lynx, such as coyotes, foxes, and great-horned owls, eat hares, and they might overexploit their prey. Third, cycles could be affected by a combination of food resource limitation and excessive predation.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig52-19a','../fig/big/fig52-19a.jpg','fig52-19a');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig52-19a.jpg" alt="fig52-19a" name="myfig52-19a"></a><br>a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig52-19b','../fig/big/fig52-19b.jpg','fig52-19b');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig52-19b.jpg" alt="fig52-19b" name="myfig52-19b"></a><br>b.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 52-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Population cycles in the snowshoe hare and lynx.</span> Population counts are based on the number of pelts sold by trappers to the Hudson Bay Company. The cycles of lynx populations are probably caused by cyclic fluctuations of the hare, a major food source for lynx. What causes the cycling of the prey population is a challenging research problem. Most patterns of population dynamics are likely caused by multiple interacting factors that are difficult to untangle without direct experimentation.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">If hare cycles are due to winter food shortage, then they should stop if extra food is added to a field population. Researchers have conducted such experiments for 20 years, over two hare cycles, in the Yukon and report two results. First, hare populations in the areas with extra food increased about threefold in density. The carrying capacity of a habitat for hares can clearly be increased by adding food. Second, the hares with extra food continued to cycle in the same way as the unfed control populations. In particular, cyclic collapses in density occurred in both experimental and control areas, and the decline in numbers could not be stopped by adding food. Thus, food supplies by themselves are not the cause of the hare cycle shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.19</span>, so we can discard the first hypothesis.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">By putting radio collars on hares, researchers can find individual hares as soon as they die, allowing field ecologists to de termine the immediate cause of death. Almost 90%  of the hares that died were killed by predators; none appeared to die of starvation. These data support either the second or third hypothesis. By excluding predators from one area with electric fences and by both excluding predators and adding food to another area, ecologists could test which of the remaining two hypotheses is the best explanation for the hare cycle. The results supported the hypothesis that the hare cycle is largely driven by excessive predation but with important impacts from the food supplies available, particularly in winter. Perhaps better-fed hares are more likely to escape from predators. Many different predators contribute to these losses; the cycle is not simply a hare-lynx cycle.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Some small herbivorous mammals, such as voles and lemmings, tend to have 3- to 4-year cycles, and some birds, such as the ruffed grouse and ptarmigan, have 9- to 11-year cycles. The causes of these cycles undoubtedly vary among species, and perhaps even among populations of the same species. Can we find common patterns in all these cycles? Several ideas have been suggested to explain cycles, but two are now prominent.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">One idea is that stress resulting from a high population density may alter hormonal balance, which in turn could reduce fertility and increase aggressiveness. Stress could also be produced by unsuccessful predator attacks or from having to search longer for high-quality food or from parasites that become more common at high population density. However, there are few measurements of stress levels in natural populations, and little is known about how stress affects behavior. Crowding and stress could be a common component in many species of animals that have population cycles, but we do not yet know if it is a major cause of cycles.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Population cycles also result from a time lag in the response of predators to rising prey numbers. Predators reproduce more slowly than their prey, so they always lag behind prey population growth. Some predators, such as birds of prey, can move over large areas and respond very quickly to patches of prey abundance in the environment, eliminating the usual time lag. In other cases, such as the preying on voles and lemmings by weasels, the predators cannot move about as easily and typically show a time lag in their response to prey numbers. Such a time-lag mechanism is a probable factor in the cyclic declines in voles and lemmings, as it is in snowshoe hares.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">For the lynx, great-horned owls, weasels, and other predators that depend heavily on a single prey species, the availability of prey is the major factor influencing their population changes. When prey become scarce, predators often turn on one another as well. Coyotes kill foxes and lynx, and great-horned owls kill smaller birds of prey as well as weasels, accelerating the collapse of the predator populations once prey numbers have collapsed in these cyclic systems.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">Long-term experimental studies are the key to unraveling the complex causes of population cycles.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
