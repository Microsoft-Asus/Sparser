WASHINGTON --
When President Clinton meets with his counterparts from 20 other Asia - Pacific powers on Sunday in New Zealand , the leaders will doubtless try to cast their gaze to the future .
First , though , they must deal with some troubling history .
In three parts of Asia the enduring legacy of five decades of simmering conflict -- between China and Taiwan ; Pakistan and India ; and North and South Korea -- continue to pose the threat of war .
In a fourth -- Indonesia 's East Timor -- a quarter-century of strife has erupted in a week of bloodshed and destruction that has left hundreds dead and forced up to 200,000 others to flee their homes .
Leaders will use the summit -- the annual meeting of the leaders of the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , or APEC -- to spotlight the patchy turnabout in the economies of nations that together will do more than $ 1 trillion in two-way trade with the United States this year , roughly 40 percent of the country 's total .
This year 's agenda , however , has been hijacked by security concerns roiling a region where the United States has fought three wars in this century alone and still maintains nearly 100,000 military forces .
`` Lasting economic recovery in Asia depends on more than open markets .
It will also require continued stability in the region , which can never be taken for granted , '' said Clinton 's National Security Adviser , Samuel Berger .
`` This is where the United States plays an especially vital role , and it will be an important part of our agenda at APEC . ''
The crisis in East Timor appears certain to dominate the two-day leaders ' summit , Sunday and Monday in Auckland , New Zealand .
Like other regional conflicts , the troubles in East Timor stem from unfinished business with deep roots in the past .
The island of Timor , in the eastern half of the 3,000-mile-long archipelago that makes up Indonesia , was once divided between Dutch and Portuguese colonists .
The Netherlands ceded West Timor , the Dutch -controlled portion , to Indonesia in 1950 .
Twenty -five years later , Indonesia invaded East Timor , evicting the Portuguese in an annexation never recognized by the United Nations .
Indonesia 's military has ruled East Timor with an iron fist , drawing two decades of criticism from the United States and standing as a formidable obstacle to U.S. - Indonesian relations .
On August 30 , under U.N. auspices , East Timor 's 900,000 residents voted overwhelmingly -LRB- 78.5 percent -RRB- in favor of independence .
When U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan announced the results last weekend , militia groups , police and thugs loyal to the government in Jakarta took to the streets armed with assault rifles , machetes and clubs on a murderous rampage targeting anyone suspected of backing independence .
In violation of its commitment to maintain order , Indonesia 's military has largely stood by and watched as hundreds have been killed and hundreds more wounded in an orgy of horror , bloodshed and destruction .
`` Obviously , right now the Indonesian military has not done what it said it would do and has failed in certain cases , if not participated in some of the violence , '' State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said Wednesday .
`` Indonesia 's relations with the international community , including the United States , are at risk here . ''
With the government of Indonesian President B.J. Habibie unable , or unwilling , to halt the terror , APEC 's members are split over whether to send in a U.N. peacekeeping force to restore order .
Without Jakarta 's approval -- so far , denied -- it would take a U.N. Security Council resolution , a measure no one was anticipating as of last week , to deploy such a force .
`` It 's a very , very tough choice in front of the international community , and it 's not just a question of sending in the Blue Helmets , '' as U.N. peacekeepers are called , said Indonesian scholar James Clad , who teaches Southeast Asian studies at Georgetown University in Washington .
`` It 's very hard to see how they would be able to win the agreement of all the elements of the Indonesian government , get in there and not be seen as taking sides , '' Clad said in a telephone interview from Indonesia , where he 's been monitoring developments .
`` It is very grim . ''
The Clinton administration was still shaping its views on the issue as the president boarded Air Force One late Thursday for the long trans- Pacific flight .
In the wake of the U.S. -led NATO air campaign over the Yugoslav province of Kosovo , the administration appeared prepared to see another country -- Australia has volunteered -- take the lead in any U.N. operation in East Timor .
With huge economic and strategic stakes across Asia , however , the United States is expected to play some role in trying to arrest the anarchy in East Timor , much as it has a hand in efforts to manage other hotspots across one of the world 's most volatile regions .
It 's not clear what , if anything , Clinton and his APEC partners might do to allay regional security concerns , apart from demonstrating that they are paying attention .
That 's preferable , though , to simply ignoring festering situations and allowing risks to escalate unattended , said international affairs analyst Stephen Cohen .
A senior fellow in the foreign studies program at the Washington -based Brookings Institution , Cohen faults the international community for not building a framework for Mideast -style peace talks aimed at finding a resolution to the Indian - Pakistani dispute over Kashmir .
It will take , at best , years to find a solution , said Cohen , but the international community could help nudge a peace process forward with a combination of incentives and sanctions .
`` There are about 10 solutions , '' said Cohen .
`` But a solution that everybody can agree on is impossible to find at the moment . ''
The parties themselves , moreover , are at odds over how to proceed .
Dwarfed by its giant neighbor , Pakistan is combing the Muslim world -- including Indonesia , the home to the largest Islamic population on Earth -- for diplomatic support on the issue .
India , for its part , wants no outside mediators fouling the current balance of power .
That equation is tilted heavily in favor of India , home to the world 's third-largest army , with 1.1 million men in arms , and the fourth largest air force , with 600 warplanes and nearly as many transport craft and helicopters .
Neither India nor Pakistan is an APEC member , but Cohen said it 's likely the forum will issue some sort of statement calling on the two countries to rely on dialogue to try to resolve the dispute over time .
A statement is also expected -- perhaps issued jointly by Clinton , South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi following their trilateral meeting schedule for Sunday -- appealing to North Korea for restraint and cooperation in exchange for increased diplomatic contacts and assistance from the industrialized world .
North Korea has taken a series of steps the South has regarded as provocative over the past year .
Pyongyang fired a multi-stage missile over Japan a year ago ; engaged in a naval shoot-out with South Korean ships in June ; has threatened to test a new long-range rocket that could reach the western United States ; and has announced that it would no longer honor the dividing line between its territorial waters and those of the South .
At the same time , though , North Korea is escalating its contacts with the United States and South Korea , as evidenced by meetings with U.S. diplomats in Berlin earlier this month .
`` It does seem as if the North is continuing to be interested in some kind of improvement -LRB- in relations -RRB- with the South , '' said Korean analyst Stephen Costello , president of ProGlobal Inc. , a Washington consulting firm .
`` The South , Japan and the United States want to take this momentum and see what they can do with it . ''
Clinton was scheduled to use a Saturday meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to try to build momentum in Sino - American relations , sorely tested this year by trade quarrels and war in the Balkans .
Beijing opposed NATO 's Balkans campaign even before U.S. bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last spring .
That debacle , blamed by an apologetic Pentagon on faulty intelligence , plumbed the lowest mark in U.S. - China relations since the Tiananmen Square massacre a decade ago .
Ties were further frayed in July , when Taiwan 's president , Lee Teng Hui , insisted during an press interview that Taiwan be accorded `` special state to state relations , '' with China .
Beijing bristled at the suggestion that Taiwan -- which China regards as an outlaw province -- should be accorded equal standing with China during talks over Taiwan 's future .
`` This is something that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot accept , '' Jiang told reporters this month during a trip to Australia .
The casual observer might wonder why all the fuss .
To China , though , Lee 's words represented not simply an unacceptable escalation in independence rhetoric , but a marked shift in attitude in Taipei .
With Taiwan slated to hold presidential elections next March -- only the second such vote in the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people , Beijing is looking to nip any change in tone in the bud .
`` What has changed is that Taiwan has finally gone out of its way to make the point that it is a sovereign , independent state and is going out of its way to publicize that fact , '' said former U.S. diplomat John Tkacik Jr. , president of China Business Intelligence , an Arlington , Va. -based consulting firm .
`` In the past , '' he said , `` it has played it down out of fear of offending Beijing . ''
