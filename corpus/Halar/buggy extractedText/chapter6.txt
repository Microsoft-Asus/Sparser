The living cell is a chemical industry in miniature, where thousands of reactions occur within a microscopic space. Sugars are converted to amino acids, and vice versa. Small molecules are assembled into polymers, which may be hydrolyzed later as the needs of the cell change. In plants and animals, many cells export chemical products that are used in other parts of the organism. The process known as cellular respiration drives the cellular economy by extracting the energy stored in sugars and other fuels. Cells apply this energy to perform various types of work, such as the synthesis of the macromolecules featured in Chapter 5. In a more exotic example, cells of the fungus in the photo above convert the energy stored in certain organic molecules to light, a process called bioluminescence. (The glow may attract insects that benefit the fungus by dispersing its spores.) Bioluminescence and all other metabolic activities carried out by a cell are precisely coordinated and controlled. In its complexity, its efficiency, its integration, and its responsiveness to subtle changes, the cell is peerless as a chemical institution. The concepts of metabolism you learn in this chapter will help you further understand the connections between chemistry and life.

The totality of an organism's chemical reactions is called metabolism (from the Greek metabole, change). Metabolism is an emergent property of life that arises from interactions between molecules within the orderly environment of the cell.

 A cell's physical and chemical environment affects enzyme activity



The laws of thermodynamics tell us what can and cannot happen under given conditions but say nothing about the speed of these processes. A spontaneous chemical reaction may occur so slowly that it is imperceptible. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose (FIGURE 6.11) is exergonic, occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy (DG = - 7 kcal/mol). Yet a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis. But if we add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase to the solution, then all the sucrose may be hydrolyzed within seconds. How does an enzyme do this?

 The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review



Chemical chaos would result if all of a cell's metabolic pathways were open simultaneously. Imagine, for example, a substance synthesized by one pathway and immediately broken down by another. The cell would be spinning its metabolic wheels. Actually, a cell tightly regulates its metabolic pathways by controlling when and where its various enzymes are active. It does this either by switching on and off the genes that encode specific enzymes (as we will discuss in Unit Three) or, as we discuss here, by regulating the activity of enzymes once they are made.





 The chemistry of life is organized into metabolic pathways

We can think of a cell's metabolism as an elaborate road map of the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in that cell (FIGURE 6.1, p. 88). These reactions are arranged in intricately branched metabolic pathways that alter molecules by a series of steps. Enzymes route matter through the metabolic pathways by selectively accelerating each step. Analogous to the red, yellow, and green lights that control the flow of traffic and prevent snarls, mechanisms that regulate enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand, averting deficits and surpluses of chemicals.

Fig 6-1. The complexity of metabolism. This diagram traces only a few hundred of the thousands of metabolic reactions that occur in a cell. The dots represent molecules, and the lines represent the chemical reactions that transform them. The reactions proceed in stepwise sequences called metabolic pathways, in which each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. The inset shows the first two steps in the catabolic pathway that breaks down glucose. (You'll learn more about this pathway in Chapter 9.)

As a whole, metabolism is concerned with managing the material and energy resources of the cell. Some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds. These degradative processes are called catabolic pathways. A major thoroughfare of catabolism is cellular respiration, in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down to carbon dioxide and water. Energy that was stored in the organic molecules becomes available to do the work of the cell. Anabolic pathways, in contrast, consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones. An example of anabolism is the synthesis of a protein from amino acids. Catabolic and anabolic pathways are the downhill and uphill avenues of the metabolic map. The metabolic pathways intersect in such a way that energy released from the "downhill" reactions of catabolism can be used to drive the "uphill" reactions of the anabolic pathways. This transfer of energy from catabolism to anabolism is called energy coupling.

In this chapter, we will focus on the mechanisms common to metabolic pathways. Because energy is fundamental to all metabolic processes, a basic knowledge of energy is necessary to understand how the living cell works. Although we will use some nonliving examples to study energy, keep in mind that the concepts demonstrated by these examples also apply to bioenergetics, the study of how organisms manage their energy resources. An understanding of energy is as important for students of biology as it is for students of physics, chemistry, and engineering.





 Organisms transform energy

Energy is the capacity to do work--that is, to move matter against opposing forces, such as gravity and friction. Put another way, energy is the ability to rearrange a collection of matter. For example, you expend energy to turn the pages of this book. Energy exists in various forms, and the work of life depends on the ability of cells to transform energy from one type into another.

Anything that moves possesses a form of energy called kinetic energy, the energy of motion. Moving objects perform work by imparting motion to other matter: A pool player uses the motion of the cue stick to push the cue ball, which in turn moves the other balls; water gushing through a dam turns turbines; electrons flowing along a wire run household appliances; the contraction of leg muscles pushes bicycle pedals. Light is also a type of kinetic energy that can be harnessed to perform work, such as powering photosynthesis in green plants. Heat, or thermal energy, is kinetic energy that results from the random movement of molecules.

A resting object not presently at work may still possess energy, which, remember, is the capacity to do work. Stored energy, or potential energy, is energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. Water behind a dam, for instance, stores energy because of its altitude. Chemical energy, a form of potential energy especially important to biologists, is stored in molecules as a result of the arrangement of the atoms in those molecules.

How is energy converted from one form to another? Consider, for example, the playground scene in FIGURE 6.2. The girl at the bottom of the slide transformed kinetic energy to potential energy when she climbed the ladder up to the slide. This stored energy was converted back to kinetic energy as she slid down. It was another source of potential energy--the chemical energy in the food she ate for breakfast--that enabled the girl to climb the ladder in the first place.

Fig 6-2. Transformations between kinetic and potential energy. The children have more potential energy at the top of the slide (because of the effect of gravity) than they do at the bottom.

Chemical energy can be tapped when chemical reactions rearrange the atoms of molecules in such a way that potential energy stored in the molecules is converted to kinetic energy. This transformation occurs, for example, in the engine of an automobile when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons. Similarly, chemical energy fuels organisms. Cellular respiration and other catabolic pathways unleash energy stored in sugar and other complex molecules and make that energy available for cellular work. Each child who climbed the ladder in FIGURE 6.2 transformed some of the chemical energy that was stored in the organic molecules of food to the kinetic energy of his or her movements. The chemical energy stored in these fuel molecules had itself been derived from light energy by plants during photosynthesis. Organisms are energy transformers.





 The energy transformations of life are subject t+o two laws of thermodynamics

The study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called thermodynamics. Scientists use the word system to denote the matter under study and refer to the rest of the universe--everything outside the system--as the surroundings. A closed system, such as that approximated by liquid in a thermos bottle, is isolated from its surroundings. In an open system, energy (and often matter) can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. Organisms are open systems. They absorb energy--for instance, light energy or chemical energy in the form of organic molecules--and release heat and metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide, to the surroundings. Two laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations in organisms and all other collections of matter (FIGURE 6.3).

Fig 6-3. Two laws of thermodynamics. (a) The chemical (potential) energy in the gasoline will be converted to kinetic energy of the car's movement. (b) Disorder is added to the car's surrounding in the form of heat and the small molecules that are breakdown products of gasoline.

The First Law of Thermodynamics

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the universe is constant. Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The first law is also known as the principle of conservation of energy. The electric company does not manufacture energy, but merely converts it to a form that is convenient to use. By converting light to chemical energy, a green plant acts as an energy transformer, not an energy producer.

The car in FIGURE 6.3a will convert the chemical energy of gasoline fuels to kinetic and other forms of energy as it is driven away from the gas station. What happens to this energy after it has performed work in a machine or an organism? If energy cannot be destroyed, what prevents organisms from behaving like closed systems and recycling their energy? The second law answers these questions.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics can be stated many ways. Let's begin with the following statement of the second law: Every energy transfer or transformation makes the universe more disordered. Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. The more random a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy. We can therefore restate the second law as follows: Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Although order can increase locally, there is an unstoppable trend toward randomization of the universe as a whole.

In many cases, increased entropy is evident in the physical disintegration of a system's organized structure. For example, you can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building. Much of the increasing entropy of the universe is less apparent, however, because it takes the form of an increasing amount of heat, which is the energy of random molecular motion. As the car in FIGURE 6.3b converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, it is also increasing the disorder of its surroundings in the form of heat and the small molecules that are the breakdown products of gasoline.

In most energy transformations, ordered forms of energy are at least partly converted to heat. Only about 25%  of the chemical energy stored in the fuel tank of an automobile is transformed into the motion of the car; the remaining 75%  is lost from the engine as heat, which dissipates rapidly through the surroundings. Similarly, the children in FIGURE 6.2 convert only a fraction of the energy stored in their food to the kinetic energy of ladder climbing and other play. In performing various kinds of work, living cells unavoidably convert organized forms of energy to heat. (This can make a room crowded with people uncomfortably warm.)

In machines and organisms, even energy that performs useful work is eventually converted to heat. The organized energy of an automobile's forward movement becomes heat when the friction of the brakes and tires stops the car. Conversion to heat is the fate of all the chemical energy a child uses to climb a slide: Metabolic breakdown of food generates heat during the climb, and the fraction of energy temporarily stored as gravitational potential energy is converted to heat on the way down, as friction warms the surrounding air.

Conversion of other forms of energy to heat does not violate the first law of thermodynamics. Energy has been conserved, because heat is a form of energy, though energy in its most random state. By combining the first and second laws of thermodynamics, we can conclude that the quantity of energy in the universe is constant, but its quality is not. In a sense, heat is the lowest grade of energy, as uncoordinated movement of molecules. A system can put heat to work only when there is a temperature difference that results in the heat flowing from a warmer location to a cooler one. If temperature is uniform, as it is in a living cell, then the only use for heat energy is to warm a body of matter, such as an organism.

How can we reconcile the second law of thermodynamics--the unstoppable increase in the entropy of the universe--with the orderliness of life (FIGURE 6.4), which is one of this book's themes? The key is to remember another theme: Organisms are open systems that exchange energy and materials with their surroundings. It is true that cells create ordered structures from less organized starting materials. For example, amino acids are ordered into the specific sequences of polypeptide chains. But an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms. For example, an animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases carbon dioxide and water--small, simple molecules that store less chemical energy than the food did. The depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism. On a larger scale, energy flows into an ecosystem in the form of light and leaves in the form of heat. Living systems increase the entropy of their surroundings, as predicted by thermodynamic law.

Fig 6-4. Order as a characteristic of life. Order is evident in the detailed anatomy of this root tissue from a buttercup plant (the micrograph shows a cross section). As open systems, organisms can increase their order at the expense of the order of their surroundings.

During the early history of life, complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors. For example, we can trace the ancestry of the plant kingdom to much simpler organisms called green algae. However, this increase in organization over time in no way violates the second law. The entropy of a particular system, such as an organism, may actually decrease, so long as the total entropy of the universe--the system plus its surroundings--increases. Thus, organisms are islands of low entropy in an increasingly random universe. The evolution of biological order is perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.





 Organisms live at the expense of free energy

How can we predict what can and cannot occur in nature? How can we distinguish the possible from the impossible? We know from experience that certain events occur spontaneously and others do not. For instance, we know that water flows downhill, that objects of opposite charge move toward each other, that an ice cube melts at room temperature, and that a sugar cube dissolves in water. Explaining why these processes occur spontaneously is tricky.

Let's begin by defining a spontaneous process as a change that can occur without outside help. A spontaneous change can be harnessed to perform work. The downhill flow of water can be used to turn a turbine in a power plant, for example. A process that cannot occur on its own is said to be nonspontaneous; it will happen only if energy is added to the system. Water moves uphill only when a windmill or some other machine pumps the water against gravity, and a cell must expend energy to synthesize a protein from amino acids.

When a spontaneous process occurs in a system, the stability of that system increases. Unstable systems tend to change in such a way that they become more stable. A body of elevated water, such as a reservoir, is less stable than the same water at sea level. A system of charged particles is less stable when opposite charges are apart than when they are together. A compressed spring is less stable than a relaxed one. In all of these examples, the system moves toward greater stability when nothing prevents such a change: The water falls, the opposite charges come together, the spring relaxes. In situations less familiar to us, how can we predict which changes lead to greater stability in a system--that is, which changes are spontaneous? You have already learned that a process can occur spontaneously only if it increases the disorder (entropy) of the universe. This principle is helpful in theory, but it does not give us a practical criterion to apply to biological systems because it requires that we measure changes in both the system and the surroundings. We need some standard for spontaneity that is based on the system alone. That criterion is called free energy.

Free Energy: A Criterion for Spontaneous Change

The concept of free energy is not easy to grasp, but the effort is worthwhile because we can apply the idea to many biological problems. Free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature is uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell. It is called free energy because it is available for work, not because it can be spent without cost to the universe. In fact, you will soon understand that organisms can live only at the expense of free energy acquired from the surroundings. FIGURE 6.5 illustrates the relationship of free energy to spontaneity, stability, and work.

Fig 6-5. The relationship of free energy to stability, work capacity, and spontaneous change. Unstable systems (top diagrams) are rich in free energy. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work. (a) In this case, free energy is proportional to the girl's altitude. (b) The free-energy concept also applies on the molecular scale, in this case to the movement of molecules known as diffusion. Here, molecules of a solute are distributed unequally across a membrane separating two aqueous compartments. This ordered state is unstable; it is rich in free energy. If the solute molecules can cross the membrane, there will be a net movement (diffusion) of the molecules until they are equally concentrated in the two compartments. (c) Chemical reactions also involve free energy. The sugar molecule on top is less stable than the simpler molecules below. When catabolic pathways break down complex organic molecules, a cell can perform work using the free energy that was stored in the more complex molecules.

A system's quantity of free energy is symbolized by the letter G. There are two components to G: the system's total energy (symbolized by H) and its entropy (symbolized by S). Free energy is related to these factors in the following way: 

where T stands for absolute temperature in Kelvin (K) units (K = &#176;C +273; see Appendix 2). Notice that temperature amplifies the entropy term of the equation. This makes sense if you remember that temperature measures the intensity of random molecular motion (heat), which tends to disrupt order. What does this equation tell us about free energy? Not all the energy stored in a system (H) is available for work. The system's disorder, the entropy factor, is subtracted from total energy in computing the maximum capacity of the system to perform useful work. We are then left with free energy, which is somewhat less than the system's total energy.

How does the concept of free energy help us determine whether a particular process can occur spontaneously? Think of free energy G as a measure of a system's instability--its tendency to change to a more stable state. Systems that are rich in energy, such as compressed springs or separated charges, are unstable; so are highly ordered systems, such as complex molecules. In other words, systems that tend to change spontaneously to a more stable state have high energy, low entropy, or both. The free-energy equation weighs these two factors, which are consolidated in the system's G content. Now we can state a versatile criterion for spontaneous change: In any spontaneous process, the free energy of a system decreases.

The change in free energy as a system goes from a starting state to a different state is represented by DG: 

Or, put another way:  For a process to occur spontaneously, the system must either give up energy (a decrease in H), give up order (an increase in S), or both. When these changes in H and S are tallied, DG must have a negative value (DG &lt; 0). The greater this decrease in free energy, the greater the maximum amount of work the spontaneous process can perform. This is a formal, mathematical way of stating the obvious: Nature runs "downhill" in the sense of a loss in useful energy, the capacity to perform work.

Free Energy and Equilibrium

Another term for a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions. There is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium, including chemical equilibrium. Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed until the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further change in the concentration of products or reactants. As a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases. Free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium. For a reaction at equilibrium, DG = 0, because there is no net change in the system. We can think of equilibrium as an energy valley. A chemical reaction or physical process at equilibrium performs no work. A process is spontaneous and can perform work when sliding toward equilibrium. Movement away from equilibrium is nonspontaneous; it can occur only with the help of an outside energy source. We can now apply the free-energy concept more specifically to the chemistry of life.

Free Energy and Metabolism

Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions in Metabolism. Based on their free-energy changes, chemical reactions can be classified as either exergonic ("energy outward") or endergonic ("energy inward"). An exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy (FIGURE 6.6a). Because the chemical mixture loses free energy, DG is negative for an exergonic reaction. In other words, exergonic reactions are those that occur spontaneously. The magnitude of DG for an exergonic reaction is the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform. We can use the overall reaction for cellular respiration as an example:

Fig 6-6. Energy changes in exergonic and endergonic reactions.

For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration, 686 kcal (or 2,870 kJ) of energy are made available for work (under what scientists call standard conditions). Because energy must be conserved, the chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy than the reactants. The products are, in a sense, the spent exhaust of a process that tapped most of the free energy stored in the sugar molecules.

An endergonic reaction is one that absorbs free energy from its surroundings (FIGURE 6.6b). Because this kind of reaction stores free energy in molecules, DG is positive. Such reactions are nonspontaneous, and the magnitude of DG is the quantity of energy required to drive the reaction. If a chemical process is exergonic (downhill) in one direction, then the reverse process must be endergonic (uphill). A reversible process cannot be downhill in both directions. If DG = - 686 kcal/mol for respiration, then for photosynthesis to produce sugar from carbon dioxide and water, DG = +686 kcal/mol. Sugar production in the leaf cells of a plant is steeply endergonic, an uphill process powered by the absorption of light energy.

Metabolic Disequilibrium. Reactions in a closed system eventually reach equilibrium and can do no work, as illustrated by the closed hydroelectric system in FIGURE 6.7a. The chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, and they, too, would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube. Because systems at equilibrium have a DG of zero and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead! In fact, metabolic disequilibrium is one of the defining features of life.

Fig 6-7. Disequilibrium and work in closed and open systems.

A cell can maintain disequilibrium because it is an open system. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in FIGURE 6.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in FIGURE 6.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction--that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to sustaining this disequilibrium is that the product of one reaction does not accumulate, but instead becomes a reactant in the next step. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose at the "uphill" end of the pathway and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as the cell has a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and is able to expel waste products to the surroundings, its metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and continue to do the work of life.

We see once again how important it is to think of organisms as open systems. Sunlight provides a daily source of free energy for an ecosystem's plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Animals and other nonphotosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem depend on free-energy transfusions in the form of the organic products of photosynthesis.

Now that we have applied the free-energy concept to metabolism, we are ready to see how a cell actually performs the work of life. A key feature of bioenergetics is energy coupling, the use of an exergonic process to drive an endergonic one. A molecule called ATP is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells.





 ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions

A cell does three main kinds of work:

Mechanical work, such as the beating of cilia, the contraction of muscle cells, and the movement of chromosomes during cellular reproduction

Transport work, the pumping of substances across membranes against the direction of spontaneous movement

Chemical work, the pushing of endergonic reactions that would not occur spontaneously, such as the synthesis of polymers from monomers

In most cases, the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work is ATP.

The Structure and Hydrolysis of ATP

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is closely related to one type of nucleotide found in nucleic acids. ATP has the nitrogenous base adenine bonded to ribose, as in an adenine nucleotide of RNA. In RNA, however, only one phosphate group is attached to the ribose (see FIGURE 5.29b), whereas adenosine triphosphate has a chain of three phosphate groups attached to the ribose (FIGURE 6.8a).

Fig 6-8. The structure and hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP yields inorganic phosphate and ADP. In the cell, most hydroxyl groups of phosphates are ionized (--O-).

The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP's tail can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (abbreviated 



 throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (FIGURE 6.8b). The reaction is exergonic and under laboratory conditions releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: 

This is the free-energy change measured under what are called standard conditions. However, the chemical and physical conditions in the cell do not conform to standard conditions. When the reaction occurs in the cellular environment rather than in a test tube, the actual DG is about - 13 kcal/mol, 78%  greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions.

Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply. In fact, compared to most bonds in organic molecules, these bonds are relatively weak, and it is because they are somewhat unstable that their hydrolysis yields energy. The products of hydrolysis (ADP and 



) are more stable than ATP. When a system changes in the direction of greater stability--when a compressed spring relaxes, for instance--the change is exergonic. Thus, the release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a more stable condition, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.

Why are the phosphate bonds so fragile? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in FIGURE 6.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a loaded spring.

How ATP Performs Work

When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In the cell, that would be an inefficient and dangerous use of a valuable energy resource. With the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis directly to endergonic processes by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule. The recipient of the phosphate group is then said to be phosphorylated. The key to the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original molecule. FIGURE 6.9 shows a cellular process that exemplifies this mechanism: the synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid (another amino acid) and ammonia.

Fig 6-9. Energy coupling by phosphate transfer. In this example, ATP hydrolysis drives the conversion of the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) to another amino acid, glutamine (Glu--NH2).

Nearly all cellular work depends on ATP's energizing of other molecules by transferring phosphate groups. For instance, when ATP powers the movement of muscles, it transfers phosphate groups to contractile proteins.

The Regeneration of ATP

An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (FIGURE 6.10). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding processes to the energy-producing ones. The ATP cycle moves at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP about once each minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would consume nearly their body weight in ATP each day.

Fig 6-10. The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. Thus, ATP couples the cell's energy-yielding processes to the energy-consuming ones.

Because a reversible process cannot go downhill both ways, the regeneration of ATP from ADP is necessarily endergonic:  Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP.

Thus, the ATP cycle is a turnstile through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways. In fact, the energy temporarily stored in ATP drives most cellular work.





 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers

A catalyst is a chemical agent that changes the rate of a reaction without being consumed by the reaction; an enzyme is a catalytic protein. (Another class of biological catalysts, ribozymes, made of RNA, is discussed in Chapters 17 and 26.) In the absence of enzymes, chemical traffic through the pathways of metabolism would become hopelessly congested. In the next two sections, we will see what impedes a spontaneous reaction and how an enzyme changes the situation.

The Activation Energy Barrier

Every chemical reaction between molecules involves both bond breaking and bond forming. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose involves first breaking the bond between glucose and fructose and then forming new bonds with a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group from water (see FIGURE 6.11). Whenever a reaction rearranges the atoms of molecules, existing bonds in the reactants must be broken and the new bonds of the products formed. The reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings for their bonds to break, and energy is released when the new bonds of the product molecules are formed.

The initial investment of energy for starting a reaction--the energy required to break bonds in the reactant molecules--is known as the free energy of activation, or activation energy, abbreviated EA in this book. It is usually provided in the form of heat that the reactant molecules absorb from the surroundings. The bonds of the reactants break only when the molecules have absorbed enough energy to become unstable. (Recall that systems rich in free energy are unstable, and unstable systems are reactive.) The absorption of thermal energy increases the speed of the reactant molecules, so they are colliding more often and more forcefully. Also, thermal agitation of the atoms in the molecules makes the bonds more likely to break. As the molecules settle into their new, more stable bonding arrangements, energy is released to the surroundings. If the reaction is exergonic, EA will be repaid with dividends, as the formation of new bonds releases more energy than was invested in the breaking of old bonds.

We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants over an energy barrier, or hill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin. FIGURE 6.12 graphs the energy changes for a hypothetical exergonic reaction that swaps portions of two reactant molecules:  The energizing, or activation, of the reactants is represented by the uphill portion of the graph, with the free-energy content of the reactant molecules increasing. At the summit, the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state: They are activated, and the breaking and making of bonds can occur. The bond-forming phase of the reaction corresponds to the downhill part of the curve, which shows the loss of free energy by the molecules. The difference between the free energy of the products and the free energy of the reactants is DG for the overall reaction. Because this is an exergonic reaction, DG is negative.

Using the reaction in FIGURE 6.11 as an example, you can imagine that AB = sucrose (glucose monomer--fructose monomer), CD = water (with C = hydroxyl group and D = hydrogen), AC = glucose, and BD = fructose.

As FIGURE 6.12 shows, even for an exergonic reaction, which is energetically downhill overall, the barrier of activation energy must be scaled before the reaction can occur. For some reactions, EA is modest enough that even at room temperature there is sufficient thermal energy for many of the reactants to reach the transition state. In most cases, however, the EA barrier is loftier, and the reaction will occur at a noticeable rate only if the reactants are heated. The spark plugs in an automobile engine energize the gasoline-oxygen mixture so that the molecules reach the transition state and react; only then can there be the explosive release of energy that pushes the pistons. Without a spark, the hydrocarbons of gasoline are too stable to react with oxygen.

Enzymes and Activation Energy

The barrier of activation energy is essential to life. Proteins, DNA, and other complex molecules of the cell are rich in free energy and have the potential to decompose spontaneously; that is, the laws of thermodynamics favor their breakdown. These molecules exist only because at temperatures typical for cells, few molecules can make it over the hump of activation energy. Occasionally, however, the barrier for selected reactions must be surmounted, or else the cell would be metabolically stagnant. Heat speeds a reaction, but high temperature denatures proteins and kills cells. Organisms must therefore use an alternative: a catalyst.

An enzyme speeds a reaction by lowering the EA barrier (FIGURE 6.13), so that the precipice of the transition state is within reach even at moderate temperatures. An enzyme cannot change the DG for a reaction; it cannot make an endergonic reaction exergonic. Enzymes can only hasten reactions that would occur eventually anyway, but this function makes it possible for the cell to have a dynamic metabolism. And because enzymes are very selective in the reactions they catalyze, they determine which chemical processes will be going on in the cell at any particular time.

Fig 6-13. Enzymes lower the barrier of activation energy. Without affecting the free-energy change (DG) for the reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing the uphill climb to the transition state. The black curve shows the course of the reaction without an enzyme; the red curve shows the course of the reaction with an enzyme.





 Enzymes are substrate specific

The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme's substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate (or substrates, when there are two or more reactants). While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product (or products) of the reaction. The overall process can be summarized as follows, with the name of the enzyme written above the reaction arrow:  For example, the enzyme sucrase (most enzyme names end in -ase) breaks the disaccharide sucrose into its two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose (see FIGURE 6.11):  An enzyme can distinguish its substrate from even closely related compounds, such as isomers, so that each type of enzyme catalyzes a particular reaction. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will reject other disaccharides, such as maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional conformations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape.

Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the protein (FIGURE 6.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that reinforces the configuration of the active site. The specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate. The active site, however, is not a rigid receptacle for the substrate. As the substrate enters the active site, it induces the enzyme to change its shape slightly so that the active site fits even more snugly around the substrate (FIGURE 6.14b). This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.

(a) The active site of this enzyme (hexokinase) can be seen in this computer graphic model as a groove on the surface of the protein (blue). (b) On entering the active site, the substrate, which is glucose (red), induces a change in the shape of the protein that causes the active site to embrace the substrate.





 The active site is an enzyme's catalytic center

In an enzymatic reaction, the substrate binds to the active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex (FIGURE 6.15). In most cases, the substrate is held in the active site by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. Side chains (R groups) of a few of the amino acids that make up the active site catalyze the conversion of substrate to product, and the product departs from the active site. The enzyme is then free to take another substrate molecule into its active site. The entire cycle happens so fast that a single enzyme molecule typically acts on about a thousand substrate molecules per second. Some enzymes are much faster. Enzymes, like other catalysts, emerge from the reaction in their original form. Therefore, very small amounts of enzyme can have a huge metabolic impact by functioning over and over again in catalytic cycles.

Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze both the forward and the reverse reactions. Which reaction prevails depends mainly on the relative concentrations of reactants and products; that is, the enzyme catalyzes the reaction in the direction of equilibrium.

Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction. In reactions involving two or more reactants, the active site provides a template for the substrates to come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them. As the active site clutches the substrates with an induced fit, the enzyme may stress the substrate molecules, stretching and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction. Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking bonds, distorting the substrate reduces the amount of thermal energy that must be absorbed to achieve a transition state.

The active site may also provide a microenvironment that is conducive to a particular type of reaction. For example, if the active site has amino acids with acidic side chains (R groups), the active site may be a pocket of low pH in an otherwise neutral cell. In such cases, an acidic amino acid may facilitate H+ transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction. Still another mechanism of catalysis is the direct participation of the active site in the chemical reaction. Sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and a side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme. Subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states, so the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before.

The rate at which a given amount of enzyme converts substrate to product is partly a function of the initial concentration of the substrate: The more substrate molecules available, the more frequently they access the active sites of the enzyme molecules. However, there is a limit to how fast the reaction can be pushed by adding more substrate to a fixed concentration of enzyme. At some point, the concentration of substrate will be high enough that all enzyme molecules have their active sites engaged. As soon as the product exits an active site, another substrate molecule enters. At this substrate concentration, the enzyme is said to be saturated, and the rate of the reaction is determined by the speed at which the active site can convert substrate to product. When an enzyme population is saturated, the only way to increase productivity is to add more enzyme. Cells sometimes do this by making more enzyme molecules.





 A cell's physical and chemical environment affects enzyme activity

The activity of an enzyme is affected by general environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, and also by particular chemicals that specifically influence that enzyme.

Effects of Temperature and pH

Recall from Chapter 5 that the three-dimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment. As a protein, an enzyme has conditions under which it works optimally, because that environment favors the most active conformation for the enzyme molecule.

Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the velocity of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Beyond that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active conformation, and the protein molecule denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is fastest. This temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions without denaturing the enzyme. Most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40&#176;C (close to human body temperature). Bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70&#176;C or higher (FIGURE 6.16a).

Fig 6-16. Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the active conformation of the protein molecule.

Just as each enzyme has an optimal temperature, it also has a pH at which it is most active. The optimal pH values for most enzymes fall in the range of pH 6-8, but there are exceptions. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, works best at pH 2. Such an acidic environment denatures most enzymes, but the active conformation of pepsin is adapted to the acidic environment of the stomach. In contrast, trypsin, a digestive enzyme residing in the alkaline environment of the intestine, has an optimal pH of 8 (FIGURE 6.16b).

Cofactors

Many enzymes require nonprotein helpers for catalytic activity. These adjuncts, called cofactors, may be bound tightly to the active site as permanent residents, or they may bind loosely and reversibly along with the substrate. The cofactors of some enzymes are inorganic, such as the metal atoms zinc, iron, and copper in ionic form. If the cofactor is an organic molecule, it is more specifically called a coenzyme. Most vitamins are coenzymes or raw materials from which coenzymes are made. Cofactors function in various ways, but in all cases they are necessary for catalysis to take place. You'll encounter examples of cofactors later in the book.

Enzyme Inhibitors

Certain chemicals selectively inhibit the action of specific enzymes (FIGURE 6.17). If the inhibitor attaches to the enzyme by covalent bonds, inhibition is usually irreversible. It is reversible, however, if the inhibitor binds by weak bonds.

Fig 6-17. Inhibition of enzyme activity.

Some reversible inhibitors resemble the normal substrate molecule and compete for admission into the active site. These mimics, called competitive inhibitors, reduce the productivity of enzymes by blocking substrates from entering active sites. This kind of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate so that as active sites become available, more substrate molecules than inhibitor molecules are around to gain entry to the sites.

So-called noncompetitive inhibitors do not directly compete with the substrate at the active site. Instead, they impede enzymatic reactions by binding to another part of the enzyme. This interaction causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape, rendering the active site unreceptive to substrate or leaving the enzyme less effective at catalyzing the conversion of substrate to product.

Some poisons absorbed from an organism's environment act by inhibiting enzymes. For example, the pesticides DDT and parathion are inhibitors of key enzymes in the nervous system. Many antibiotics are inhibitors of specific enzymes in bacteria. For instance, penicillin blocks the active site of an enzyme that many bacteria use to make their cell walls.

Mentioning enzyme inhibitors that are metabolic poisons may give the impression that enzyme inhibition is generally abnormal and harmful. In fact, selective inhibition and activation of enzymes by molecules naturally present in the cell are essential mechanisms in metabolic control, as we discuss next.





 Metabolic control often dependson allosteric regulation

In many cases, the molecules that naturally regulate enzyme activity in a cell behave something like reversible noncompetitive inhibitors (see FIGURE 6.17c): These regulatory molecules change an enzyme's shape and function by binding weakly to an allosteric site, a specific receptor site on some part of the enzyme molecule remote from the active site. The effect of this allosteric regulation may be either inhibition or stimulation of the enzyme's activity.

Allosteric Regulation

Most allosterically regulated enzymes are constructed from two or more polypeptide chains, or subunits (FIGURE 6.18). Each subunit has its own active site, and allosteric sites are often located where subunits are joined. The entire complex oscillates between two conformational states, one catalytically active and the other inactive. The binding of an activator to an allosteric site stabilizes the conformation that has a functional active site, whereas the binding of an allosteric inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme. The areas of contact between the subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in such a way that a conformational change in one subunit is transmitted to all others. Through this interaction of subunits, a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one allosteric site will affect the active sites of all subunits.

Fig 6-18. Allosteric regulation of enzyme activity.

The activity of an allosteric enzyme changes in response to fluctuating concentrations of the regulators. In some cases, an inhibitor and an activator are similar enough in shape to compete for the same allosteric site. For example, some enzymes of catabolic pathways may have an allosteric site that fits both ATP and AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which the cell routinely derives from ADP. Such enzymes are inhibited by ATP and activated by AMP. This is logical because a major function of catabolism is to regenerate ATP. If ATP production lags behind its use, AMP accumulates and activates key enzymes that speed up catabolism. If the supply of ATP exceeds demand, then catabolism slows down as ATP molecules accumulate and compete for allosteric sites. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of key reactions in metabolic pathways.

Feedback Inhibition

The inhibition of an ATP-generating catabolic pathway by the allosteric binding of ATP to an enzyme in the pathway is an example of feedback inhibition, one of the most common methods of metabolic control. Feedback inhibition is the switching off of a metabolic pathway by its end product, which acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme within the pathway. FIGURE 6.19 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Some cells use this pathway of five steps to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine, the end product of the pathway, accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the very first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources to synthesize more isoleucine than is necessary.

Fig 6-19. Feedback inhibition. Many metabolic pathways are switched off by an end product, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of an enzyme earlier in the pathway. This example is the pathway for synthesizing the amino acid isoleucine. (Enzyme 1 is actually a tetramer of four identical subunits, like the hypothetical enzyme in FIGURE 6.18.)

Cooperativity

By a mechanism that resembles allosteric activation, substrate molecules may stimulate the catalytic powers of an enzyme (FIGURE 6.20). Recall that the binding of a substrate to an enzyme can induce a favorable change in the shape of the enzyme's active site (induced fit). If an enzyme has two or more subunits, such an interaction with one substrate molecule can trigger the same favorable conformational change in all other subunits of the enzyme. Called cooperativity, this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates: One substrate molecule primes an enzyme to accept additional substrate molecules more readily.

Fig 6-20. Cooperativity. In an enzyme molecule with multiple subunits, the binding of one substrate molecule to the active site of one subunit causes all the subunits to assume their active conformation.





 The localization of enzymes withina cell helps order metabolism

The cell is not just a bag of chemicals with thousands of different kinds of enzymes and substrates wandering about randomly. Structures within the cell help bring order to metabolic pathways. In some cases, a team of enzymes for several steps of a metabolic pathway is assembled together as a multienzyme complex. The arrangement controls the sequence of reactions, as the product from the first enzyme becomes substrate for the adjacent enzyme in the complex, and so on, until the end product is released. Some enzymes and enzyme complexes have fixed locations within the cell as structural components of particular membranes. Others are in solution within specific membrane-enclosed eukaryotic organelles, each with its own internal chemical environment. For example, in eukaryotic cells the enzymes for cellular respiration reside within mitochondria (FIGURE 6.21). If the cell had the same number of enzyme molecules for respiration but they were diluted throughout the entire volume of the cell, respiration would be very inefficient.

Membranes partition a eukaryotic cell into various metabolic compartments, or organelles, each with a corps of enzymes that carry out specific functions. The organelles shown in this micrograph are mitochondria, the sites of cellular respiration.

The structural basis of metabolic order brings us back to the theme with which this unit of chapters began.





 The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review

Recall that life is organized along a hierarchy of structural levels. With each increase in the level of order, new properties emerge in addition to those of the component parts. In Chapters 2-6, we have dissected the chemistry of life using the strategy of the reductionist. But we have also begun to develop a more integrated view of life as we have seen how properties emerge with increasing order.

We have seen that the unusual behavior of water, so essential to life on Earth, results from interactions of the water molecules, themselves an ordered arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. We reduced the great complexity and diversity of organic compounds to the chemical characteristics of carbon, but we also saw that the unique properties of organic compounds are related to the specific structural arrangements of carbon skeletons and their appended functional groups. We learned that small organic molecules are often assembled into giant molecules, but we also discovered that a macromolecule does not behave like a simple composite of its monomers. For example, the unique form and function of a protein are consequences of a hierarchy of primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. And in this chapter we have learned that metabolism, that orderly chemistry that characterizes life, is a concerted interplay of thousands of different kinds of molecules in an organized cell.

By completing our overview of metabolism with an introduction to its structural basis in the compartmentalized cell, we have built a bridge to Unit Two, where we will study the cell's structure and function in more depth. We will maintain our balance between the need to reduce life to a conglomerate of simpler processes and the ultimate satisfaction of viewing those processes in their integrated context.
