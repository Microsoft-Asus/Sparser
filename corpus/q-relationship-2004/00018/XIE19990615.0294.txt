SEOUL , June 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A torpedo boat of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- was hit and sunken by South Korean Navy in the Yellow Sea on Tuesday morning after an exchange of fire for 10 minutes , the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a press release .
Meanwhile , a DPRK patrol boat was targeted but it retreated to the North side .
Three DPRK torpedo boats and two patrol vessels crossed the Northern Limit Line -LRB- NLL -RRB- around 9 : 25 a.m .
Tuesday and entered the buffer zone off the west coast of South Korea 's Yongyong Islands , the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said .
The DPRK torpedo boat which was sunken fired at and damaged one of the South Korean patrol ships which were trying to block the incursion of the DPRK military ships , it alleged .
It was the first exchange of fire between the two sides after an eight-day military standoff in the Yellow Sea .
The inter- Korean tension began Monday last week after several DPRK patrol boats reportedly crossed the NLL escorting fishing boats and entered the buffer zone every day .
South Korea regards the buffer zone , set up south of the Northern Limit Line after the 1950-1953 Korean War , as its territorial waters .
However , the DPRK does not recognize the existence of the buffer zone and claims jurisdiction over the area , arguing that the 1953 armistice agreement does not stipulate a maritime border line between the two countries .
Tuesday 's firing incident took place as general officers ' talks are going on at Panmunjom between the Korean People 's Army and the U.S. army .
At the talks , the DPRK side lodged `` strong protest with the U.S. military side against military provocations being committed by South Korean naval vessels in the north side 's territorial waters off the west coast of Korea , '' the Korea Central News Agency reported .
As tension escalates between the two sides , South Korean President Kim Dae -jung 's `` sunshine policy '' of engagement with the DPRK has come under strong criticism again over recent days .
