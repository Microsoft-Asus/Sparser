Recombinant DNA is made by inserting restriction fragments from DNA containing a gene of interest into the vector DNA, which has been cut open by the same enzyme. Gene cloning results when the foreign genes replicate inside the host bacterial cell as part of the recombinant vector. Eukaryotic cells can also serve as host cells for gene cloning. Cell clones carrying the gene of interest can be identified with a radioactively labeled nucleic acid probe, which has a sequence complementary to the gene.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity20C:<span class="Emphasis1">

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are differences in DNA sequence on homologous chromosomes that result in different patterns of restriction fragment lengths. These patterns are visualized as bands on gel electrophoresis. Specific fragments can be identified by Southern blotting, using labeled probes that hybridize to the DNA stuck to a "blot" of the gel. RFLPs are prevalent genetic markers, present throughout eukaryotic noncoding DNA. RFLP analysis has many applications, including genetic mapping and diagnosis of genetic disorders.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity20D:<span class="Emphasis1">
