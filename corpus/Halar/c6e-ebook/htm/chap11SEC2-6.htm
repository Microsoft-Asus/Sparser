Like falling dominoes, the signal-activated receptor activates another protein, which activates another molecule, and so on, until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated. The molecules that relay a signal from receptor to response, sometimes called relay molecules, are mostly proteins. The interaction of proteins is a major theme of cell signaling. Indeed, protein interaction is a unifying theme of all regulation at the cellular level.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Keep in mind that the original signal molecule is not physically passed along a signaling pathway; in most cases, it never even enters the cell. When we say that the signal is relayed along a pathway, we mean that certain information is passed on. At each step the signal is transduced into a different form, commonly a conformational change in a protein. Very often, the conformational change is brought about by phosphorylation.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
