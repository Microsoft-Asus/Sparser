VIENNA , Austria --
As they slipped out of their black limousines into luxury hotels dotting the contours of Vienna 's graceful Stadtpark Sunday night , officials of OPEC , the nearly moribund oil cartel , were stirring with new life , ready to jolt oil prices back up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">If all goes well at an emergency meeting set for Tuesday here , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , in partnership with major oil producers like Mexico and Norway who are not members of the group , will take more than 2 million barrels of oil a day out of world markets , starting in April</ENAMEX> .
It would mark the first time in 13 years that the cartel has taken such a drastic measure , largely because of the pressing needs of the largest producer , Saudi Arabia , and other producing countries to generate more revenue , experts say .
Anticipation of the move -- which has emerged as OPEC officials formulated it in secret and in public talks held in Riyadh , The Hague , Dubai , London and other cities in the last four weeks -- has already pushed prices up 20 percent , bringing the American benchmark brand known as West Texas Intermediate to $ 15 a barrel .
This has halted , for a while at least , the steady fall in prices that devastated the world energy industry in the last year .
Part of the impact reflects optimism in the oil industry that salvation is on the way .
In the last decade , globalization , competition from new oil suppliers and disputes within OPEC combined to send oil prices into a seemingly endless tumble to a point where gasoline and fuel prices today are , in inflation-adjusted prices , the lowest since the end of the World War II .
Now , a confluence of new circumstances may help the cartel reverse some of these trends .
Among other things , the Asian economic crisis , which erased more than 1.5 million barrels a day in demand for oil , is stabilizing .
Iraqi oil production is also stabilizing .
In 1998 Iraq more than doubled its oil production to 2.5 million barrels a day as the United Nations allowed it to sell more oil under its oil-for-food sanctions regime .
That ceiling cannot increase much more now unless the United Nations sanctions are removed altogether -- something the United States would not allow .
Above all , the pain of lower prices has piled mountains of debt onto the economies of many oil-producing countries , cut their government budgets down to a point of endangering social and political cohesion , and ravaged oil company profits worldwide -- enough to create a consensus for OPEC discipline and worldwide cooperation .
`` The worst seems to be over , '' said Robert Mabro , director of the Oxford University Institute for Energy Studies in England .
`` They have to act because low prices are deeply hurting producing countries and oil companies .
Hard currency revenues are shrinking dangerously in places like Nigeria , Venezuela , Russia , Mexico .
Multinational oil companies have cut costs to the bone , laid off thousands of people and seen their profits evaporate .
Everybody wants a solution , '' Underlying the seriousness of the action , Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest oil producer and most important OPEC member , has agreed to take the biggest cut , shutting down half a million barrels of oil a day of its production starting in April .
`` As far as we are concerned , it 's a done deal , '' said a senior Saudi official in Riyadh , who asked not to be identified .
`` We are informing customers right now that deliveries will be cut . ''
Iran , Kuwait , Venezuela , Algeria , Libya , Indonesia , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar and Indonesia are joining in with cuts that total about 1.5 million barrels a day .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Norway and Mexico , major oil producers and allies of the United States who are not members of OPEC , intend to cut their production by a combined 350,000 barrels daily</ENAMEX> .
This is a remarkable show of solidarity unseen since 1986 , when a similar collapse in prices led producers to drastic and coordinated production cuts .
While still frowning on any concerted action to control prices of such a vital commodity , the United States appears not to object to stronger oil prices , which would also help the American oil industry .
It too has been deeply hurt by the price collapse , resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs .
`` We feel that lower oil prices are good for consumers , but we recognize they can have a negative impact domestically and on some of our friends like Venezuela and Mexico , '' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a telephone conversation from Washington on Friday .
`` So far , OPEC 's response has been responsible and restrained . ''
It is Saudi Arabia , the cartel 's undisputed master and America 's staunch Persian Gulf ally , that holds the fate of the accord in hand .
As owner of the world 's largest petroleum reserve , Saudi Arabia had two ways to go .
`` They could go back , as they have done now , revert to their old standard of constraining production and hope that prices will go up , '' said Anthony Miles , senior vice president at the San Francisco office of the Boston Consulting Group .
`` Or they can swing all the way , pumping as much oil as possible , and the guys with the most oil will win . ''
It will take some months to determine whether OPEC 's new discipline will hold .
The big deterrent to cheating is Saudi Arabia 's unique ability to flood the market .
With prolific oil fields , Miles and other experts point out , the desert kingdom can pump more than 10 million barrels a day at minimal extraction costs of $ 1 a barrel .
This flooding would bring prices down to as low as $ 5 a barrel in a few months .
Few oil-producing countries can take this possibility lightly .
In the long run , it would put many producers out of business in the United States , the Caspian Sea , Russia and the prolific North Sea shared by Norway and Britain , where production costs range from $ 5 to $ 10 a barrel .
The Saudis ' need to produce higher revenues has become compelling .
Piling one budget deficit over another in the last decade , Saudi Arabia has accumulated a debt of $ 130 billion , the equivalent of its entire annual economic output .
As a result , after tenaciously clinging to a level of production set since 1990 at 8 million barrels a day , Saudi Arabia for the first time has offered to lower it to 7.5 million barrels a day .
This is a fundamental change in policy .
`` The eight-million level was practically untouchable -- it had become an icon-hobbling policy , '' said Amy Myers Jaffe , a senior oil analyst at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston .
`` The willingness to abandon it shows the urgency they attach to higher revenues now . ''
