Many signaling pathways also involve small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions, called <span class="Emphasis2">second messengers.</span> (The extracellular signal molecule that binds to the membrane receptor is a pathway’s "first messenger.") Because second messengers are both small and water-soluble, they can readily spread throughout the cell by diffusion. For example, as we’ll see shortly, it is a second messenger called cyclic AMP that carries the signal initiated by epinephrine from the plasma membrane of a liver or muscle cell into the cell’s interior, where it brings about glycogen breakdown. Second messengers participate in pathways initiated by both G-protein-linked receptors and tyrosine-kinase receptors. The two most widely used second messengers are cyclic AMP and calcium ions, Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>. A large variety of relay proteins are sensitive to the cytosolic concentration of one or the other of these second messengers.</p><p class="Header3">Cyclic AMP</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Once Earl Sutherland had established that epinephrine somehow causes glycogen breakdown without passing through the plasma membrane, the search began for the second messenger (he coined the term) that transmits the signal from the plasma membrane to the metabolic machinery in the cytoplasm.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Sutherland found that the binding of epinephrine to the plasma membrane of a liver cell elevates the cytosolic concentration of a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, abbreviated <span class="Emphasis2">cyclic AMP</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">cAMP</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.12</span>). An enzyme built into the plasma membrane, <span class="Emphasis2">adenylyl cyclase,</span> converts ATP to cAMP in response to an extracellular signal--in this case, epinephrine. Adenylyl cyclase becomes active only after epinephrine binds to a specific receptor protein. Thus, the first messenger, the hormone, causes a membrane enzyme to make cAMP, which broadcasts the signal to the cytoplasm. The cAMP does not persist for long in the absence of the hormone, because another enzyme converts the cAMP to an inactive product, AMP. Another surge of epinephrine is needed to boost the cytosolic concentration of cAMP again.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig11-12','../fig/big/fig11-12.jpg','fig11-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig11-12.jpg" alt="fig11-12" name="myfig11-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 11-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Cyclic AMP.</span> Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is made from ATP by adenylyl cyclase, an emzyme embedded in the plasma membrane.

Consider cholera, a disease that is frequently epidemic in places where the water supply is contaminated with human feces. People acquire the cholera bacterium, <span class="Emphasis1">Vibrio cholerae,</span> by drinking contaminated water. The bacteria colonize the lining of the small intestine and produce a toxin, which is an enzyme that chemically modifies a G protein involved in regulating salt and water secretion. Because the modified G protein is unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, it remains stuck in its active form, continuously stimulating adenylyl cyclase to make cAMP. The resulting high concentration of cAMP causes the intestinal cells to secrete large amounts of water and salts into the intestines. An infected person quickly develops profuse diarrhea and if left untreated can soon die from the loss of water and salts.</p><p class="Header3">Calcium Ions and Inositol Trisphosphate</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Many signal molecules in animals, including neurotransmitters, growth factors, and some hormones, induce responses in their target cells via signal-transduction pathways that increase the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions (Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>). Calcium is even more widely used than cAMP as a second messenger. Increasing the cytosolic concentration of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> causes many responses in animal cells, including muscle cell contraction, secretion of certain substances, and cell division. In plant cells, calcium functions as a second messenger in signaling pathways plants have evolved for coping with environmental stresses, such as drought or cold. Cells use Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> as a second messenger in both G-protein pathways and tyrosine-kinase pathways.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">Although cells always contain some Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>, this ion can function as a second messenger because its concentration in the cytosol is normally much lower than the concentration outside the cell. In fact, the level of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> in the blood and extracellular fluid of an animal often exceeds that in the cytosol by more than 10,000 times. Calcium ions are actively transported out of the cell and are actively imported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (and, under some conditions, into mitochondria and chloroplasts) by various protein pumps (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.14</span>). As a result, the calcium concentration in the ER is usually much higher than in the cytosol. Because the cytosolic calcium level is low, a small change in absolute numbers of ions represents a relatively large percentage change in calcium concentration.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig11-14','../fig/big/fig11-14.jpg','fig11-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig11-14.jpg" alt="fig11-14" name="myfig11-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 11-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The maintenance of calcium ion concentrations in an animal cell.</span> The Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> concentration in the cytosol is usually much lower (light blue) than in the extracellular fluid and ER (darker blue).
