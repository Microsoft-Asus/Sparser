As described in the interview at the beginning of this unit, Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University are documenting natural selection and evolution in populations of finches in the Gal&aacute;pagos. We will now look at two additional examples of natural selection as a pervasive mechanism of evolution in populations.</p><p class="Header3">Natural Selection in Action: The Evolution of Insecticide-Resistant Insects</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">A classic and unsettling example of natural selection is the evolution of insecticide resistance in hundreds of insect species. Insecticides are poisons used to kill insects that are pests in farmlands, swamps, backyards, and homes. Examples are DDT, now banned in many countries, and malathion. We have used insecticides to control insects that eat our crops, transmit diseases such as malaria, or just annoy us around the house or campground, but these chemical weapons have proved to be double-edged swords. These poisons are not specific for the intended targets, and their widespread use has produced some colossal environmental problems, which we’ll examine in Chapter 54. Our focus here is the evolutionary outcome of introducing these chemicals into the environments of insects.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Whenever a new type of insecticide is used to control agricultural pests, the story is usually the same. Early results are encouraging. A relatively small amount of the poison dusted onto a crop may kill 99%  of the insects. But subsequent sprayings are less and less effective. One response is to increase the amount of the poison, but that brings high monetary (not to mention environmental) costs. Another strategy is for the farmer to switch to a different insecticide until it, too, becomes ineffective.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">It is natural selection that causes the evolution of resistance to insecticides. The relatively few survivors of the first insecticide wave are insects with genes that somehow enable them to resist the chemical attack (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 22.12</span>). In some cases, the lucky few carry genes coding for enzymes that destroy the insecticide. The poison kills most members of the insect population, leaving the resistant individuals to reproduce. And their offspring inherit the genes for insecticide resistance. In each generation, the proportion of insecticide-resistant individuals in the insect population increases. The population has adapted to a change in its environment.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig22-12','../fig/big/fig22-12.jpg','fig22-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig22-12.jpg" alt="fig22-12" name="myfig22-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 22-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Evolution of insecticide resistance in insect populations.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">This example of insect adaptation to insecticides highlights two key points about natural selection. First, notice that natural selection is more a process of editing than it is a creative mechanism. An insecticide does not create resistant individuals, but selects for resistant insects that were already present in the population. Second, note again that natural selection is contingent on time and place. It favors those characteristics in a varying population that fit the current, local environment. What is adaptive in one situation may be useless or even detrimental in different circumstances. For example, some genetic mutations that endow houseflies with resistance to the insecticide DDT also reduce a fly’s growth rate. Before DDT was introduced to environments, those particular genes were a handicap. But the appearance of DDT changed the environmental arena and favored insecticide-resistant individuals.</p><p class="Header3">Natural Selection in Action: The Evolution of Drug-Resistant HIV</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Researchers have developed numerous drugs to combat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS (see Chapter 18). In every case, resistance to a drug evolves rapidly in the HIV population of an individual patient soon after treatment with that drug begins. For example, <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 22.13</span> illustrates the evolution of resistance to a drug named 3TC. Notice that the 3TC-resistant forms of HIV begin to increase in number almost immediately and make up 100%  of the total HIV population in each patient after just a few weeks.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig22-13','../fig/big/fig22-13.jpg','fig22-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig22-13.jpg" alt="fig22-13" name="myfig22-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 22-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Evolution of drug resistance in HIV.</span> In patients being treated with the anti-HIV drug 3TC, a very small number of drug-resistant viruses are present at the beginning of the treatment, but natural selection increases their frequency over time. Though the exact time course differs between patients, 3TC-resistant HIV makes up 100%  of the virus populations within a few weeks in all cases.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Scientists designed the drug 3TC to interfere with reverse transcriptase, the enzyme HIV uses to copy its RNA genome into the DNA of the human host cell (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 18.7</span>). DNA, remember, is a polymer of four kinds of nucleotides, abbreviated A, G, T, and C (see Chapter 16). The drug 3TC mimics the C (cytosine) nucleotide of DNA. The HIV’s reverse transcriptase will pick up a 3TC molecule instead of C and insert it into a growing DNA chain. This error terminates further elongation of the DNA and thus blocks reproduction of the HIV.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">The 3TC-resistant variety of HIV has a slightly different version of reverse transcriptase that is able to discriminate between the drug and the normal C nucleotide. Members of the HIV population that inherit the gene for this form of the enzyme have no advantage in the absence of 3TC; in fact, they replicate their DNA more slowly than the "normal" variety of HIV. But once 3TC is added to the environment of these viruses, it becomes a potent force in natural selection, favoring reproduction of the resistant individuals.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
