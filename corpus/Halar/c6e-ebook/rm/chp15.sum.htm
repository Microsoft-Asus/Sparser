These events include crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes during the first meiotic division. A recombination frequency under 50%  indicates that the genes are linked but that crossing over has occurred. During prophase of meiosis I, paired homologous chromosomes break at corresponding points and switch fragments, creating new combinations of alleles that are then passed on to the gametes.</p></LI><LI><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Geneticists can use recombination data to map a chromosome’s genetic loci (pp. 275-276,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 15.6</span>) One way to map genes is to deduce their order and a rough indication of the relative distances between them from crossover data. The further apart genes are on a chromosome, the more likely they are to be separated during crossing over. Cytological mapping is a technique that pinpoints the physical locus of a gene by associating a mutant phenotype with a chromosomal defect seen in the microscope.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity15A:<span class="Emphasis1">

Humans and other mammals have an X-Y system, as do fruit flies. An XY male gives either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome to the sperm, which combines with an ovum containing an X chromosome from an XX female. The offspring’s sex is determined at conception by whether the sperm carries X or Y.</p></LI><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Sex-linked genes have unique patterns of inheritance (pp. 277-279,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 15.9</span>) The sex chromosomes carry certain genes for traits that are unrelated to maleness or femaleness. Hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder whose gene is on the X chromosome. In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is randomly inactivated during early embryonic development.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity15B:<span class="Emphasis1">

Such alterations can affect phenotype. Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, can arise when a normal gamete unites with one containing two copies or no copies of a particular chromosome as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis. Polyploidy, in which there are more than two complete sets of chromosomes, can result from complete nondisjunction during gamete formation. A variety of rearrangements can result from chromosome breakage. A lost fragment leaves one chromosome with a deletion and may produce a duplication, translocation, or inversion by reattaching to another chromosome. Such alterations cause a variety of human disorders, such as Down syndrome (usually due to trisomy of chromosome 21).</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity15C:<span class="Emphasis1">

Because the zygote’s cytoplasm comes from the ovum, certain features of the offspring’s phenotype depend solely on these maternal cytoplasmic genes. Some diseases affecting the nervous and muscular systems are caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA that prevent cells from making enough ATP.</p></LI></UL></table></body></html>
