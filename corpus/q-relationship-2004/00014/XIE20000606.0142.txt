ISLAMABAD , June 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Any additional sanctions on Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban militia will badly affect the ravaged country , a U.N. official said Tuesday .
`` More sanctions will have negative impact on extremely vulnerable Afghan population and will add to their difficulties , '' Syed Ahmed Farah , Acting U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan told a press conference here .
The United States Security Council slapped U.S. -sponsored economic and aviation sanctions on the Taliban , which controls over 80 percent of the country , late last year after the militia refused to hand in alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trail .
The most severe drought since 1971 all across Afghanistan has devastated the population who had been extremely vulnerable due to protracted civil war , the U.N. coordinator said .
