GENEVA , November 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The World Wide Fund for Nature -LRB- WWF -RRB- has called on Atlantic tuna fishing nations to honor their commitment to adopt a bona fide recovery plan for severely depleted bluefin tuna stocks .
The statement of the WWF , the conservation organization , came at a time when the members of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas -LRB- ICCAT -RRB- began their annual meeting Monday in Santiago de Compostela of Spain .
WWF said in a press release that the fishing nations had finally acknowledged that current regulations have failed to protect the endangered species , which has declined by more than 80 percent since 1975 .
Overfishing is the main cause of the bluefin tuna 's decline , WWF said , but rampant violations of ICCAT regulations -LRB- catching fish below legal size and exceeding established quotas -RRB- has further compounded the problem .
`` For years , ICCAT has neglected its responsibility to develop a bluefin tuna recovery plan , '' said Michael Sutton , Director of WWF 's Endangered Seas Campaign .
`` This year represents the best opportunity for fishing nations to take real action and adopt a plan that will restore bluefin tuna to its mid-1970 levels . ''
WWF said that the nations responsible for most of the bluefin catch in the Atlantic are Japan , the United States , Canada and Spain .
`` WWF expects these nations in particular to support an effective recovery plan , '' said Sutton .
`` If ICCAT fails to act , other international bodies such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species -LRB- CITES -RRB- may have to step in to save these fisheries . ''
