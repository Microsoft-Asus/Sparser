MOSCOW , March 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian federal forces continued their efforts Monday to destroy remaining Chechen rebels as fighting rages on in Komsomolskoye , where 46 rebels were killed overnight .
The fighters , led by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev , have been trying in vain to break out of the southern Chechen village for about two weeks .
One of the 46 killed rebels was an aide to the so-called Chechen foreign minister , said Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , the commander of Russian Interior Ministry troops .
Also on Monday , a Russian pilot , held by Chechen rebels after his Su -25 attack plane was shot down last October , was rescued by the Interior Ministry troops .
The pilot , identified as Alexander Zhukov , `` is alive and well , '' Tikhomirov said .
Federal aircraft and helicopters flew 71 sorties on Sunday against rebel positions in the Argun and Vedeno gorges and near the village of Alkhazurovo .
They reportedly destroyed 11 rebel strongholds , seven vehicles , one high-caliber machine gun , two mortars and a communications center , Interfax reported .
Meanwhile , Central Election Commission Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov flew to Chechnya Monday to oversee preparations for the Sunday presidential election in the republic , the Interfax news agency reported .
He will inspect several polling stations , some of them located with army units .
Early voting by the servicemen started last Friday , but local civilians will cast their votes on Sunday .
A group of international observers , led by Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights Gerard Stoudmann , also accompanied Veshnyakov , Interfax reported .
Elsewhere in Russia , officials are warning Russians of Chechen rebel threats to sabotage the Sunday voting .
`` Bandits may turn up in -LRB- neighboring -RRB- Daghestan or Stavropol territory or Ingushetia , '' said Colonel General Gennady Troshev , acting commander of the federal forces .
As much of Chechnya is now under federal control , some Russian troops have started pulling out of the breakaway republic .
The Russian army 's 331st air-borne division will leave Chechnya for its home base in Kostroma on Monday , air-borne forces commander Colonel General Geogy Shpak said .
However , 4,000 paratroops will remain in Chechnya even after the withdrawal , Shpak said .
