<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The state-controlled company that runs the Mir space station announced Friday it was selling shares to private investors to raise funds for Russia 's cash-strapped space program .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The RKK Energiya Corp. will sell 13 percent of its stock to help keep Mir in orbit .
The sale is expected to yield dlrs 100 million to dlrs 120 million , the Interfax news agency quoted space officials as saying .</ENAMEX>
Energiya built and has been running Mir since it was put in orbit in early 1986 .
After the Soviet collapse , the company was partly privatized , but the government retained a controlling interest .
The Russian space program 's cash shortage is so serious that officials even discussed abandoning Mir next month , about a year ahead of schedule .
Last month the government finally promised to pay the dlrs 600 million it owed for Mir 's 1997 operations , and space officials said they could keep the station in orbit until June 1999 .
They earlier planned to discard Mir in December 1999 .
