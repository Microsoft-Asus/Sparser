GUDERMES , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Rebels invaded a village deep in Russian -held western Chechnya on Saturday , while smaller clashes were reported throughout the breakaway republic and four Russian police were killed by a mine , the military said .
After a few days ' lull in large-scale battles , a group of rebels entered Samashki , near Chechnya 's border with the Russian republic of Ingushetia , Russian news reports said .
Russian troops were battling rebels , the military said .
A Defense Ministry spokesman in Moscow denied the rebels had gained any ground in Samashki .
He said Russian troops located a rebel band hiding in the woods outside the village Saturday and pounded them with artillery .
He would not comment on casualties or say how the rebels reached Samashki , which is deep in the area that Russian troops wrestled away from Chechen rebels last fall .
The raid highlighted the damage rebels can still inflict on Russian troops , even though the Russians have occupied most of Chechnya .
It also underscored the difficulty Russia will have trying to establish peace in the breakaway republic .
Saturday 's invasion came a day after Russian authorities effectively banned nonmilitary travel around Chechnya , saying they were worried about rebel attacks ahead of Sunday 's Russian presidential election .
Troops guarded polling stations around the republic .

Chechnya 's roads were deserted Saturday , but the violence seemed to be worsening .
Four Russian police were killed when their truck hit a mine near Argun , east of the capital , Grozny , the Defense Ministry said .
Rebels fired at a Russian military post in Argun , drawing federal troops into a protracted battle , the Interfax news agency reported , citing military sources .
There was no word on casualties .
Within the last day , rebels had fired grenades at interior troops in Grozny , attacked a special unit in the northern village of Naurskaya and fired at police checkpoints in and around three other towns , the Interior Ministry press center said Saturday .
Meanwhile , in the main arena of the military action , Russian troops battled rebels in the southern mountain districts of Sharoi , Vedeno and Nozhai - Yurt , the Interior Ministry said .
Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 50 missions over the past 24 hours , attacking rebel groups in the Argun gorge and the nearby villages of Bamut , Khatuni and Sharo - Argun , the military command told Interfax .
The command said the strikes wiped out nine rebel strongholds in the mountains .
The claim could not be confirmed .
Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September , after rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last summer .
The military swept across the plains in the north quickly but has been stalled for several weeks at the foothills of the mountains that cut across southern Chechnya .
