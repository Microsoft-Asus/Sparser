-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A decision on which pipeline route to use for transporting the bulk of Azerbaijan 's Caspian Sea oil to the West has been postponed until at least next month , a news report said Wednesday .
Azerbaijani officials earlier said they expected to make a decision in October .
But President Geidar Aliev said Wednesday that an international oil consortium would make its pipeline recommendation to the government Nov. 12 , the Interfax news agency reported .
Aliev will make the final announcement on the route , but is almost certain to take the consortium 's recommendation .
Aliev favors a proposed pipeline through Georgia and Turkey .
Several U.S. oil companies have invested heavily in the project , and the United States also favors the Georgia - Turkey route .
Richard Morningstar , U.S. envoy to Caspian energy development , said Wednesday in Ankara that the postponement of the pipeline decision was a good sign for the Georgia - Turkey route .
`` Negotiations have taken on a very serious tone over the past few weeks . ...
I see that as a very positive sign , that the reason for that delay is because the negotiations are taking place . ''
A smaller pipeline to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia is expected to start pumping oil in April .
Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the Middle East , but they remain relatively untapped because countries with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive projects off the ground .
