GENEVA
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The U.N. refugee agency said Monday it has scaled down operations along the Guinea - Liberia border in West Africa because of fighting that left one worker dead and another missing .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stopped work in the Guinean town of Macenta since the head of its mission , Mensah Kpognon , 50 , was killed Sunday by gunmen at his home .
Another staffer , Sapeu Laurence Djeya , was kidnapped during the unrest .
`` There is still fighting in the area , '' said UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond .
Nonessential UNHCR personnel were to remain in their homes and all dependents of international staff were being taken to Conakry , the capital of Guinea , Redmond said .
Guinea hosts more than 460,000 refugees , one of the largest refugee populations in Africa .
About 330,000 are from Sierra Leone and 126,000 from Liberia .
Because of security concerns , UNHCR operations -- and those of other agencies and charities -- may be scaled back , Redmond said .
The main impact of the cutback would be on 10,000 Liberians who crossed into Guinea about a year ago , said Kris Janowski , another UNCHR spokesman .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Liberians are dependent on the agency for food and would probably start running out of supplies only after several weeks , Janowski said .
The remaining 108,000 refugees in the area have been there longer and have their own garden plots to supply food</ENAMEX> .
The agency 's main service to them is to make sure authorities do n't force them back into Liberia , where they are perceived as opposition to the government .
`` They might be in trouble , '' Janowski said .
A still greater concern would be if the pullback spreads westward , where the agency is caring for 300,000 refugees from Sierra Leone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Liberia has accused Guinea of harboring rebels who crossed into northern Liberia in July and have been fighting government forces there ever since .
Most of the refugees in the Macenta area are Liberian , but some Sierra Leonean refugees have fled into the area recently following attacks by Sierra Leonean rebels .</ENAMEX>
Sunday 's attack at the U.N. worker 's home came less than two weeks after three UNHCR staff members were killed by pro- Indonesia militiamen in a West Timor office of the agency .
`` Why are innocent , unarmed humanitarians like Mensah Kpognon , a father of four children who was simply trying to make the world a better place , being struck down in the most brutal way ? '' asked U.N. High Commissioner Sadako Ogata , who was in Herat , Afghanistan , when word came of the latest attack .
The U.N. agency renewed its appeal for international help in finding and freeing Djeya .
Redmond said UNHCR had contacted all governments in the area , particularly Liberia , because Djeya was last seen being taken by her abductors toward Liberia .
She was in Macenta after delivering supplies from the UNHCR office in Danane , Ivory Coast .
There was no indication that the staff in Macenta had been targeted because they worked for the agency , UNHCR said .
Many other buildings in the town were burned as the assailants were retreating from Macenta following a pre-dawn raid on the town 's military garrison , said UNHCR .
An unspecified number of Guineans were also killed in Sunday 's raid , UNHCR said .
