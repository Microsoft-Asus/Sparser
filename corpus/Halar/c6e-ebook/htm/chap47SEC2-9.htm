This sort of complete cell lineage has not been determined for other animals, but biologists have been making more general territorial diagrams of embryonic development, called <span class="Emphasis2">fate maps,</span> for over 70 years. Classic studies performed in the 1920s by German embryologist W. Vogt established that in embryos whose axes are defined early in development, it is often possible to ascertain which parts of the embryo will be derived from each region of the zygote or blastula. Following the lead of earlier work on marine worms and mollusks, Vogt charted fate maps for amphibian embryos (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.20a</span>). Using nontoxic dyes, he labeled cells of different regions of the surface of amphibian blastulas with different colors and later sectioned the embryos to see where the colors turned up. Vogt’s results were among the earliest indications that the lineage (the "genealogy") of cells making up the three germ layers created by gastrulation is traceable to cells in the blastula (compare <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 47.20a</span> and <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 47.10</span>). Later researchers developed more sophisticated techniques that allowed them to mark an individual blastomere during cleavage and then follow the marker as it was distributed to all the mitotic descendants of that cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.20b</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig47-20','../fig/big/fig47-20.jpg','fig47-20');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig47-20.jpg" alt="fig47-20" name="myfig47-20"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 47-20.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Fate maps for two chordates.

The drawings depict 64-cell embryos of a tunicate, an invertebrate chordate. An individual cell can be injected with a dye, enabling a researcher to determine which cells in a later embryo are derived from the marked cells. The two light micrographs of larvae contrast the regions that develop from the two different blastomeres indicated in the drawings.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Developmental biologists have combined fate-mapping studies with experimental manipulation of parts of embryos in which they study whether a cell’s fate can be changed by moving it elsewhere in the embryo. Two important conclusions have emerged. First, in most animals, certain early "founder cells" generate specific tissues of the older embryo. Second, as development proceeds, a cell’s <span class="Emphasis1">developmental potential</span>--the range of structures that it can give rise to--becomes restricted. Starting with the normal embryo’s fate map, researchers can examine how the differentiation of cells is altered in experimental situations or in mutant embryos.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
