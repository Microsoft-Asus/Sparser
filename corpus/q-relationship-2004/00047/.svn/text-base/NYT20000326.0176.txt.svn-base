VIENNA , Austria --
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is on the verge of an agreement to increase its oil production limits by about 1.7 million barrels a day , officials from several oil exporting countries said Sunday .
Although the exact numbers are still being debated and the increase is less than the 2.5 million barrels sought by a Clinton administration worried about the ramifications of high gasoline prices , the increase is somewhat larger than many analysts had expected .
It could reduce the price of oil by several dollars a barrel , but exactly when and whether that gets passed on to the consumer remains unclear .
One senior OPEC official said the increase would almost exactly reverse the production cuts the cartel agreed upon one year ago , which sent oil prices soaring and ignited a political uproar in the United States as U.S. gasoline prices surged to more than $ 1.60 a gallon in many cities .
`` We believe this number will result in bringing back market stability , '' the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
`` It is a reasonable increase , a very reasonable increase to make sure there are reasonable stocks in the second quarter . ''
Asked if there was much uncertainty about the final outcome when OPEC oil ministers meet here on Monday , the official firmly shook his head .
The oil ministers are also expected to announce plans for a follow-up meeting in June at which they could choose to raise production levels again if the price stays near $ 30 a barrel .
Saudi officials want to get the price down to about $ 25 a barrel .
Iran , OPEC 's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia , is among several countries still opposed to such a big boost in production .
But other OPEC officials predicted that they would agree on an increase of at least 1.5 million barrels a day -- but more likely 1.7 million -- levels that have been urged particularly by the Saudis .
`` What is being discussed is a return of the 1.7 million barrels that were removed from production last year , '' Kuwait 's oil minister , Sheik Saud Nasser al- Sabah , said in an interview here Sunday night .
Although he described an increase in production as a move driven by politics rather than economics , he predicted a boost would be agreed at or close to the levels sought by Saudi Arabia .
He also said oil prices were likely to fall .
`` The market will look at this as an increase , and will react by reducing prices , '' the Kuwaiti minister predicted .
The recent surge in gasoline prices has become a major election-year topic in the United States .
Lawmakers in Congress have lambasted OPEC countries in recent weeks and accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of paying no heed to the United States ' role in rescuing Kuwait from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
George W. Bush , the likely Republican presidential nominee , has called for a big reduction in gasoline taxes .
Vice President Al Gore , the expected Democratic nominee , has been peppered with complaints and the Clinton administration waged an intense lobbying campaign to persuade OPEC countries about a big increase in production .
Oil ministers from the 11 nations in OPEC will meet here on Monday to formally discuss the plan .
But the countries have already been talking for weeks and have held intensive meetings here in the last few days .
Analysts cautioned that the expected increase will probably have only a modest impact on gasoline prices , probably no more than 10 cents a gallon .
Nonetheless , said Gary N. Ross , president of PIRA Energy Group , an oil industry consulting firm , the increases would have a tangible impact and coincide with unexpectedly weak demand for oil in the first months of this year .
`` They have made it clear they want to see lower prices , '' Ross said , referring to the Saudis .
`` They want to get oil out of the newspaper headlines . ''
The last two years have shown that oil prices are notoriously difficult to predict , for OPEC or for anybody else .
Few analysts , if any , expected prices to plunge as low as $ 11 a barrel one year ago , just as few if any predicted their abrupt surge to about $ 28 a barrel today .
Peter Ginoux , head of the oil trading desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London , said increasing OPEC 's quota by 1.7 million barrels is inherently less than it appears .
That is because OPEC nations are already cheating on their own restrictions , overshooting their official limit of 23 million barrels a day by about 1 million barrels .
To the extent that any official increase simply substitutes for the unofficial cheating , the real increase could be as little as 1 million barrels a day .
And though cheating could continue at nearly the present pace , many smaller OPEC producers are already producing at nearly their current capacity .
`` Noncompliance can only come now from the big guys , and they are the ones who are charged with keeping prices up , '' Ginoux said Sunday .
`` If we take the net new supply to be 1 million barrels a day , I am horribly afraid that this will go to restocking -- and probably keep prices right where they are . ''
Within OPEC , the view is considerably different .
Iran has argued loudly that OPEC should not raise production by more than about 700,000 or one million barrels a day .
And even pro- Western countries like Kuwait are worried about a repeat of the catastrophic decline in prices that occurred after OPEC raised production modestly in September 1997 .
`` I am worried , '' said al- Sabah .
`` The market has already dropped by $ 5 a barrel .
I do n't see any compelling reason to increase production other than to be political , to be quite honest . ''
In reality , the total increase in production extends beyond the official OPEC quotas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Mexico , Norway and Oman , who are not members of the oil cartel , all joined in with OPEC last year , slashing their combined production by about 400,000 barrels a day</ENAMEX> .
Mexican officials have already said they plan to raise their output by as much as 300,000 barrels .
Norway said it will decide the issue after OPEC meets , but it will probably go back to its earlier levels as well .
On top of that there is Iraq , which is part of OPEC but is allowed to pump at maximum levels under a system regulated by the U.N. sanctions program installed after the Persian Gulf War .
Iraq slashed its production to about 700,000 barrels a day last year , complaining that it could n't get the parts it needed .
But after conciliatory moves by the United Nations , Iraq announced this week that it will go back to full production in the next few months .
U.S. officials refused to comment Sunday night on OPEC 's likely production increases , saying it would be premature .
But although the increases are less than those advocated by Bill Richardson , the secretary of energy , the Clinton administration is likely to express relief .
At the same time , many OPEC countries that have good relations with the United States are angry at what they see as the Americans ' heavy-handed pressure in recent weeks .
`` It is strange that the champion of the free market economy is acting in a way that would put Marxists to shame , '' the daily Saudi Gazette said in an editorial on threats by Congress to impose sanctions if OPEC does not raise production .
The editorial denounced the effort as `` an atrocious proposal which violates the norms of the market and defies common sense . ''
