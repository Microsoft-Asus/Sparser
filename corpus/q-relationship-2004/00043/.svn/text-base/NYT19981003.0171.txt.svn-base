AUSTIN --
Warning that Texas faces a growing threat from organized crime gangs , a special Senate committee is poised to recommend creation of a statewide Violent Gang Task Force to better coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts .
In a report expected to be made public today , a five-member Texas Senate committee that has been studying gangs and juvenile justice issues will recommend the task force be made up of representatives from the prison system , police agencies and prosecutors -- to better coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts .
Other recommendations include creation of a statewide computer network to track gang members , stricter parole rules for imprisoned gang members and a new 211 telephone help line for parents , teachers and police .
The 116-page report , obtained Wednesday by the American - Statesman , represents the most comprehensive look at the growing gang-crime problem that the Legislature has undertaken in several years .
It also is a first step in what legislative leaders have said they expect will be several new laws to crack down on teen-aged street gangs and gang members in prisons when lawmakers convene in January .
In recommending the statewide computer database on gang members , the report suggests police agencies across Texas should consider standardizing gang data .
It also suggests the Legislature consider whether parents should be notified when their children are designated as gang members , whether files on juveniles should be purged as they grow older and stay out of trouble and whether access to the gang database should be limited because of constitutional privacy issues .
Creation of a special three-digit phone number , patterned after Atlanta 's successful 211 system , would allow parents , police , teachers and others to quickly and easily access information about gang intervention , counseling and assistance programs .
The projected cost : $ 574,000 a year .
In all , the recommendations could carry a pricetag of more than $ 49 million .
More than $ 41 million of that is expected to be sought by the Texas Youth Commission to expand juvenile lockups .
The state 's current two-year budget is about $ 87 billion .
Other recommendations : --Require the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin noting on its computer files whether a crime was gang-related or a criminal is a confirmed member of a prison gang , a move that could help improve safety for street cops .
--Require parole officials to more closely supervise gang members who are released from prison , including tougher restrictions on their movements and whom they associate with .
Parole officials said Wednesday they already are working on such new rules .
--Require the Texas Education Agency , local public school officials and Prairie View A&M University 's Juvenile Crime Prevention Institute to better train school personnel to identify and report gang membership and gang behavior .
-Bolster with additional money existing state programs for at-risk youths , as a way to thwart what has become prison gangs ' biggest pool of new recruits .
State Sen. Royce West , a Dallas Democrat who heads the special committee , did not return a phone call for comment Wednesday .
But in a letter to Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock accompanying the report , West urged `` a stronger commitment to prevention and intervention services for our youth . ''
`` The key to reducing juvenile delinquency lies in providing at-risk youth with healthy alternatives such as after-school and weekend programs , as well as offering more prevention and intervention services for those children who show a need . ''
Estimating there could be more than 145,000 gang members in Texas -- at least 5,000 of those in prisons -- the report says most are members of teen-aged street gangs .
But those in spray-painting and vandalism gangs , who police say are increasingly working with the more violent prison gangs , are part of a growing crime problem all across Texas .
In all , the report estimates Texas has 3,276 active youth gangs -- second only to California .
But despite the growth in numbers of gang members , police in several major Texas cities estimate gang-related crimes have dropped in the past two years -- 28 percent in Austin alone .
The reason , police say , is that more gang members are being arrested and sent to prison at the same time as gangs are refining the way they do business -- becoming more selective , oftentimes more violent , in the types of crimes their members are involved in .
