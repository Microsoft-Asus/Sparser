UNITED NATIONS , October 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo Friday called for NATO intervention in Kosovo and said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should be held responsible for genocide and investigating for war crimes .
Addressing the 53rd General Assembly session , Milo said that immediate NATO action is necessary `` because of the failure of the peaceful means applied by the international community so far . ''
`` It is high time for the U.N. and other international organizations to urgently intervene for the restoration of peace , otherwise we risk to have another wider conflict , '' he said .
Meanwhile , the Albanian foreign minister accused Milosevic of ordering `` the implementation of his ethnic cleansing policy against Albanians under the pretext of combating the so-called Albanian terrorism . ''
Thousands of Kosovo Albanians have fled to Albania and thousands more were wandering Kosovo 's forests and mountains , creating an acute humanitarian crisis , he said .
Last week , Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told a press conference here that Albania has provided arms , finance and training for the terrorists in Kosovo .
The United Nations Security Council Thursday condemned recent massacres of civilians in Kosovo , Serbian 's province of mainly ethnic Albanians , but the council did not assign blame and added no new legal backing for any NATO action .
In his speech , Milo accused Serbian propaganda of trying to justify indiscriminate attacks and the massacre of ethnic Albanians -- just as it did in Bosnia -- by making false accusations of terrorist activity .
The foreign minister told a press conference that he is `` not satisfied with '' the latest U.N. resolution .
`` I want it to be much stronger , '' he added .
`` It is just the right time for the international community to send a stronger message to President Milosevic '' that the world will no longer tolerate his mass shooting of civilians , he said .
However , Belgrade has said that it has nothing to do with the alleged massacre .
Milo insists that his government wants a peaceful end to the Kosovo conflict .
`` We are in favor of an immediate end of the conflict and the initiation of the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina , with an international involvement as a third party , '' he said .
`` This would guarantee their success .
The negotiations should define the future status of Kosovo . ''
The Albanian government believes a solution `` should take into consideration the request of the will of the Albanians to self-determination and respect for the international conventions which reject the violent changing of borders , '' he added .
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo 's population of 2 million , and they have been seeking independence by fighting Serbs in the southernmost province of Serbia , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
