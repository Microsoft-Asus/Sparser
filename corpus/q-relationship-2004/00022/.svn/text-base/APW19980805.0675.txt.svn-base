Refugees would be transferred to the town of Sinje , 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away from Monrovia where the UNHCR already has a large operation .

-- KAMPALA , Uganda -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh , the only brother of President Yoweri Museveni , has turned down a Cabinet -level post , saying the appointment might be interpreted as nepotism , a newspaper said Wednesday .
`` Given the mentality of our society , people will view my ministerial appointment as nepotism because of blood relationship I have with the president , '' the government-owned New Vision quoted Saleh as telling Museveni .
The newspaper reported unidentified sources as saying Saleh was also of the opinion most Ugandans prefer cabinet ministers who have high academic qualifications , which he lacks .
Saleh , whose real name is Caleb Akandwanaho , fought alongside Museveni in his five-year bush war which brought his brother to power in early 1986 .
Last week , Museveni named Saleh , whose previous job had been described as `` overseer in the defense ministry , '' to an unspecified Cabinet post .
He also named another unspecified Cabinet official and 14 junior officials .
Parliament initially opposed the appointments on the grounds the cabinet was already too big and those named were unrepresentative .
Museveni later convinced the legislators to change their minds .
