Soldiers from China 's People 's Liberation Army left Hong Kong Friday after completing their terms and returned to their hometowns , a statement from the PLA 's Hong Kong office said Saturday .
They will be replaced at the end of the month , a PLA spokesman who gave his name only as Luo said .
He said the number of troops who left could not be disclosed for security reasons .
The troops who left had completed their terms according to the People 's Republic of China Military Service Law , the statement said .
About 4,700 Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since the territory was returned to Chinese rule in July 1997 .
With the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 still in their memories , many Hong Kong people were wary of their arrival .
Apart from their march into the territory hours after the handover , the troops have since stayed largely out of sight .
Thousands of local citizens have attended a handful of open houses at PLA quarters since the handover .
