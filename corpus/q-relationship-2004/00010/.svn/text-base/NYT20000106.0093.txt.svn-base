There are an estimated 6 million Muslims in the United States , and the vast majority of them lead lives of peace and moderation .
Like traditional Muslims the world over , most American Muslims shun violence and place great emphasis on virtue , charity , and religious tolerance .
Which is why it is so dismaying that American Muslims are rarely heard to raise their voices against the terrorists and fanatics who are ruining Islam 's reputation .
Suppose that on Christmas Eve a group of Catholic militants had hijacked an airliner and taken its 155 passengers and crew members hostage .
Suppose they murdered one of the hostages in cold blood , then demanded the release of several radical priests who had been imprisoned for crimes committed as members of terrorist organizations .
If thugs claiming to act as devout Catholics ever did such things , the loudest cries of outrage in the United States would come from American Catholics .
From the cardinals on down , the Catholic community would recoil in shock and disgust .
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops would issue a statement explicitly denouncing the terrorists .
No one would be left with the impression that decent Catholics turn a blind eye to violence carried out in the name of Catholicism .
But when a group of Islamic fanatics , reportedly from the Harkat -ul- Mujahideen terrorist group that wants Kashmir brought under Muslim control , hijacked an Indian plane and killed a passenger , America 's Muslim leadership was largely silent .
There was no outpouring of condemnation from the mosques .
Prominent Muslim organizations did n't call press conferences to blast the hijackers for disgracing Islam .
Once again Americans saw an occurrence of Islamic fundamentalist terror , and once again they heard scarcely any word of sorrow or revulsion from America 's Muslim spokesmen .
Are the spokesmen the problem ?
Among the best-known Islamic organizations in the United States are the American Muslim Council , the Council on American - Islamic Relations , and the Muslim Public Affairs Council .
Although each sometimes functions as a straightforward clearinghouse for Muslim information and advocacy , they are also swift to attack anyone who is critical of Islamic extremism -- even when the `` criticism '' is mere reporting .
For example , when the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in 1998 by agents of Osama bin Laden , these groups did not cry out against the terrorists or express horror that 224 victims could have been murdered by people claiming to be Muslims .
Rather , they seized the moment to lecture the media not to stereotype Islam .
The Muslim Public Affairs Council issued a dry caution against `` tagging terrorism with a religious label '' and pointed out that `` some of the rescue workers ... were Muslim . ''
It has yet to acknowledge that bin Laden is a terrorist .
The FBI 's recent arrest of two alleged members of the Armed Islamic Group , an exceptionally brutal terror group based in Algeria , evoked a similar reaction .
The American Muslim Council released a statement condemning terrorism `` by any individual or group of any faith '' -- but not actually mentioning the Armed Islamic Group or its horrifying record of bloodshed .
Once you notice the pattern , you see it repeatedly .
MPAC , CAIR , and the AMC readily declare that `` terrorism has no place in Islam , '' -LRB- as an AMC press release put it last week -RRB- , but they never attack specific Islamic terrorist or radical groups .
That is a clue to their real agenda .
Speaking at a State Department forum last January , Shaykh Hisham Kabbani , leader of the Sufi -inspired Islamic Supreme Council of America , said : `` How can you know a moderate Muslim from non-moderate ?
One who denounces extremism . ''
It is an obvious litmus test .
In Kabbani 's view , the selective indignation of organizations like the AMC is no accident .
`` There are many Muslim organizations that claim to speak on behalf of the Muslim community , '' he warned .
`` But they in reality are not moderate , but extremist .
They hijacked the mike ... but they give a wrong idea about Islam . ''
Kabbani is alarmed by the inroads the Islamic extremists have made .
But that is a problem that `` can be solved if the West better understands Islam and builds bridges with the moderate Muslims , the traditional Muslims .
This way , the Muslim community will eliminate the extremist threat from within . ''
Islamic extremists -- some scholars use the term `` Islamists , '' to distinguish the radicals from traditional Muslims -- are skilled at victim politics and media intimidation .
They pounce on any criticism of Islamic militants with charges of bigotry and `` Islamophobia . ''
As a result , the media shy away from candid discussions of Islam ; when they do venture into Muslim issues , they allow themselves to be guided by the polished Islamists .
Rarely do Americans get to hear from traditional Muslim moderates , even though theirs is the authentic voice of Islam .
Kabbani 's Islamic Supreme Council is one example of a traditional Muslim organization , deeply committed to peace and moderation , that deserves to be better known .
The Association of Islamic Charitable Projects , a leading sponsor of Muslim schools and youth programs , is another .
They are not obsessed with politics and press coverage ; it is not their way to seek out the media .
All the more reason , then , for the media to start seeking them .
