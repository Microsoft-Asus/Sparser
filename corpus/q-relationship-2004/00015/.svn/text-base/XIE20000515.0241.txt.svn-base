Mulla Abdul Amid Akhundzada , Taliban 's senior official responsible for drug control , Monday confirmed that the militia had agreed with Pakistan and Iran on a joint operation to wipe out the refining laboratories in the border area in the far south of the country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` We are cracking down heavily on poppy farms and we will continue to do so , '' said Akhundzada at Kandahar , Taliban 's headquarters in southern Afghanistan .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Afghanistan is a leading poppy producer in the world whose opium harvest , a United Nations estimate shows , was about a record 4,600 tons in 1999 .</ENAMEX>
Akhundzada said the time it took to eradicate drug farms would depend on the level of international funding , without specifying a precise figure .
He added an estimated 1.6 billion U.S.dollars is needed for the work .
`` The more the international effort , the quicker the crackdown , '' said the official , despite some reports saying that the Taliban militia have been levying 10 percent tax on poppy harvest in the area they control .
Akhundzada admitted that the southern desert in the province of Helmand , which accounts for 45 percent of Afghan opium production , contains several laboratories which transform opium into morphine .
`` It 's a fact that that exists , '' he said .
`` We want to dismantle these laboratories but for that we need the cooperation of Iran and Pakistan . ''
