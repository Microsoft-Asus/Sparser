Indeed, we learn to distinguish between the kinds of plants or animals--between dogs and cats, for instance--from differences in their appearance. In addition to comparing morphology (body form), modern taxonomists also consider differences in body functions, biochemistry, behavior, and genetic makeup. However, dividing organisms into different species based on comparative data is only part of an extensive effort to better understand the nature of species and the factors that maintain their distinctiveness in nature.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
