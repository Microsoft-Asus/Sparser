It was a bit like the old joke about the dog that chases cars : Once he catches one , what does he do then ?
After an audaciously heroic pledge by President Kennedy to send a man to the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration achieved the goal in spectacular fashion -- just 30 years ago tomorrow -LRB- July 20 -RRB- .
But then what ?
NASA had its plans , to be sure : An orbiting space station , serviced by a fleet of shuttles , used as a staging area for the next great project -- establishing a human presence on Mars by 1984 .
But President Nixon put the kibosh on the continuation of the Kennedy -initiated program .
The only part of the plan implemented , albeit over budget and far behind schedule , was the fleet of shuttles -- without a place to go or a clearly defined goal .
The ruddy soil of Mars is as far from being trampled by human feet today as it was in 1969 .
Not that NASA has been standing still .
The last three decades have seen a series of triumphs in the robotic exploration of the solar system , transforming what was virtually a blank canvas at the time of Apollo 11 into a series of real worlds , mapped , photographed and probed in extraordinary -- and often dazzlingly beautiful -- detail .
And orbiting observatories , most notably the Hubble Space Telescope , have opened the universe with a clarity astronomers of the past could only dream of .
But many scientists complain that the space program 's budget-gobbling emphasis on operating the space shuttle and developing the new International Space Station -- NASA 's primary focus for more than a decade now -- has sapped resources that could have been better spent on a much grander program of unpiloted exploration .
And some engineers and space entrepreneurs complain that NASA 's policies and pronouncements have thwarted , rather than aided , the development of low-cost rockets that could truly open the space frontier to widespread commercial development , even tourism .
The space program still earns great public admiration , but the agency responsible for it seems perpetually under fire .
And both the people working within NASA and the critics sniping at it seem to share a profound nostalgia for Apollo 's glory days .
Then , `` we were able to take risks because we were in a race with the Russians , '' said Peter Diamandis , chairman of the X - Prize foundation , which aims to spur private companies to develop low-cost rockets by offering a $ 10 million prize to the first company to send three people into space , and then do it again within two weeks in the same rocket .
What is lacking today , Diamandis said , `` is a pervasive single vision , with the political will and ability to make it happen . ''
But most analysts agree that the cold war space-race mentality that fueled the urgency of the moon program will never happen again .
NASA `` started out with a very specific task : Catch up with the Russians , '' said Laurence Young , Apollo professor of astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Its success `` gave us a sense that no problem was too difficult to work on . ''
But since Apollo , things have not progressed the way many people had hoped .
`` Thirty years after the Wright brothers , anybody who flew in the air was generally a paying customer , '' said Tim Kyger , a spokesman for Universal Space Lines , a company that hopes to operate a commercial fleet of spaceliners and someday take paying tourists into space .
-LRB- Former Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad , who died 10 days ago , was the founder and president of the company . -RRB-
`` It 's 30 years after Apollo , '' Kyger said , `` and you still ca n't buy a ticket to orbit . ''
But several startup companies aim to remedy that if they can raise the necessary capital .
Their common vision , manifested in a variety of designs , is to produce a totally reusable rocket , bringing greater economy to a business in which rockets are always thrown away , in whole or in part , after every launch .
NASA , recognizing it is dependent on rockets that were designed at least a quarter-century ago , is also eager to see a new generation of launch vehicles take off .
And Congress is in the midst of heated debate over a bill designed to foster development of such alternative rockets through direct financial support .
`` At NASA , we have made the commitment to help improve access to space -- it is our numer one new development priority , '' said NASA chief Daniel Goldin in a recent meeting with leaders of space-oriented businesses .
`` Our goal is to reduce the payload cost to low- Earth orbit by an order of magnitude within ten years to $ 1,000 per pound , and to $ 100 per pound within 20 years . ''
Many space advocates heartily endorse those goals , but blanch at the timetable .
Several companies working on the development of reusable rockets think they can achieve a tenfold cost reduction in just a few years -- if investors will put up the needed money , which could total several hundred million dollars .
`` It 's never been about technology , '' said Diamandis , referring to the difficulties facing the startup companies .
`` The roadblocks so far have been financial and regulatory . ''
One company , Kistler Aerospace , has raised more than $ 450 million ; another , Rotary Rocket , has acquired over $ 30 million ; and a third , Pioneer Rocketplane , is close to signing a lucrative deal with the state of Utah .
But all need much more money to proceed .
Kistler hopes to fly its first rocket by year 's end , and Rotary expects to launch next year .
Some of the companies and their advocates are troubled by the proposed new space legislation and by some recent comments from NASA 's Goldin about the extraordinary cost and time-consuming nature of developing single-stage rockets , which they say could frighten away potential investors .
Meanwhile , the legislation as presently drafted would do more to help giant aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin , increasing the improbability that startup ventures can compete .
`` Until recently , '' said Kyger , NASA had been `` at best , slightly supportive , or at the least , benignly neglectful .
But now , they 've been making negative statements that have chilled the market . ...
-LRB- They have been -RRB- stomping on people , deliberately or not . ''
Goldin , in a series of written answers to questions posed by the Globe , countered that `` I am a strong advocate of lower cost space transportation ...
NASA must pursue the goal of reducing the launch costs aggressively , while doing everything it can to assist the emerging rocket companies with their mission of cheap access to space . ''
Toward that end , Goldin said NASA is considering providing help in the form of loan guarantees , advance contracts for launch services , or direct support for research .
And far from being pessimistic about these companies ' prospects , Goldin added that `` I am confident that their work will boost competition and provide new alternatives for access to space . ''
Within NASA itself , there is debate about how best to address future launch needs .
Some advocate keeping the shuttle as NASA 's primary vehicle for another two or three decades .
Others see hope in the proposed reusable VentureStar rocket , whose smaller-scale test version , called the X -33 , is being developed by Lockheed Martin under a NASA contract , but which would cost at least $ 6 billion more to develop into a usable version .
A third option -- developing a small piloted craft that could be launched atop any of a variety of either expendable or reusable rockets -- may be the most benign course , the advocates say , because it would not compete directly with the proposed reusable rockets for such tasks as launching the expected constellations of new low-orbit communications satellites .
These are being designed for global cellular phones and wireless high-speed Internet links , and may require dozens of launches per year -- a potentially very lucrative market .
There is a significant window of opportunity for the new breed of rockets .
That 's because NASA 's attention , much of its budget , and most of its shuttle launches will be directed for the next few years toward the construction and servicing of the International Space Station .
That leaves most other space activities up to the commercial sector , whose revenues from space activities already exceed all government spending on the space program .
The space station itself likely would never have survived its protracted funding battles in Congress , if it had n't been justified by the need to provide a significant joint program with Russia to help support their struggling space program .
But while its justification was geopolitical , its function will be almost entirely scientific .
As such , it stands as a tangible symbol of the two major focuses of the nation 's present space program : science and international cooperation .
`` We will see growing international cooperation in scientific research , '' NASA 's Goldin told the Globe , `` but we will also see new growth in a competitive commercial sector that will further open the space frontier . ''
In the glory days of Apollo , says MIT 's Young , `` science was number 2 or 3 .
If we learned something scientific about the moon , that was a byproduct . ''
But things have changed dramatically : Now , he says , `` NASA has become a servant of the scientific and commercial sector in space ... .
They have become the enablers . ''
In the meantime , on the very anniversary of NASA 's crowning moment , the agency will be launching a space shuttle mission that perhaps symbolizes the new NASA of today .
It is a purely scientific mission : a new `` great observatory '' to join the hugely successful Hubble Space Telescope .
It 's also the first shuttle flight commanded by a woman .
Poised for launch just a little after midnight tonight -LRB- July 20 -RRB- , the Chandra X -ray observatory , unlike past projects , was designed and managed by scientists and engineers from academic institutions , chiefly the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard University , and will be controlled entirely from a new center in Cambridge 's Kendall Square .
NASA , though paying the bills , will have little direct involvement .
That 's a positive step , many analysts say .
But it 's not enough .
There is still no clear focus , no goal that the agency 's efforts are directed toward as they were with Apollo .
Human missions to Mars could be developed for no more money than what NASA has saved in recent years by doing things more efficiently , said Robert Zubrin , president of Pioneer Astronautics and author of `` The Case for Mars . ''
It would take only about 20 percent more than is being spent now with no clear goal .
`` Having them do nothing , '' he said , `` is almost as expensive as having them storm heaven . ''
