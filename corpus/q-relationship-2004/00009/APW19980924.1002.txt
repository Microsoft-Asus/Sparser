Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma met Thursday with Azerbaijan 's first deputy premier , Abbas Abbasov , to discuss Ukrainian plans to transport Azerbaijan 's Caspian Sea oil , Kuchma 's press service said .
Ukrainian officials said the sides focused on a planned visit of a group of experts from Azerbaijan , who are scheduled to arrive on Oct. 8 to look at Ukraine 's Odessa oil terminal and the Odessa - Brody pipeline , both now under construction .
Ukraine , along with Russia , Turkey , Georgia and Iran , is eager to take part in the lucrative transportation of oil from Azerbaijan 's huge Caspian Sea deposits .
The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to Odessa on the Black Sea , and from there via a pipeline to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export .
In talks with Azerbaijan , Ukrainian officials repeatedly have argued that although this route could not be exclusive , it offered the shortest way to northern Europe , providing for lower transportation costs than other planned routes .
According to Ukraine 's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko , the country would be ready to start transporting Caspian oil in two years .
Holubchenko says Ukraine would need about dlrs 400 million to complete the half-finished Odessa - Brody pipeline .
