TOKYO --
South Korean military commanders put troops on the country 's eastern coast on alert Sunday and declared a curfew in the area after finding the body of a diver who they said was a North Korean commando .
The diver , whose body apparently washed up on the beach , was carrying a Czech -made submachine gun , a hand grenade , radio transmission gear and an underwater camera , the military said .
Nearby , investigators found a cone-shaped aluminum submersible boat that could carry up to five commandos .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` Judging from the objects found , it has been proven that the dead diver was an armed infiltrator , '' said Kang Jung -kwon , a Defense Ministry spokesman .
If further investigation backs that up -- and if other armed North Korean infiltrators are caught -- a result could be serious new antagonisms between North and South Korea .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">More broadly , the incursion could be a major setback for efforts to engage the Stalinist state in the North and bring it out of its isolation .
South Korea President Kim Dae -jung has pushed a `` sunshine '' policy intended to build ties with the North and ease sanctions against it .
But that is proving difficult to promote because of evidence that North Korea is still sending armed commandos into the South .</ENAMEX>
Just last month , a furor erupted when a South Korean fisherman caught a North Korean submarine in his drift net .
The North Korean commandos on board apparently killed the crew and then themselves , but South Korean officials said that some of the commandos had recently been on South Korean soil .
That incident aroused only limited outrage in the South Korea , in part because the submarine was 12 miles offshore when it was caught in the net .
North Korea said it had lost power and suggested that it had drifted south .
A much more serious episode occurred when a North Korean submarine ran aground on the South Korean coast in October 1996 and 19 crew members and commandos slipped ashore .
Some 70,000 South Korean troops were deployed to hunt them down , and in the end all the North Koreans were killed or committed suicide except one who was captured and another who was never found .
That incident nearly destroyed efforts to promote peace on the Korean peninsula , and it also led to strains in relations between South Korea and the United States as officials argued about how to handle the crisis .
The body discovered Sunday morning was found by a South Korean man walking along the beach near the city of Donghae , 110 miles northeast of Seoul .
The dead diver was wearing a wet suit , goggles and two oxygen tanks .
Defense Ministry doctors examined the body and said that the man had died of a heart attack and had been dead between 24 and 48 hours .
North Korea had no immediate comment on the discovery of the diver .
In the past it has denied that it engages in armed infiltration .
Some overseas Koreans sympathetic to the North have said that infiltrators are the only means the North has of gathering military intelligence .
The South can get intelligence from satellite pictures , they say , while the North has to send in commandos .
South Korea has military bases in the area , and there are sure to be intensive efforts to track down any other spies who might have been with the one who died .
The obvious question is why North Korea would risk another humiliation by dispatching commandos into South Korea , particularly so soon after its submarine was snared in the drift net .
Lee Jong -chan , head of South Korea 's intelligence agency , warned last week that North Korea might step up spying and terrorism against South Korea in the next couple of months before the inauguration of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il as his country 's president .
Lee had said that North Korean agencies would redouble their efforts against the South in a show of loyalty to Kim .
While North Korea has not formally announced that Kim will become president , the betting is that he will be named in August or September .
On Sunday , North Korea announced that he had accepted a nomination for the Supreme People 's Assembly , an apparent step toward assuming the presidency .
Another theory that some North Korea experts have offered is that the North Korean leadership , or at least elements within it , are embarrassed by South Korea 's efforts to promote peace .
Only if hard-liners prevail in the South , so the argument goes , will North Korea have a good scapegoat for its closed-door policy with South Korea and for its own economic mess .
So , according to that theory , some elements in the North Korean forces may be just as happy if an incursion causes rage in the South and harder-line policies toward the North .
A final explanation is simply that North Korea infiltrates spies all the time , and that lately it has simply had bad luck .
