COLOMBO , June 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh , who wound up his two-day visit to Sri Lanka Monday evening , has accomplished limited success despite much fanfare about the trip , analysts here said .
Singh Monday reiterated India 's support for the unity , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka which has been troubled by an upsurge in the long-running civil war .
Singh made clear India 's stand during his formal discussions on Monday with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar , said a Sri Lanka - India joint statement released at the end of Singh 's two-day visit .
The statement said Singh expressed `` the continued commitment of the government of India to the unity , sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka . ''
He also conveyed the good wishes and support of the Indian government for the restoration of a lasting peace through a possible political process which would result in a settlement satisfactory to all communities .
Singh brought a credit amounting to 100 million U.S. dollars in a bid to fulfill India 's promise to provide humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka .
Analysts here said that apart from political and moral support there is no substantial Indian help to bring an end to Sri Lanka 's civil war despite the humanitarian loan .
Singh is the first Indian leader to visit here since April when the civil war in Sri Lanka flared up again between government troops and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- rebels who are fighting a 17-year war to carve out a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the island 's north and east .
Singh flew into Colombo on a special flight Sunday afternoon .
Immediately after his arrival , he had an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with his Sri Lankan counterpart , Kadirgamar .
It is believed that the situation in Jaffna took high priority at the talks .
On Sunday evening , Singh held informal discussions with President Kumaratunga over dinner .
During the formal talks on Monday President Kumaratunga apprised Singh of the current war situation and political developments , including the consultations between the government and other political parties and the facilitation efforts of Norway .
Kumaratunga welcomed India 's offer of assistance in the humanitarian and economic spheres to ease the constraints that may be currently faced by Sri Lanka , the statement said .
Kadirgamar hosted a lunch for his Indian counterpart at his residence on Monday .
It is understood that bilateral discussions had continued over lunch .
Leader of the opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe called on Singh to express his party 's stand .
Several moderate Tamil parties ' leaders also met Singh later .
Sri Lanka had earlier sought India 's help when several military camps in the northern Jaffna peninsula fell into the hands of the LTTE .
However , India is wary of direct military involvement because of internal politics and its bitter experience in the late 1980s .
India 's ruling coalition includes several Tamil parties , which have often expressed support for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka ` s Tamils .
In a recent statement , Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi , an influential Tamil leader , suggested that Sri Lanka be split along ethnic lines as a solution to the 17-year-long ethnic conflict .
Karunanidhi , who is head of the DMK regional party , a powerful partner in India 's coalition government , said earlier this month that Sri Lanka could end its `` unhappy marriage '' between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils with a partition similar to that of the former Czechoslovakia .
The suggestion has been flatly rejected by Colombo , where Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said it would lead to the '' balkanization '' of Sri Lanka .
`` It is obvious that the hands of the BJP government are well and truly tied by the pro- LTTE forces ... and it cannot help Sri Lanka , '' Sri Lanka 's Island newspaper said .
Historically , India had tried to broker an end to Sri Lanka 's civil war , but in vain .
Between 1987 to 1990 , India lost 1,200 soldiers who were part of a peacekeeping force in northern Sri Lanka .
The Indian force was hastily withdrawn in 1990 and New Delhi has since stayed on the sidelines .
Consequently , India last month ruled out military involvement in the island nation 's civil war .
However , India has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan government and promised humanitarian assistance if asked .
Indian External Affairs Ministry Spokesman R. S. Jassal told reporters in New Delhi Saturday that Singh 's visit was `` part of a high-level political engagement '' between the two countries .
However , local public opinion believed that the visit was much designed to calm apprehensions in Colombo about the recent statements made by Karunanidhi .
Analysts said there is much skepticism about what India can do to help resolve the conflict .
`` Sri Lanka cannot hope much from India in its hour of need , '' the Island newspaper said in its leader on Monday .
`` We have to be pragmatic and look elsewhere for immediate assistance . ''
But recently , India has backed a negotiated settlement of the conflict and has said it would mediate if invited by both sides .
Since Sri Lanka 's conflicting sides have yet to ask for Indian help , India seems to be at a loss what to do to help end the island 's ethnic war .
