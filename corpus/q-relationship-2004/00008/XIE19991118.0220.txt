TOKYO , November 18 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Japan 's House of Representatives or lower house Thursday approved two bills aimed at tightening controls on AUM Shinrikyo , the cult held responsible for the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system , and facilitating redress to the cult 's victims .
The bills cleared the lower house with the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -LRB- LDP -RRB- and its coalition partners , the Liberal Party -LRB- LP -RRB- and the New Komeito party , as well as the major opposition Democratic Party of Japan -LRB- DPJ -RRB- .
One of the bills , submitted by the Japanese government , will allow the Public Security Investigation Agency to regularly supervise or restrict the activities of AUM followers .
Although not specifically name AUM , the bill says the purpose of the legislation is to impose controls on any group whose members have carried out or attempted `` indiscriminate mass-murder , including ones using sarin , during the past 10 years , '' in effect limiting its scope exclusively to AUM .
Under the bill , groups implicated in serious crimes could be placed under the surveillance of the chief of the Public Security Investigation Agency for up to three years .
Groups under surveillance must report their activities every three months , and police and public security officials can inspect their facilities .
If the groups are found to have broken the law , they can be banned from using or acquiring facilities for up to six months .
The Public Security Commission , at the request of the head of the Public Security Investigation Agency , would decide whether to place groups under surveillance or ban them from acquiring or using facilities .
The Japanese government drafted the bill after receiving complaints from local governments asking for measures against increasing cases of friction between local residents and AUM .
The cult has been trying to expand its presence nationwide and has encountered local resistance in the process .
Many AUM members , including its founder , Shoko Asahara , are on trial for or have been found guilty of a series of crimes including the subway gassing which killed 12 people and injured more than 5,000 .
The other bill , submitted by the LDP and its two coalition partners , is aimed at facilitating the seizure of AUM 's hidden assets to compensate the victims of crimes committed by AUM .
The bill allows bankruptcy administrators to take control of assets held before groups are declared bankrupt , even if those assets have been transferred to other entities .
The two bills are expected to go into effect by the end of this year .
