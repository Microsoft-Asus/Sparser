We will see examples throughout this unit in the connections between biological history and geologic history. Geologic events that alter environments change the course of biological evolution. The formation and subsequent breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, for instance, had a tremendous impact on the diversity of life (see Chapter 25). Conversely, life has changed the planet it inhabits. For example, the evolution of photosynthetic organisms that release oxygen into the air had a dramatic impact on Earth’s atmosphere. (This early photosynthetic life included prokaryotes similar to those in the dense mats that resemble stepping stones in the painting of early Earth on this page.) Much more recently, the emergence of</span> Homo sapiens <span class="Emphasis1">has changed the land, water, and air on a scale and at a rate unprecedented for a single species. The histories of Earth and its life are inseparable</span>.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">These chapters also emphasize key junctures in evolution that have punctuated the history of biological diversity. Geologic history and biological history have been episodic, marked by what were in essence revolutions that opened many new ways of life</span>.</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Historical study of any sort is an inexact discipline that depends on the preservation, reliability, and interpretation of past records. The fossil record of past life is generally less and less complete the farther into the past we delve. Fortunately, each organism alive today carries traces of its evolutionary history in its molecules, metabolism, and anatomy. As we saw in Unit Four, such traces are clues to the past that augment the fossil record. Still, the evolutionary episodes of greatest antiquity are generally the most obscure</span>.</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">This chapter begins with an overview of life’s history. We then take a closer look at the origin of life. That discussion is the most speculative in the entire unit, for no fossil record of that seminal episode exists. The last section of the chapter introduces the main branches of life as a prelude to the survey of biological diversity in Chapters 27-34</span></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
