 Multicellularity originated independently many times

We have seen that the origin of eukaryotes ignited an explosion of biological diversification; unicellular eukaryotes are much more diverse in structure than the simpler prokaryotes. The evolution of multicellular bodies broke through another threshold in structural organization and provided the stock for new waves of evolutionary diversification. Multicellularity evolved several times among early eukaryotes, with diverse multicellular algae such as seaweeds as examples of the results. The evolution of multicellularity also gave rise to plants, fungi, and animals, and we will discuss the origins of those kingdoms in the following chapters.
