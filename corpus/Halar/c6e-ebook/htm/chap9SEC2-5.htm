Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step that transfers all the hydrogen from the fuel to the oxygen at one time. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down gradually in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, hydrogen atoms are stripped from the glucose, but they are not transferred directly to oxygen. They are usually passed first to a coenzyme called <span class="Emphasis2">NAD</span><SUP><span class="Emphasis2">+</span></SUP> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Thus, NAD<SUP>+</SUP> functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">How does NAD<SUP>+</SUP> trap electrons from glucose and other fuel molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms from the substrate, a sugar or some other fuel. We can think of this as the removal of two electrons and two protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms). The enzyme delivers the <span class="Emphasis1">two</span> electrons along with <span class="Emphasis1">one</span> proton to its coenzyme, NAD<SUP>+</SUP> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 9.4</span>). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H<SUP>+</SUP>) into the surrounding solution: <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM9-6.gif"> Though the oxidized form, NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, has a positive charge, the reduced form, NADH, is electrically neutral. By receiving two negatively charged electrons but only one positively charged proton, NAD<SUP>+</SUP> has its charge neutralized. The name NADH for the reduced form shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. Since NAD<SUP>+</SUP> gains electrons, it is an electron acceptor (a synonym for oxidizing agent). The most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration, NAD<SUP>+</SUP> functions in many of the redox steps during the breakdown of sugar.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig9-4','../fig/big/fig9-4.jpg','fig9-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig9-4.jpg" alt="fig9-4" name="myfig9-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 9-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">NAD<SUP>+</SUP> as an electron shuttle.</span> The full name for NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure; the molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together.

It will help to compare this complex redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 9.5a</span>). Mix H<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>2</SUB>, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen fall closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H<SUB>2</SUB>. Second, respiration uses an <span class="Emphasis2">electron transport chain</span> to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps instead of one explosive reaction (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 9.5b</span>). The transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. Electrons removed from food are shuttled by NADH to the "top" end of the chain. At the "bottom" end, oxygen captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H<SUP>+</SUP>), forming water.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig9-5','../fig/big/fig9-5.jpg','fig9-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig9-5.jpg" alt="fig9-5" name="myfig9-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 9-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">An introduction to electron transport chains.

Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor. What keeps the electrons moving is that each carrier is more electronegative than its "uphill" neighbor in the chain. At the bottom of the chain is oxygen, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Thus, electrons removed from food by NAD<SUP>+</SUP> fall down the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Thus, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel this "downhill" route: food <img align="middle" src="../img/sym/rarrow.gif"> NADH <img align="middle" src="../img/sym/rarrow.gif"> electron transport chain 8<SUP>n</SUP> oxygen.
