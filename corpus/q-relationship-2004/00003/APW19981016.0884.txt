<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Hume and David Trimble , joint winners of this year 's Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX> , have traveled dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern Ireland accord .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">For Hume , 61 , the single-minded peacemaker who leads the province 's major Catholic party</ENAMEX> , Friday 's honor from the Norwegian Nobel Committee capped a remarkable career that culminated in an agreement he envisioned decades ago .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">For Trimble , 54 , embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal to the peacemaking efforts</ENAMEX> , the Nobel was more controversial -- particularly considering the omission of his nemesis , Gerry Adams , leader of the IRA -allied Sinn Fein party .
