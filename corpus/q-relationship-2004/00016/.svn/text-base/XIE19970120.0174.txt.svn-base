JOHANNESBURG , January 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Africa would forge closer ties with the Arab world instead of with Israel , according to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki .
`` The government would not follow the previous government 's policy of forging alliance with Israel and being hostile to the Arab world , '' Mbeki told a press conference on Sunday at the end of a three-day closed-door meeting of the ruling African National Congress -LRB- ANC -RRB- .
`` The apartheid government 's policy of dealing with Israel and Arab states was incorrect , '' he stressed , referring to South Africa 's proposed sale of 638 million U.S. Dollars worth of tank firing control systems to Syria .
The development had caused an international stir in the past week .
`` Why would there be an assumption that we should not market our arms in Syria ? '' asked the South African deputy president .
Mbeki defended the controversial Syria arms deal , which he said is still at a `` very preliminary marketing stage '' , by saying that South Africa is independent in forming and executing its own foreign policy .
The United States has threatened to cut its aid to South Africa if it insists to go ahead with its arms sale to Syria , but so far Johannesburg has been turning a deaf ear to the warning .
