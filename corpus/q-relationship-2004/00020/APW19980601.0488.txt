NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
India on Monday rejected reports it was planning another nuclear test , following its call on all nuclear weapons states to start negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention .
Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan 's claims that India was surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was `` surprising '' -- and wrong .
`` India has declared a moratorium on testing , and this has been reiterated by the prime minister himself , '' Singh said .
His ministry reiterated India 's long-standing call for international talks on reducing nuclear weapons in a statement Sunday .
Despite Singh 's firm statement that India 's tests were over , the country 's Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram was quoted by local news agencies as telling fellow scientists at a forum in Bombay Monday that small tests might be carried out for research purposes -- but `` only if necessary . ''
He did not elaborate .
India escalated the long-standing Indo - Pakistan rivalry to the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13 .
In response , Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week .
Pakistan 's Khan said he had credible information that India was `` already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast somewhere in the first or second week in July . ''
Pakistan has not said whether it would test again .
U.S. intelligence sources said they had detected no signs that either Pakistan or India was readying new tests .
The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved from the same British colony 50 years ago .
They are divided by religion -- Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately Hindu -- and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir , which is divided between them and claimed by both countries .
A top Iranian envoy arrived Monday in Pakistan and praised its government for its nuclear tests .
`` From all over the world Muslims are happy that Pakistan has this capability , '' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters .
Kharrazi dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow Pakistan down the nuclear road .
`` We do n't have any nuclear weapons program ... what we have is for peaceful purposes , '' and all Iran 's nuclear facilities are open to international inspectors , he said .
Violence broke out briefly Monday in Srinagar , capital of Indian -held Kashmir , after 100 people who oppose Indian rule distributed sweets in the streets -- a traditional way of celebrating -- and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its nuclear tests .
Some threw stones at police , who responded by beating protesters .
Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups fighting either for Kashmir 's independence or its union with Pakistan .
Pakistan says it lends them only moral support .
