CARACAS , September 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- said Saturday that it will strengthen coordination with non- OPEC oil producing countries to maintain a stable international oil market .
OPEC current president and Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez said that the coordination between OPEC and non- OPEC is vital for stabilizing the international crude prices .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">So Russia , Oman , Norway , Mexico and Angola have been invited as independent oil producers to attend the second OPEC summit , which is slated for September 26-28 here to redefine `` its principles and establish a base for future actions '' as Rodriguez put it </ENAMEX>.
Rodriguez said the five countries have made their contribution to stabilizing crude prices at the international market , which have been hanging far over the OPEC reference price band of 22-28 U.S. dollars this year .
In spite of OPEC 's promise to raise oil production , analysts predict that world crude prices are likely to exceed 40 U.S dollars per barrel by the end of this year .
But , the OPEC president said Wednesday , leaders at the gathering will not discuss the issue of rising price and they will focus on broader issues and principles .
`` The price of a barrel -LRB- of oil -RRB- is not on the agenda for the Caracas meeting because its objective is to adapt the principles of OPEC to the new global reality , '' he said .
On the relations between Iraq and Kuwait , Rodriguez described as `` deplorable '' and the new tension between the two OPEC members and said that it has been exaggerated .
Iraq has repeatedly denied the allegations that it threatens Kuwait which accuses the former of stealing oil under the border areas between them .
Rodriguez said that he hopes the forthcoming summit will help reduce the tension and build peace between the two major middle East oil producing countries .
The 11-member OPEC , which holds more than 75 percent of the world 's known crude oil reserves , held its first summit in Algiers in 1975 .
Since then , all OPEC meetings have been attended by energy ministers .
