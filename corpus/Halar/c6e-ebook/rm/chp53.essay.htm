									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">An ecologist studying plants in the desert performed the following experiment. She staked out two identical plots, including a few sagebrush plants and numerous small, annual wildflowers. She found the same five wildflower species in roughly equal numbers on both plots. She then enclosed one of the plots with a fence to keep out kangaroo rats, the most common grain eaters of the area. After two years, four of the wildflower species were no longer present in the fenced plot, but one species had increased drastically. The control plot had not changed in species diversity. Using the principles of community ecology, propose a hypothesis to explain her results. What additional evidence would support your hypothesis?</p>

									<a name="para98"></a><p class="BlockText">By 1935, hunting and trapping had eliminated wolves from the United States except for Alaska. Because wolves have since been protected as an endangered species, they have moved south from Canada and have become reestablished in the Rocky Mountains and northern Great Lakes. Conservationists who would like to speed up this process have reintroduced wolves into Yellowstone National Park. Local ranchers are opposed to bringing back the wolves because they fear predation on their cattle and sheep. What are some reasons for reestablishing wolves in Yellowstone National Park? What effects might the reintroduction of wolves have on the ecological communities in the region? What might be done to mitigate the conflicts between ranchers and wolves?</p>
