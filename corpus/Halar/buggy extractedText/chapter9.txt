Living is work. Cells organize small organic molecules into polymers, such as proteins and DNA. They pump substances across membranes. Many cells move or change their shapes. They grow and reproduce. Cells must work just to maintain their complex structure, because order is intrinsically unstable. To perform their many tasks, cells require transfusions of energy from outside sources. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight, the energy source for plants and other photosynthetic organisms (FIGURE 9.1, p. 156). Animals, such as the orangutan in the photograph above, obtain fuel by eating plants, or by eating other organisms that eat plants. In this chapter, you will learn how cells harvest the chemical energy stored in organic molecules and use it to regenerate ATP, the molecule that drives most cellular work.

Fig 9-1. Energy flow and chemical recycling in ecosystems. The mitochondria of eukaryotes (including plants and algae) use the organic products of photosynthesis as fuel for cellular respiration, which also consumes the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. Respiration harvests the energy stored in organic molecules to generate ATP, which powers most cellular work. The waste products of respiration, carbon dioxide and water, are the very substances that chloroplasts use as raw materials for photosynthesis. Thus, the chemical elements essential to life are recycled. But energy is not: It flows into an ecosystem as sunlight and leaves as heat.

The first part of this chapter develops these principles, which will then enable you to make sense of cellular respiration and related pathways.

 Feedback mechanisms control cellular respiration



Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from respiration is contingent upon an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell. Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation ceases. However, fermentation provides a mechanism by which some cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP without the help of oxygen.





 Cellular respiration and fermentation are catabolic, energy-yielding pathways

Organic compounds store energy in their arrangement of atoms. With the help of enzymes, a cell systematically degrades complex organic molecules that are rich in potential energy to simpler waste products that have less energy. Some of the energy taken out of chemical storage can be used to do work; the rest is dissipated as heat. As you learned in Chapter 6, metabolic pathways that release stored energy by breaking down complex molecules are called catabolic pathways. One catabolic process, fermentation, is a partial degradation of sugars that occurs without the help of oxygen. However, the most prevalent and efficient catabolic pathway is cellular respiration, in which oxygen is consumed as a reactant along with the organic fuel. In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria house most of the metabolic equipment for cellular respiration.

Although very different in mechanism, respiration is in principle similar to the combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine after oxygen is mixed with the fuel (hydrocarbons). Food is the fuel for respiration, and the exhaust is carbon dioxide and water. The overall process can be summarized as follows: 

Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as fuel, it is traditional to learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose (C6H12O6): 

This breakdown of glucose is exergonic, having a free-energy change of -686 kcal (-2,870 kJ) per mole of glucose decomposed (DG = -686 kcal/mol); recall that a negative DG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants.

Catabolic pathways do not directly move flagella, pump solutes across membranes, polymerize monomers, or perform other cellular work. Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft: ATP. The processes of cellular respiration and fermentation are complex and challenging to learn. Therefore, as you study this chapter, it will help you to keep in mind your main objective: discovering how cells use the energy stored in food molecules to make ATP.





 Cells recycle the ATP they use for work

The molecule known as ATP, short for adenosine triphosphate, is the central character in bioenergetics. Recall from Chapter 6 that the triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a loaded spring; the close packing of the three negatively charged phosphate groups is an unstable, energy-storing arrangement (because like charges repel each other). The chemical "spring" tends to "relax" by losing the terminal phosphate (see FIGURE 6.8). The cell taps this energy source by using enzymes to transfer phosphate groups from ATP to other compounds, which are then said to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation primes a molecule to undergo some kind of change that performs work, and the molecule loses its phosphate group in the process (FIGURE 9.2). The price of most cellular work, then, is the conversion of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (abbreviated Pi in this book), products that store less energy than ATP. To keep working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. A working muscle cell, for example, recycles its ATP at a rate of about 10 million molecules per second. To understand how cellular respiration regenerates ATP, we need to examine the fundamental chemical processes known as oxidation and reduction.

Fig 9-2. A review of how ATP drives cellular work. Phosphate group transfer is the mechanism responsible for most types of cellular work. Enzymes shift a phosphate group (P) from ATP to some other molecule, and this phosphorylated molecule undergoes a change that performs work. For example, ATP drives active transport by phosphorylating certain membrane proteins: drives mechanical work by phosphorylating motor proteins, such as the ones that move organelles along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell; and drives chemical work by phosphorylating key reactants. The phosphorylated molecules lose the phosphate groups as work is performed, leaving ADP and inorganic phosphate (P) as products. Cellular respiration replenishes the ATP supply by powering the phosphorylation of ADP.





 Redox reactions release energy when electrons move closer to electronegative atoms

Just what happens when catabolic pathways decompose glucose and other organic fuels? And why do these metabolic pathways yield energy? The answers are based on the transfer of electrons during the chemical reactions. The relocation of electrons releases the energy stored in food molecules, and this energy is used to synthesize ATP.

In many chemical reactions, there is a transfer of one or more electrons (e-) from one reactant to another. These electron transfers are called oxidation-reduction reactions, or redox reactions for short. In a redox reaction, the loss of electrons from one substance is called oxidation, and the addition of electrons to another substance is known as reduction.* To take a simple, nonbiological example, consider the reaction between sodium and chlorine to form table salt: 

We could generalize a redox reaction this way: 

In the generalized reaction, substance X, the electron donor, is called the reducing agent; it reduces Y. Substance Y, the electron acceptor, is the oxidizing agent; it oxidizes X. Because an electron transfer requires both a donor and an acceptor, oxidation and reduction always go together.

Not all redox reactions involve the complete transfer of electrons from one substance to another; some change the degree of electron sharing in covalent bonds. The reaction between methane and oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, shown in FIGURE 9.3, is an example. As explained in Chapter 2, the covalent electrons in methane are shared equally between the bonded atoms because carbon and hydrogen have about the same affinity for valence electrons; they are about equally electronegative. But when methane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, electrons are shifted away from the carbon atoms to their new covalent partner, oxygen, which is very electronegative. Methane has thus been oxidized. The two atoms of the oxygen molecule also share their electrons equally. But when the oxygen reacts with the hydrogen from methane to form water, the electrons of the covalent bonds are drawn closer to the oxygen; the oxygen molecule has been reduced. Because oxygen is so electronegative, it is one of the most potent of all oxidizing agents.

Fig 9-3. Methane combustion as an energy-yielding redox reaction. During the reaction, covalently shared electrons move away from carbon and hydrogen atoms and closer to oxygen, which is very electronegative. The reaction releases energy to the surroundings, because the electrons lose potential energy as they move closer to electronegative atoms.

Energy must be added to pull an electron away from an atom, just as energy must be added to push a large ball uphill. The more electronegative the atom (the stronger its pull on electrons), the more energy is required to keep the electron away from it, just as more energy is required to push a ball up a steeper hill. An electron loses potential energy when it shifts from a less electronegative atom (one with a weaker pull on electrons) toward a more electronegative one, just as a ball loses potential energy when it rolls downhill. A redox reaction that relocates electrons closer to oxygen, such as the burning of methane, releases chemical energy that can be put to work.





 Electrons "fall" from organic molecules to oxygen during cellular respiration

The oxidation of methane by oxygen is the main combustion reaction that occurs at the burner of a gas stove. The combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine is also a redox reaction; the energy released pushes the pistons. But the energy-yielding redox process of greatest interest here is respiration: the oxidation of glucose and other fuel molecules in food. Examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration, but this time think of it as a redox process: 

As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced, and the electrons lose potential energy along the way.

In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons with the potential to "fall" closer to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the status of electrons changes as hydrogen is transferred to oxygen, liberating energy. By oxidizing glucose, respiration takes energy out of storage and makes it available for ATP synthesis.

The main energy foods, carbohydrates and fats, are reservoirs of electrons associated with hydrogen. Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see FIGURE 6.12). Without this barrier, a food substance like glucose would combine spontaneously with O2. When we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose, it burns in air, releasing 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of heat per mole of glucose (about 180 g). Body temperature is not high enough to initiate burning, which is the rapid oxidation of fuel accompanied by an enormous release of energy as heat. But swallow some glucose in the form of a spoonful of honey, and when the molecules reach your cells, enzymes will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized slowly.





 The "fall" of electrons during respiration is stepwise, via NAD+ and an electron transport chain

The wholesale release of energy from a fuel is difficult to harness efficiently for constructive work: The explosion of a gasoline tank cannot drive a car very far. Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step that transfers all the hydrogen from the fuel to the oxygen at one time. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down gradually in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, hydrogen atoms are stripped from the glucose, but they are not transferred directly to oxygen. They are usually passed first to a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Thus, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration.

How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other fuel molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms from the substrate, a sugar or some other fuel. We can think of this as the removal of two electrons and two protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms). The enzyme delivers the two electrons along with one proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (FIGURE 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution:  Though the oxidized form, NAD+, has a positive charge, the reduced form, NADH, is electrically neutral. By receiving two negatively charged electrons but only one positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized. The name NADH for the reduced form shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. Since NAD+ gains electrons, it is an electron acceptor (a synonym for oxidizing agent). The most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration, NAD+ functions in many of the redox steps during the breakdown of sugar.

Fig 9-4. NAD+ as an electron shuttle. The full name for NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure; the molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together. (Nicotinamide is a nitrogenous base, although not one that is present in DNA or RNA.) The enzymatic transfer of two electrons and one proton from some organic substrate to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH. Most of the electrons removed from food are transferred initially to NAD+.

Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from food to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy that can be tapped to make ATP when the electrons complete their "fall" from NADH to oxygen.

How do electrons extracted from food and stored by NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare this complex redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (FIGURE 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen fall closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps instead of one explosive reaction (FIGURE 9.5b). The transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. Electrons removed from food are shuttled by NADH to the "top" end of the chain. At the "bottom" end, oxygen captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water.

Fig 9-5. An introduction to electron transport chains. (a) The uncontrolled exergonic reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat and light: an explosion. (b) In cellular respiration, the same reaction occurs in stages: An electron transport chain breaks the "fall" of electrons in this reaction into a series of smaller steps and stores some of the released energy in a form that can be used to make ATP. (The rest of the energy is released as heat.)

Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -53 kcal/mol (-222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor. What keeps the electrons moving is that each carrier is more electronegative than its "uphill" neighbor in the chain. At the bottom of the chain is oxygen, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Thus, electrons removed from food by NAD+ fall down the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill.

Thus, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel this "downhill" route: food  NADH  electron transport chain 8n oxygen. In the next major section of the chapter, you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of ATP.





 Respiration involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport: an overview

Respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages, diagrammed in FIGURE 9.6:

Fig 9-6. An overview of cellular respiration. In a eukaryotic cell, glycolysis occurs outside the mitochondria in the cytosol. The Krebs cycle and the electron transport chains are located inside the mitochondria. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. The pyruvate crosses the double membrane of the mitochondrion to enter the matrix, where the Krebs cycle decomposes it to carbon dioxide. NADH or FADH2 (see p. 164) transfers electrons from molecules undergoing glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain converts the chemical energy to a form that can be used to drive oxidative phosphorylation, which accounts for most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration. A smaller amount of ATP is formed directly during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle by substrate-level phosphorylation.

Glycolysis (color-coded teal throughout the chapter)

The Krebs cycle (color-coded salmon)

The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (color-coded violet)

The first two stages, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, are the catabolic pathways that decompose glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. The Krebs cycle, which takes place within the mitochondrial matrix, completes the job by decomposing a derivative of pyruvate to carbon dioxide. Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules.

Some of the steps of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenase enzymes transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (usually via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen to form water (see FIGURE 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion can use to make ATP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions that transfer electrons from food to oxygen.

The site of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation is the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (see FIGURE 7.17). Oxidative phosphorylation accounts for almost 90%  of the ATP generated by respiration. A smaller amount of ATP is formed directly in a few reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle by a mechanism called substrate-level phosphorylation (FIGURE 9.7). This mode of ATP synthesis occurs when an enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP. "Substrate molecule" here refers to an organic molecule generated during the catabolism of glucose.

Fig 9-7. Substrate-level phosphorylation. Some ATP is made by direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from a substrate to ADP. The phosphate donor in this case is phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is formed from the breakdown of sugar during glycolysis.

Respiration cashes in the large denomination of energy banked in glucose for the small change of ATP, which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work. For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 38 molecules of ATP.

This overview has introduced how glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport fit into the overall process of cellular respiration. We are now ready to take a closer look at each of these three stages of respiration.*





 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate: a closer look

The word glycolysis means "splitting of sugar," and that is exactly what happens during this pathway. Glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is split into two three-carbon sugars. These smaller sugars are then oxidized and their remaining atoms rearranged to form two molecules of pyruvate. (Pyruvate is the ionized form of a three-carbon acid, pyruvic acid.)

As summarized in FIGURE 9.8 and described in detail in FIGURE 9.9 (pp. 162--163) the pathway of glycolysis consists of ten steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. We can divide these ten steps into two phases. The energy investment phase includes the first five steps, and the energy payoff phase includes the next five steps. During the energy investment phase, the cell actually spends ATP to phosphorylate the fuel molecules. This investment is repaid with dividends during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by oxidation of the food. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.

Fig 9-9. A closer look at glycolysis. The orientation diagram at the right relates glycolysis to the whole process of respiration. Do not let the chemical detail in the main diagram block your view of glycolysis as a source of ATP and NADH.

Notice in FIGURE 9.9 that all of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no CO2 is released during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not molecular oxygen (O2) is present. However, if oxygen is present, the energy stored in NADH can be converted to ATP energy by the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. And in the presence of oxygen, the chemical energy left in pyruvate can be extracted by the Krebs cycle.





 The Krebs cycle completes the energy-yieldingoxidation of organic molecules: a closer look

Glycolysis releases less than a quarter of the chemical energy stored in glucose; most of the energy remains stocked in the two molecules of pyruvate. If molecular oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the enzymes of the Krebs cycle complete the oxidation of the organic fuel.

Upon entering the mitochondrion, pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA (FIGURE 9.10). This step, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, is accomplished by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: 
			  
		 Pyruvate's carboxyl group, which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2. (This is the first step in respiration where CO2 is released.) 
			  
		 The remaining two-carbon fragment is oxidized to form a compound named acetate (the ionized form of acetic acid). An enzyme transfers the extracted electrons to NAD+, storing energy in the form of NADH. 
			  
		 Finally, coenzyme A, a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached to the acetate by an unstable bond that makes the acetyl group (the attached acetate) very reactive. The product of this chemical grooming, acetyl CoA, is now ready to feed its acetate into the Krebs cycle for further oxidation.

Fig 9-10. Conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. A complex of several enzymes catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The acetyl CoA will enter the Krebs cycle. The CO2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell.

The Krebs cycle is named after Hans Krebs, the German-British scientist who was largely responsible for elucidating the pathway in the 1930s. The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme (FIGURE 9.11). You can see in the diagram that for each turn of the Krebs cycle, two carbons enter in the relatively reduced form of acetate (step 1), and two different carbons leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 (steps 3 and 4). The acetate joins the cycle by its enzymatic addition to the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate. Subsequent steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate, giving off CO2 as "exhaust." It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that accounts for the "cycle" in the Krebs cycle. Except for the enzyme that catalyzes step 6, which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, all the Krebs cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

Fig 9-11. A closer look at the Krebs cycle. In the chemical structures, red type traces the fate of the two carbon atoms that enter the cycle via acetyl CoA (step 1), and blue type indicates the two carbons that exit the cycle as CO2 in steps 3 and 4. Notice that carboxylic acids are represented in their ionized forms, as --COO-. For example, citrate is the ionized form of citric acid.

Most of the energy harvested by the oxidative steps of the cycle is conserved in NADH. For each acetate that enters the cycle, three molecules of NAD+ are reduced to NADH (steps 3, 4, and 8). In one oxidative reaction, step 6, electrons are transferred not to NAD+, but to a different electron acceptor, FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin). The reduced form, FADH2, donates its electrons to the electron transport chain, as does NADH. There is also a step in the Krebs cycle, step 5, that forms an ATP molecule directly by substrate-level phosphorylation, similar to the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis. But most of the ATP output of respiration results from oxidative phosphorylation, when the NADH and FADH2 produced by the Krebs cycle relay the electrons extracted from food to the electron transport chain. Use FIGURE 9.12, page 166, to review the inputs and outputs of the Krebs cycle before proceeding to the electron transport chain.

Fig 9-12. A summary of the Krebs cycle. The cycle functions as a metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate, the product of glycolysis. This diagram summarizes the inputs and outputs as pyruvate is broken down to three molecules of CO2, and it includes the molecule of CO2 released during pre-Krebs cycle conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred during the redox reactions to NAD+ and FAD. The reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH2, shuttle their cargo of high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain, which uses the energy to synthesize ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. (To calculate the inputs and outputs on a "per-glucose" basis, multiply by 2, because each glucose molecule is split during glycolysis into two pyruvate molecules.)





 The inner mitochondrial membrane couples electron transport to ATP synthesis: a closer look

Our main objective in this chapter is to learn how cells harvest the energy of food to make ATP. But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, produce only four molecules of ATP per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: two net ATPs from glycolysis and two ATPs from the Krebs cycle. At this point, molecules of NADH (and FADH2) account for most of the energy extracted from the food. These electron escorts link glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation, which uses energy released by the electron transport chain to power ATP synthesis. In this section, you will first learn how the electron transport chain works, then how the inner membrane of the mitochondrion couples ATP synthesis to electron flow down the chain.

The Pathway of Electron Transport

You learned earlier that the electron transport chain is a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The folding of the inner membrane to form cristae increases its surface area, providing space for thousands of copies of the chain in each mitochondrion. (Once again, we see that structure fits function.) Most components of the chain are proteins. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components essential for the catalytic functions of certain enzymes. During electron transport along the chain, these prosthetic groups alternate between reduced and oxidized states as they accept and donate electrons.

FIGURE 9.13 (p. 166) shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain. Electrons removed from food during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are transferred by NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN in FIGURE 9.13). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (FeS in FIGURE 9.13), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in FIGURE 9.13). This electron carrier is a lipid, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein.

Fig 9-13. Free-energy change during electron transport. Each member of the chain oscillates between a reduced state and an oxidized state. A component of the chain becomes reduced when it accepts electrons from its "uphill" neighbor, which has a lower affinity for electrons (is less electronegative). It then returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to its "downhill," more electronegative, neighbor. At the bottom of the chain is oxygen, which is very electronegative. The overall energy drop for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this fall is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain. The various molecules of the electron transport chain, shown as light purple ovals here, are described in the text. Most of these electron carriers are grouped into multiprotein complexes, shown here and in FIGURE 9.15 in darker purple.

Most of the remaining electron carriers between Q and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes (cyt). Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has four organic rings surrounding a single iron atom. It is similar to the iron-containing prosthetic group found in hemoglobin, the red protein of blood that transports oxygen. But the iron of cytochromes transfers electrons, not oxygen. The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution to form water. (An oxygen atom is represented in FIGURE 9.13 as &#189; O2 to emphasize that the electron transport chain reduces molecular oxygen, O2, not individual oxygen atoms. For every two NADH molecules, one O2 molecule is reduced to two molecules of water.)

Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the Krebs cycle. Notice in FIGURE 9.13 that FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain at a lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH.

The electron transport chain makes no ATP directly. Its function is to ease the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts. How does the mitochondrion couple this electron transport and energy release to ATP synthesis? The answer is a mechanism called chemiosmosis.

Chemiosmosis: The Energy-Coupling Mechanism

Populating the inner membrane of the mitochondrion are many copies of a protein complex called ATP synthase, the enzyme that actually makes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (FIGURE 9.14). ATP synthase works like an ion pump running in reverse. Recall from Chapter 8 that ion pumps use ATP as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients. In the reverse of that process, ATP synthase uses the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP synthesis. The ion gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation is a proton (hydrogen ion) gradient; that is, the power source for the ATP synthase is a difference in the concentration of H+ on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. (We can also think of this gradient as a difference in pH, since pH is a measure of H+ concentration.)

Fig 9-14. ATP synthase, a molecular mill. The ATP synthase protein complex functions as a mill, powered by the flow of hydrogen ions. This complex resides in mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes of eukaryotes and in the plasma membranes of prokaryotes. ATP synthase has three main parts: a rotor, a rod, and a knob. Each part consists of a number of protein subunits.

How does the mitochondrial membrane generate and maintain an H+ gradient? That is the function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in FIGURE 9.15 (p. 168). The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons to pump H+ across the membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ leaks back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. But the ATP synthases are the only patches of the membrane that are freely permeable to H+. The ions pass through a channel in ATP synthase, and this protein complex uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. This coupling mechanism is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push), a term that highlights the connection between the chemical reaction that makes ATP and transport across a membrane. We have previously used the word osmosis in discussing water transport, but here we are referring to the flow of H+ across a membrane.

Fig 9-15. Chemiosmosis couples the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. NADH shuttles high-energy electrons extracted from food during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to an electron transport chain built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The gold arrow traces the transport of electrons, which finally pass to oxygen at the "downhill" end of the chain to form water. As FIGURE 9.13 showed, most of the electron carriers of the chain are grouped into three complexes, each represented here by a purple blob embedded in the membrane. Two mobile carriers, ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c, move rapidly along the membrane, ferrying electrons between the three large complexes. As each complex of the chain accepts and then donates electrons, it pumps hydrogen ions (protons) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. Thus, chemical energy originally harvested from food is transformed into a proton-motive force, a gradient of H+ across the membrane. The hydrogen ions flow back, down their gradient, through a channel in an ATP synthase, another protein complex built into the membrane. The ATP synthase harnesses the proton-motive force to phosphorylate ADP, forming ATP. (This phosphorylation is called oxidative because it is driven by the loss of electrons from food molecules.) The use of an H+ gradient (proton-motive force) to transfer energy from redox reactions to cellular work (ATP synthesis, in this case) is called chemiosmosis.

If you have followed this complex story of chemiosmosis so far, you should have at least two questions. How does the electron transport chain pump hydrogen ions? And how does the ATP synthase use H+ backflow to make ATP? In answer to the first question, researchers have found that certain members of the electron transport chain accept and release protons (H+) along with electrons. At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause H+ to be taken up and released back into the surrounding solution. The electron carriers are spatially arranged in the membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space (see FIGURE 9.15 again). The H+ gradient that results is referred to as a proton-motive force, emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work. The force drives H+ back across the membrane through the specific H+ channels provided by ATP synthase complexes.

Scientists are also learning how the flow of H+ through ATP synthase powers ATP generation. This new understanding of ATP synthase function has emerged from studies of its molecular structure (see FIGURE 9.14). The ATP synthase complex consists of three main parts: a cylindrical rotor within the inner mitochondrial membrane, a knob protruding into the mitochondrial matrix, and an internal rod connecting the two. When hydrogen ions flow through the cylinder down their gradient, they cause the cylinder and the attached rod to rotate, much as a rushing stream turns a waterwheel. The spinning rod brings about a conformational change in the knob, activating catalytic sites where ADP and inorganic phosphate combine to make ATP.

In general terms, chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. In mitochondria, the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions, and ATP synthesis is the work performed. But chemiosmosis also occurs elsewhere and in other variations. Chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate ATP during photosynthesis; in these organelles, light (rather than chemical energy) drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and H+ gradient formation. Prokaryotes, which lack both mitochondria and chloroplasts, generate H+ gradients across their plasma membranes. They then tap the proton-motive force not only to make ATP but also to pump nutrients and waste products across the membrane and to rotate their flagella.

Experiments with bacteria first led British biochemist Peter Mitchell to propose chemiosmosis as an energy-coupling mechanism in 1961. Nearly two decades later, after many scientists had confirmed the centrality of chemiosmosis in energy conversions within bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize. Chemiosmosis has helped unify the study of bioenergetics.





 Cellular respiration generates many ATP molecules for each sugar molecule it oxidizes: a review

Now that we have looked more closely at the key processes of cellular respiration, let's return to its overall function: harvesting the energy of food for ATP synthesis.

During respiration, most energy flows in this sequence: Glucose NADH  electron transport chain  protonmotive force  ATP. We can do some bookkeeping to calculate the ATP profit when cellular respiration oxidizes a molecule of glucose to six molecules of carbon dioxide. The three main departments of this metabolic enterprise are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, which drives oxidative phosphorylation. FIGURE 9.16 gives a detailed accounting of the ATP yield per glucose molecule oxidized. The tally adds the few molecules of ATP produced directly by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to the many more molecules of ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation. Each NADH that transfers a pair of electrons from food to the electron transport chain contributes enough to the proton-motive force to generate a maximum of about three ATPs. (The average ATP yield per NADH is probably between two and three; we are rounding off to three here to simplify the bookkeeping.) The Krebs cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but each molecule of this electron carrier is worth a maximum of only about two molecules of ATP.

Fig 9-16. Review: how each molecule of glucose yields many ATP molecules during cellular respiration. The text explains why the yield of 38 ATP per glucose is only an estimate of the maximum output.

In some eukaryotic cells, this lower ATP yield per electron pair also applies to the NADH produced by glycolysis in the cytosol. The mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, so NADH in the cytosol is segregated from the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation. The two electrons of NADH captured in glycolysis must be conveyed into the mitochondrion by one of several electron shuttle systems. Depending on which shuttle is operating, the electrons are passed either to NAD+ or to FAD. If the electrons are passed to FAD, only about 2 ATP can result from each cytosolic NADH2. If passed to mitochondrial NAD+, the yield is closer to 3 ATP.

Assuming that the more energy-efficient type of shuttle is active, we can add a maximum of 34 ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation to the net of 4 ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation to give a bottom line of 38 ATP. This is only an estimate of the maximum ATP yield from a glucose molecule and is probably somewhat high. One variable that reduces ATP yield is the use of the proton-motive force generated by the redox reactions of respiration to drive other kinds of work. For example, the proton-motive force powers the mitochondrion's uptake of pyruvate from the cytosol.

We can now make a rough estimate of the efficiency of respiration--that is, the percentage of chemical energy stored in glucose that has been restocked in ATP. Recall that the complete oxidation of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy (DG = -686 kcal/mol). Phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP stores at least 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP (p. 94 explains why this number is probably higher under cellular conditions). Therefore, the efficiency of respiration is 7.3 times 38 (maximum ATP yield per glucose) divided by 686, or about 40% . The rest of the stored energy is lost as heat. We use some of this heat to maintain our relatively high body temperature (37&#176;C), and we dissipate the rest through sweating and other cooling mechanisms. Cellular respiration is remarkably efficient in its energy conversion. By comparison, the most efficient automobile converts only about 25%  of the energy stored in gasoline to move the car.





 Fermentation enables some cells to produce ATP without the help of oxygen

How can food be oxidized without oxygen? Remember, oxidation refers to the loss of electrons to any electron acceptor, not just to oxygen. Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. The oxidizing agent of glycolysis is NAD+, not oxygen. Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce two ATPs (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation. If oxygen is present, then additional ATP is made by oxidative phosphorylation when NADH passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain. But glycolysis generates two ATPs whether oxygen is present or not--that is, whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic (from the Greek aer, air, and bios, life; the prefix an- means "without").

Anaerobic catabolism of organic nutrients can occur by fermentation, as mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. Fermentation is an extension of glycolysis that can generate ATP solely by substrate-level phosphorylation--as long as there is a sufficient supply of NAD+ to accept electrons during the oxidation step of glycolysis. Without some mechanism to recycle NAD+ from NADH, glycolysis would soon deplete the cell's pool of NAD+ and shut itself down for lack of an oxidizing agent. Under aerobic conditions, NAD+ is recycled productively from NADH by the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain. The anaerobic alternative is to transfer electrons from NADH to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis.

Fermentation consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate NAD+ by transferring electrons from NADH to pyruvate or derivatives of pyruvate. The NAD+ can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis, which nets two molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. There are many types of fermentation, differing in the waste products formed from pyruvate. Two common types are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.

In alcohol fermentation (FIGURE 9.17a), pyruvate is converted to ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in two steps. The first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate, which is converted to the two-carbon compound acetaldehyde. In the second step, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol. This regenerates the supply of NAD+ needed for glycolysis. Alcohol fermentation by yeast, a fungus, is used in brewing and winemaking. Many bacteria also carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions.

Fig 9-17. Fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, many cells use fermentation to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis. Two of the common waste products formed from fermen-tation are (a) ethanol and (b) lactate, the ionized form of lactic acid.

During lactic acid fermentation (FIGURE 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as a waste product, with no release of CO2. (Lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid.) Lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt. Acetone and methanol (methyl alcohol) are among the by-products of other types of microbial fermentation that are commercially important.

Human muscle cells make ATP by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce. This occurs during the early stages of strenuous exercise, when sugar catabolism for ATP production outpaces the muscle's supply of oxygen from the blood. Under these conditions, the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation. The lactate that accumulates as a waste product may cause muscle fatigue and pain, but the lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver. Lactate is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells.

Fermentation and Respiration Compared

Fermentation and cellular respiration are anaerobic and aerobic alternatives, respectively, for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. Both pathways use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in both fermentation and respiration, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In respiration, by contrast, the final acceptor for electrons from NADH is oxygen. This not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation. An even bigger ATP payoff comes from the oxidation of pyruvate in the Krebs cycle, which is unique to respiration. Without oxygen, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to the cell. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, respiration yields as much as 19 times more ATP per glucose molecule than does fermentation--38 ATP for respiration, compared to 2 ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.

Some organisms, including yeasts and many bacteria, can make enough ATP to survive using either fermentation or respiration. Such species are called facultative anaerobes. On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In a facultative anaerobe, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (FIGURE 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the Krebs cycle. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is diverted from the Krebs cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe would have to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.

Fig 9-18. Pyruvate as a key juncture in catabolism. Glycolysis is common to fermentation and respiration. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation. In a cell capable of both respiration and fermentation, pyruvate is committed to one of those two pathways, usually depending on whether or not oxygen is present.

The Evolutionary Significance of Glycolysis

The role of glycolysis in both fermentation and respiration has an evolutionary basis. Ancient prokaryotes probably used glycolysis to make ATP long before oxygen was present in Earth's atmosphere. The oldest known fossils of bacteria date back over 3.5 billion years, but appreciable quantities of oxygen probably did not begin to accumulate in the atmosphere until about 2.7 billion years ago. (According to fossil evidence, the cyanobacteria that produce O2 as a by-product of photosynthesis had evolved by then.) Therefore, the first prokaryotes may have generated ATP exclusively from glycolysis, which does not require oxygen. In addition, glycolysis is the most widespread metabolic pathway, which suggests that it evolved very early in the history of life. The cytosolic location of glycolysis also implies great antiquity; the pathway does not require any of the membrane-enclosed organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which evolved nearly 2 billion years after the prokaryotic cell. Glycolysis is a metabolic heirloom from the earliest cells that continues to function in fermentation and as the first stage in the breakdown of organic molecules by respiration.





 Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways

So far, we have treated the oxidative breakdown of glucose in isolation from the cell's overall metabolic economy. In this section, you will learn that glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are major intersections of various catabolic and anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways.

The Versatility of Catabolism

Throughout this chapter, we have used glucose as the fuel for cellular respiration. But free glucose molecules are not common in the diets of humans and other animals. We obtain most of our calories in the form of fats, proteins, sucrose and other disaccharides, and starch, a polysaccharide. All these food molecules can be used by cellular respiration to make ATP (FIGURE 9.19).

Fig 9-19. The catabolism of various food molecules. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuel for cellular respiration. Monomers of these food molecules enter glycolysis or the Krebs cycle at various points. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are catabolic funnels through which electrons from all kinds of food molecules flow on their exergonic fall to oxygen.

Glycolysis can accept a wide range of carbohydrates for catabolism. In the digestive tract, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which can then be broken down in the cells by glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Similarly, glycogen, the polysaccharide that humans and many other animals store in their liver and muscle cells, can be hydrolyzed to glucose between meals as fuel for respiration. The digestion of disaccharides, including sucrose, provides glucose and other monosaccharides as fuel for respiration.

Proteins can also be used for fuel, but first they must be digested to their constituent amino acids. Many of the amino acids, of course, are used by the organism to build new proteins. Amino acids present in excess are converted by enzymes to intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Before amino acids can feed into glycolysis or the Krebs cycle, their amino groups must be removed, a process called deamination. The nitrogenous refuse is excreted from the animal in the form of ammonia, urea, or other waste products.

Catabolism can also harvest energy stored in fats obtained either from food or from storage cells in the body. After fats are digested, the glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis. Most of the energy of a fat is stored in the fatty acids. A metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to two-carbon fragments, which enter the Krebs cycle as acetyl CoA. Fats make excellent fuel. A gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrate. Unfortunately, this also means that a dieter must be patient while using fat stored in the body, because so many calories are stockpiled in each gram of fat.

Biosynthesis (Anabolic Pathways)

Cells need substance as well as energy. Not all the organic molecules of food are destined to be oxidized as fuel to make ATP. In addition to calories, food must also provide the carbon skeletons that cells require to make their own molecules. Some organic monomers obtained from digestion can be used directly. For example, as previously mentioned, amino acids from the hydrolysis of proteins in food can be incorporated into the organism's own proteins. Often, however, the body needs specific molecules that are not present as such in food. Compounds formed as intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle can be diverted into anabolic pathways as precursors from which the cell can synthesize the molecules it requires. For example, humans can make about half of the 20 amino acids in proteins by modifying compounds siphoned away from the Krebs cycle. Also, glucose can be made from pyruvate, and fatty acids can be synthesized from acetyl CoA. Of course, these anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways do not generate ATP, but instead consume it.

In addition, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle function as metabolic interchanges that enable our cells to convert some kinds of molecules to others as we need them. For instance, carbohydrates and proteins can be converted to fats through intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. If we eat more food than we need, we store fat even if our diet is fat-free. Metabolism is remarkably versatile and adaptable.





 Feedback mechanisms control cellular respiration

Basic principles of supply and demand regulate the metabolic economy. The cell does not waste energy making more of a particular substance than it needs. If there is a glut of a certain amino acid, for example, the anabolic pathway that synthesizes that amino acid from an intermediate of the Krebs cycle is switched off. The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see FIGURE 6.18). This prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent.

The cell also controls its catabolism. If the cell is working hard and its ATP concentration begins to drop, respiration speeds up. When there is plenty of ATP to meet demand, respiration slows down, sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions. Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway. One important switch is phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis (see FIGURE 9.9). That is the earliest step that commits substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway. By controlling the rate of this step, the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process; phosphofructokinase is thus the pacemaker of respiration (FIGURE 9.20).

Fig 9-20. The control of cellular respiration. Allosteric enzymes at certain points in the respiratory pathway respond to inhibitors and activators that help set the pace of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis, is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP), but it is inhibited by ATP and by citrate. This feedback regulation adjusts the rate of respiration as the cell's catabolic and anabolic demands change.

An allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators, phosphofructokinase is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by AMP, which the cell derives from ADP (see p. 101). As ATP accumulates, inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis. The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated. Phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate, the first product of the Krebs cycle. If citrate accumulates in mitochondria, some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase. This mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. As citrate accumulates, glycolysis slows down, and the supply of acetate to the Krebs cycle decreases. If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the Krebs cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand. Metabolic balance is augmented by the control of other enzymes at other key locations in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Cells are thrifty, expedient, and responsive in their metabolism.

Examine FIGURE 9.1 again to put cellular respiration into the broader context of energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems. The energy that keeps us alive is released, but not produced, by cellular respiration. We are tapping energy that was stored in food by photosynthesis. In the next chapter, you will learn how photosynthesis captures light and converts it to chemical energy.
