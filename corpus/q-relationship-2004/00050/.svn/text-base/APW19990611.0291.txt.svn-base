LOS ANGELES
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Two Mexican bankers and a lawyer have been convicted of conspiring to launder millions of dollars for a Colombian drug cartel in what prosecutors say is the largest such probe in U.S. history .
Three others were acquitted Thursday in the first federal trial stemming from Operation Casablanca , a three-year sting in which agents and an undercover informer posed as money launderers for the Cali cartel .
Dozens of people were arrested in the case that strained U.S. - Mexico relations when Mexican officials learned that U.S. agents were working in Mexico without notifying them .
Prosecutors say they broke a scheme in which bankers charged commissions to accept $ 70 million in cartel drug money while issuing bank drafts for the traffickers .
About 40 Mexican and Venezuelan businessmen were indicted .
U.S. customs officials seized $ 100 million from 14 banks and dozens of individuals who were accused of laundering money for the Cali drug cartel in Colombia , and the Juarez cartel in Mexico .
Convicted of conspiracy and money laundering were Jose Reyes Ortega Gonzales , a former manager of banking operations for Bancomer in Tepatitlan , Mexico ; Manuel Barraza Leon , a Bancomer branch manager in Tijuana ; and Alfonso Labrada Gurrola , who worked at a Tijuana law firm that represented banks .
Acquitted were Javier Alcala Navarro ; Katy Kissel Belfer , a broker at CBI International Securities in Mexico City ; and Fernando Barragan Reyes , a stock broker .
The verdicts capped a trial that ran nearly two months and featured taped evidence allegedly showing defendants processing the illicit funds .
There are three other cases linked to the operation .
Last month , seven other defendants were indicted for laundering money for the Cali cartel and pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy or drug trafficking .
Their sentences are pending .
The other cases involve defendants accused of working for the Juarez cartel , and Venezuelan bankers accused of laundering millions of U.S. dollars for undercover agents posing as narcotics traffickers .
Two of Mexico 's largest banks -- Grupo Financiero Bancomer S.A. and Grupo Financiero Serfin S.A. -- have since agreed to pay $ 500,000 in fines and forfeit $ 13.6 million .
Chargers were dropped against a third Mexican financial institution , Banca Confia , which agreed to forfeit $ 12.1 million seized from its U.S. holdings .
