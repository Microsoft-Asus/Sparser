BOGOTA , Colombia
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Adapting to stepped-up pressure from law enforcement , a new breed of Colombian drug trafficker has abandoned the model of the huge narcotics cartel and is shunning ostentation in favor of a low-key lifestyle .
Out are bodyguards and armor-plated Toyota Landcruisers .
In are taxis and conservative business suits .
`` Today 's drug trafficker shelters himself in very small , subtle organizations , '' Colombia 's national police chief , Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano , said in an interview .
`` He does n't go around anymore in fancy sneakers , with Rolex watch , gold chains and a revolver on his belt . ''
The vast majority of today 's traffickers in Colombia are virtual unknowns .
But they are efficient , U.S. and Colombian officials agree .
The flow of cocaine out of the world 's leading producer nation , estimated at 500 metric tons a year , has not ebbed .
Nor has business declined for Mexican drug lords , who have also adopted a quieter , more business-like style in recent months .
One example is the Arellano Felix gang in Tijuana .
Once known for violence and high visibility , the Arellano Felix brothers are no longer spotted in the upscale Tijuana nightclubs they once frequented .
The shift is more evident in Colombia , however , where the business has become more diffuse .
Gone are the days of the big drug cartels -- conglomerates that controlled the business each step of the way from crop cultivation to cocaine production in secret labs to sales on U.S. streets .
`` This is more like after the breakup of AT and T. Now you have the Baby Bells , '' said a U.S. Embassy official , speaking on condition he not be quoted by name .
`` Notwithstanding , there 's still a lot of dope out there . ''
And it keeps moving into new markets -- Russia , South Africa and Japan are now in vogue .
Colombia 's retooled cocaine trade is once again concentrated in Medellin , the city that the late Pablo Escobar made murderously notorious but was always a model of commercial efficiency .
Authorities have identified 43 trafficking gangs in Colombia , nearly half of them in Medellin .
Each has an average of 10 to 20 associates , compared to the hundreds of people who were on the payrolls of the old cartels .
`` They are mostly people between the ages of 25 and 40 who have no criminal records and work through legitimate small businesses , '' said a Colombian police intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Some of the Medellin traffickers are former Escobar lieutenants , but most are sophisticated newcomers who employ the latest technologies , are Internet savvy , have a keen grasp of global finance and are deft money launderers .
Colombia 's first generation of traffickers , the `` cocaine cowboys '' typified by Escobar , trained legions of young assassins , kept mounds of cash in wicker baskets and concentrated operations in specific regions .
Flaunting their wealth and defying authorities , they went down in flames in the early 1990s after waging a war on the state that killed hundreds .
The successor Cali cartel fared well for a while , bribing police officers , judges , journalists and politicians to look the other way while hiding behind an intricate web of legitimate businesses like its Drogas la Rebaja pharmacy chain .
But with the help of U.S. agents and intelligence , political pressure from Washington and a police anti-corruption purge by Serrano , brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez and the rest of the Cali cartel 's pinstripe-suited principals were caught beginning in 1995 , convicted and jailed .
The new generation remains discreet , and harder to infiltrate .
`` We know of very important traffickers in Medellin who do n't even have cellular phones or beepers .
They know that makes things difficult for us , '' said a police intelligence official .
Witness to the self-destructiveness of the Medellin - Cali rivalry , today 's Colombian traffickers tend to collaborate rather than compete .
They sometimes pool resources , but are autonomous .
And they work equally with right-wing paramilitary groups and leftist rebels , both of whom earn tens of millions of dollars a year from cocaine production .
Medellin 's main drug bosses -- nine are identified in an April 1 intelligence report by Colombia 's equivalent of the FBI obtained by The Associated Press -- allegedly include a major shareholder in a local soccer team and Carlos Castano , a fugitive paramilitary leader who lives in a northern mountain hideout .
`` The business is more dispersed .
They do n't send seven tons like before , but 100 kilos or 50 kilos at a time because that way it 's much more difficult to identify the organization , '' Serrano said .
The new traffickers are also less inclined to violence than their predecessors , although they have killed six judicial investigators in Medellin over the past year , riddling one with 23 bullets from a submachine gun , said a senior judicial official , requesting anonymity for security reasons .
