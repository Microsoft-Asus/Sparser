PLANT RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI OTHER THAN LIGHT

 

 Plants respond to environmental stimuli through a combination of developmental and physiological mechanisms



Plants can neither migrate to a watering hole when water is scarce nor seek shelter when the weather is too windy. A seed, landing upside down in the soil, cannot maneuver itself into an upright position. Because of their immobility, plants must adjust to a wide range of environmental circumstances through developmental and physiological mechanisms. Natural selection has refined these responses. Light is so important in the life of a plant that we devoted the entire previous section to a plant's reception of and response to this one environmental factor. In this section, we examine responses to some of the other environmental stimuli that a plant commonly faces in its "struggle for existence."
