Chapter 15: THE CHROMOSOMAL BASIS OF INHERITANCE

RELATING MENDELISM TO CHROMOSOMES

   Mendelian inheritance has its physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles

   Morgan traced a gene to a specific chromosome

   Linked genes tend to be inherited together because they are located on the same chromosome

   Independent assortment of chromosomes and crossing over produce genetic recombinants

   Geneticists can use recombination data to map a chromosome's genetic loci



SEX CHROMOSOMES

   The chromosomal basis of sex varies with the organism

   Sex-linked genes have unique patterns of inheritance



ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS IN CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE

   Alterations of chromosome number or structure cause some genetic disorders

   The phenotypic effects of some mammalian genes depend on whether they were inherited from the mother or the father (imprinting)

   Extranuclear genes exhibit a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance

It was not until the year 1900 that biology finally caught up with Gregor Mendel. At that time, three botanists, working independently on plant-breeding experiments, reproduced Mendel's results. By searching the scientific literature, the German Karl Correns, the Austrian Erich von Tschermak, and the Dutchman Hugo de Vries all found that Mendel had explained the same results 35 years before. During the intervening years, biology had grown more experimental and quantitative and thus more receptive to Mendelism. Nevertheless, many biologists remained incredulous about Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment until evidence had mounted that these principles of heredity had a physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes. Mendel's hereditary factors--genes--are located on chromosomes. For example, the yellow dots (a fluorescent dye) in the light micrograph on this page mark the locus of a specific gene on a homologous pair of human chromosomes (which have already replicated, hence the two dots per chromosome). This chapter integrates and extends what you have learned in the past two chapters by describing the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions.
