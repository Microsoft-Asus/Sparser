Sir Lynden O. Pindling , the prime minister of the Bahamas for 25 years , whose reputation and relationship with the United States were marred by unresolved accusations of protecting drug traffickers , died on Saturday at his home in Nassau .
He was 70 .
The cause was prostate cancer , aides said in a statement .
Pindling was prime minister from 1967 to 1992 , leading the Bahamas through tremendous change , including the transition from a British colony to independence in 1973 .
He was defeated in the 1992 election by the current prime minister , Hubert Ingraham .
At the time of his defeat , Pindling had been in office longer than any leader in the Western Hemisphere except Fidel Castro of Cuba .
On Saturday , as radio and television stations in the Bahamas broadcast tributes to Pindling , Ingraham called him `` a giant of our times , '' according to The Associated Press .
Left unmentioned , however , were allegations dating to the 1980s that political observers in the Bahamas say contributed to Pindling 's defeat .
He was accused of covering up for drug traffickers and taking bribes as the chairman of the nation 's Hotel Commission .
A Bahamian government commission was unable to substantiate any of the claims , but the allegations had pronounced political ramifications .
Pindling remained a member of the House of Assembly until 1997 , when he resigned after 41 years in that legislative body .
At the time , he said he was `` less than perfect , '' but added , `` When all I did for good is put in the balance against all I did for ill or failed to do at all , I hope that future generations will not find me sorely wanting . ''
In 1953 , he helped found the Progressive Liberal Party , a political organization dedicated to overthrowing the mostly white colonial-run United Bahamian Party .
Some supporters called him the `` black Moses . ''
When Pindling was first elected prime minister in 1967 , he ended a tradition of white minority rule that had been in place for centuries .
He devoted his first term in office to securing independence from Britain and used that prestige to win five more elections .
Pindling spent much of his time working to improve the reputation of his country , but became vulnerable to charges of corruption in 1984 , when an official commission set up to investigate drug trafficking in the Bahamas found wide evidence of official corruption in his Cabinet and in the Bahamian police .
The commission eventually cleared Pindling of any wrongdoing , but said he and his wife had at least $ 3.5 million in bank deposits that could not be accounted for .
At the 1987 trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas , a founder of the Medellin cocaine cartel in Colombia , prosecutors charged that Lehder and other drug traffickers had paid at least $ 5 million to Pindling for permission to use the Bahamas as a shipment point for cocaine and marijuana bound for the United States .
Several drug smugglers testified that they had made such payments directly to him .
The prime minister denied the accusations .
After Lehder 's conviction , the United States sought to confiscate his holdings in the Bahamas , but was rebuffed by Pindling .
He continued to quarrel with the United States until his 1992 defeat .
By that year , though , a decline in the economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s had become the decisive factor for many voters .
Tourism was by far the largest source of employment and revenue in the nation of more than 700 islands , and the Bahamas was finding it difficult to compete with other vacation destinations .
To many young voters , Pindling was seen not as a father of their country , but as an international pariah who could not get them jobs .
He is survived by his wife , Lady Marguerite ; two sons , Obafemi , 40 , and Leslie , 39 ; two daughters , Michelle Sands , 38 , and Monique Johnson , 34 ; and five grandchildren .
