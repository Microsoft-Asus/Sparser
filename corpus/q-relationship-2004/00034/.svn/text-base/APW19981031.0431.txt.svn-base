<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has approved multi-million dollar business ventures with longtime rival South Korea in a meeting with the founder of the South 's largest conglomerate .
`` General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will benefit both countries , '' Chung Ju -yung , 84 , honorary chairman of the Hyundai group , told journalists in the neutral village of Panmunjom Saturday .</ENAMEX>
Returning Saturday across the heavily guarded border from his five-day visit to the isolated communist state , Chung described the 56-year -old Kim as a `` very kind and respectful young man . ''
Chung is the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he completed his ascension to power in September .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In their meeting late Friday at a Pyongyang guest house , Kim welcomed Hyundai 's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week on luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain , a scenic attraction on the North 's east coast , Hyundai officials said .
In exchange for the right to develop Diamond Mountain with tax exemptions , Hyundai agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years in monthly payments , they said .</ENAMEX>
The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter- Korea joint venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 .
The first cruise ship will sail for the North on Nov. 18 , Hyundai said .
South Korean President Kim Dae -jung has taken a `` sunshine policy '' toward the North , encouraging his nation to push for contacts outside the government with the North Korea , with hopes that will help open up the North .
Kim Jong Il -- who took over leadership duties after his father Kim Il Sung died in 1994 -- had been widely expected to welcome badly needed outside capital to revive his country 's economy .
The impoverished North now depends on outside aid to feed its 23 million people .
His blessing to Hyundai 's projects may also signal a greater openness from the North -- and a thawing of relations between the North and the South .
North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of Rajin - Sonbong as a free economic zone .
But some of Hyundai 's projects call for foreign investment in the country 's heartland .
South Korea 's chief presidential Park Jie -won called Chung 's meeting with Kim `` a very significant development '' but refused further comment .
Experts tend to have reservations about Hyundai plans because joint-ventures between the two Koreas have always been vulnerable to political and military tensions .
Still , Chung 's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean leader set off a media sensation here .
Major TV stations interrupted their regular programming to carry special reports on their meeting , and newspapers carried front-page articles .
North Korean newspapers also carried front-page reports with photos , the North 's official Korean Central News Agency said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Other Hyundai - North Korea deals call for building a power plant and gymnasium in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital , as well as a ship repair yard , and hotels , spas , golf courses and ski slopes near Diamond Mountain .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North Korea 's west coast and if successful , to lay an oil pipeline to South Korea .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hyundai will also build an industrial complex where South Korea can relocate facilities to use North Korean labor -- estimated at one-eighth the cost of South Korean labor .</ENAMEX>
Chung crossed the border Tuesday , with a convoy of 51 trucks carrying 501 cattle and 20 Hyundai cars .
In his first trip , in June , he also took 500 cattle .
