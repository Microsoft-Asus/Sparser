UNITED NATIONS --
Frustrated by a decision in the Security Council to renew its oil-for food program for only two weeks , Iraq on Monday unexpectedly began to cut off its oil exports .
The sales are permitted under a specially regulated U.N. program meant to provide food and other basics for ordinary Iraqis suffering under long-lasting economic sanctions .
The sanctions are meant to punish Baghdad for not showing that it has eliminated weapons of mass destruction .
If Iraq fails to carry out the food program , `` it will be thumbing its nose at the international community again , '' said James Rubin , the U.S. State Department spokesman .
The Iraqis said they were protesting the Security Council 's decision last week to extend the program for only two weeks , instead of the normal six months .
The shorter extension was set when Russia was unable to change the terms in Iraq 's favor .
Some diplomats and officials said that it was not entirely clear what Iraq had to gain , but that Iraq has repeatedly created crises when events were not moving in its favor , and it sometimes came out ahead by doing so .
The suspension of oil sales could allow Iraq to show the world how economic sanctions are again crippling the lives of its ordinary people .
Actions by the secretive government are rarely fully explained and officials at the United Nations have become accustomed to waiting for Iraqi policy changes to play themselves out .
Initial impressions late Monday were that the oil cutoff was temporary but could hurt Iraq 's reputation further .
Rubin said , `` Every time that Iraq shows its contempt for the world , and its contempt for the world 's concern about the people of Iraq , it only makes it harder for Iraq 's positions to be taken seriously in the Security Council . ''
Fred Eckhard , the U.N. spokesman , said that independent oil experts reported Monday morning that the Iraqis had cut the flow of oil to the Turkish port of Ceyhan and were preparing to stop shipments from the Iraqi port of Mina al Bakr on Tuesday .
They are its main export points .
Afterward , crude-oil prices rose in the New York market by almost a dollar , to over $ 27 a barrel , a nine-year high .
Iraq had been trading about 5 percent of the oil sold worldwide .
Under the oil-for-food program , Iraq earned over $ 7 billion in the past six months .
Under pressure to reinstitute a disarmament program and send inspectors back to Iraq after a year during which President Saddam Hussein has been free of on-the-ground arms surveillance , the five permanent council members -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- have been working almost nonstop on a compromise that would allow Russia , Iraq 's strongest ally on the council , to support a new plan , or at least not veto it .
Some diplomats say that the Iraqis may have been stunned by reports that the Russians might be willing to drop their strong advocacy for Iraq .
Reports last week suggested that Moscow had informally offered the United States a deal to soften Russian opposition to a Western resolution on Iraq , in return for U.S. restraint in criticizing Moscow 's war in Chechnya .
The Russians deny that such an offer was made .
France , which at times has argued in favor of Iraq , is now considered to be part of the consensus behind a tougher resolution demanding that Iraq accept and cooperate with arms inspectors in return for a suspension of sanctions -- but not a total removal of sanctions -- for renewable periods .
The French say they are concerned that Iraq , with a record of secret prohibited arms programs , is not being monitored .
France is now expected to back the new inspection system being discussed .
Iraq has said repeatedly that it will not accept any inspection system that does not lift sanctions first .
The government , which has long chafed under the close monitoring and tight financial controls of the oil-for-food program , may be trying to hold it hostage at a critical moment to win concessions on both plans .
But diplomats and officials here say that Iraq may be concerned that the oil plan and inspections may be dealt with as a package in the council , leaving little room for maneuver for the Iraqis .
The Russians have consistently rejected this linkage but ironically made it more likely by delaying the extension last week after the Russian delegation failed to change it in Iraq 's favor .
The Security Council 's permanent members are sharply divided on several parts of the arms-inspection plan .
These include how long to wait before Iraq would qualify for a suspension of sanctions after demonstrating cooperation , how long the suspensions would run before being reviewed and how independent a new inspection commission would be .
The danger for the United Nations is that by shutting down oil flows and continuing to oppose a new disarmament plan , Iraq might effectively free itself of foreign supervision .
This would raise the question of military action to enforce Security Council resolutions .
The United States has been silent about this possibility , in contrast to last year 's bellicose policy , which led to the bombing of Iraq in December -- and the effective end of the old U.N. arms control system there .
U.N. officials were taking a `` wait and see '' attitude and were leaving the administrator of the program and his staff in place in Iraq , and civilian goods ordered earlier were continuing to flow to the country , Eckhard , the U.N. spokesman , said .
`` There are an awful lot of supplies in the pipeline , so our work does n't need to stop just because the oil stopped flowing , '' he said .
`` Our hope is that this can eventually be worked out and they will continue the oil-for-food program . ''
The program -- long delayed by Iraq and never really liked by Baghdad , which resented the controls and monitoring of sales and purchases that came with it -- was intended to relieve the hardships of ordinary Iraqi citizens .
Sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 .
In April 1991 , after the war to free Kuwait ended , sanctions were not only left in place but also linked to a Security Council disarmament plan designed to destroy Iraq 's prohibited biological , chemical , nuclear and missile programs as well as the capacity to rebuild them .
By the fall of 1991 , it was becoming apparent to the Security Council that the disarming of Iraq by the U.N. Special Commission would take considerably longer than expected and that the sanctions were beginning to take a toll on Iraqi civilians .
The council offered Saddam the first oil-for-food program , which was rejected by Iraq .
Four years later , a second oil-for-food plan was presented to the Iraqis , who finally accepted in 1996 after months of stalling , and goods began to arrive in 1997 .
The current plan , as amended , allowed Iraq to export $ 5.26 billion worth of oil every six months .
Because of rising oil prices and Iraq 's inability to meet past quotas , the Security Council had allowed the total sales to increase to about $ 7 billion in the six-month period that has just ended .
