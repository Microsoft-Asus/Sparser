MACAO , February 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- More than 30 celebrities in Macao held a seminar today to mark the speech made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin last year on the reunification of China , saying it is still of great importance to the issue .
Lee Shing Chun , director of the Macao Daily News , praised Jiang 's eight propositions for solving the issue of Taiwan as pragmatic and feasible .
`` It has not only taken care of the overall interests of the Chinese nation , but in particular of the interests of the 21 million Taiwan compatriots , '' Lee said .
He pointed out that the Taiwan authorities are seeking a real `` independence '' under the `` beautiful slogan '' of reunification , saying that it is very dangerous for the Taiwan authorities to do so .
He urged the Taiwan authorities to follow the strong desire of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits , and cooperate well with the other side of the straits to stand the economic challenges facing the Chinese nation in the 21st century .
`` I hope that Lee Teng -hui of Taiwan would wake up to the danger at the last moment , and stop creating ` two Chinas ' or ` one China , one Taiwan ' in action rather than in words , '' he said .
Ma Man Kei , president of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Macao , said Jiang 's speech has brought a profound influence to the promotion of relations across the Taiwan Straits and the reunification of the motherland , and that Jiang 's propositions are still of great importance .
He stressed that any attempt by Taiwan separatists or foreign anti- Chinese power to distort the history of Taiwan and split the motherland are doomed to failure .
`` The attempts to create ` two Chinas ' or ` one China , one Taiwan ' are against the will of the Chinese people , including those living in Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macao and other parts of the world , '' he said .
He urged the Taiwan authorities and compatriots to take consideration of the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and be united under the banner of patriotism so that the reunification of the motherland can be achieved as soon as possible .
