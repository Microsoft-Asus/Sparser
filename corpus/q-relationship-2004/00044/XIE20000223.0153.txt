Nigerian Minister of Police Affairs , David Jemibewon , was on a visit to South Africa to devise ways of combating the wave of crimes and identify areas of cooperation between the two countries , the Post reported .
The Nigerian police have a lot to learn from their South African counterparts , the minister was quoted as saying .
