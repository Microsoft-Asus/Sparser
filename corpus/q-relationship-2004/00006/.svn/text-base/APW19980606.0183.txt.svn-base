Russia 's control systems for nuclear weapons are just as reliable as those in the United States , the head of the U.S. Strategic Command said Saturday .
Gen. Eugene Habiger , following an inspection tour of weapons sites and storage facilities , said Russia 's strategic forces were capable of protecting nuclear bases and preventing any unsanctioned use of the weapons , the ITAR - Tass and Interfax news agencies reported .
`` Despite the difference in approach , Washington and Moscow have a common goal : to guarantee the impossibility of any unsanctioned actions , '' Interfax quoted Harbiger as saying .
Harbiger called for the speedy ratification of the START -2 arms limitation treaty by Russia 's parliament , saying ratification would be in the best interests of both countries .
Commenting on the recent nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan , Harbiger said the two countries would need at least three years to move from testing to fully deployment of nuclear weapons systems .
The U.S. Strategic Command is located at Offutt Air Force BAse in Omaha , Nebraska , and is in charge of the planning for potential nuclear confrontation .
Its forces also do analytical studies for strategic nuclear policy and arms control matters .
During his stay , Harbiger visited a base for SS -19 rockets at Kozelsk , a strategic bomber base in Engels and a missile complex in Irkutsk .
On Saturday , he and Vladimir Yakovlev , commander of Russia 's strategic forces , flew to the northern port of Murmansk to visit a nuclear submarine base .
