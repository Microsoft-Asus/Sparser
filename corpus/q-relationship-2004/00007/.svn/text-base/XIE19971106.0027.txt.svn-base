CANBERRA , November 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Unemployment in Australia would climb above 11 percent and hopes of economic growth of four percent or more would be dashed as part of the fallout from the Asian economic crisis , an Australian economic think tank said today .
The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research -LRB- NIEIR -RRB- , one of the first economic think tanks to warn of the impending danger to Australia from the currency turmoil in Southeast Asia , revised its forecast to predict an even worse scenario for the Australian economy .
Peter Brain , NIEIR executive director , predicted one percent would be lopped off economic growth for this financial year -LRB- July of 1997 to June of 1998 -RRB- , with at least 60,000 jobs lost in Australia because of the Asia crisis .
Australia 's current jobless rate stands at about eight percent .
While one percent would be cut from this financial year 's economic growth predictions , the think tank anticipated the full impact of the Asian economic crisis would begin around 1999 as some of Australia 's major trading partners in northern Asia suffered a `` severe growth correction '' .
`` The Asian economic crisis will continue to seriously undermine Australia 's net trade performance over the next three years , '' Dr Brain said in a statement .
Asia buys about 40 billion US dollars worth of Australian goods and services each year , around 60 percent of everything Australia sells to the world , and Southeast Asia 's annual purchase of eight billion US dollars worth of Australian agricultural and mineral products alone accounts for about 15 percent of Australia 's total export figure .
Analysts say Australia 's export to the region will be affected by the devaluation of local currencies and cuts in the region 's government spending .
Dr Brain suggested the Australian government could be forced to increase the budget surplus through increased taxes and spending cuts as part of its tax reform initiatives , in a bid to minimize the size of interest rate rises required to address the current account deficit blow out .
The think tank revised forecasts came ahead of an expected downgrading of Australian economic growth by the Paris -based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- .
The OECD has already confirmed it planned to lower forecasts for 1997 economic growth in Australia , New Zealand , Japan and South Korea , in part because of Asia 's economic crisis , but is yet to publish the exact size of the revision .
