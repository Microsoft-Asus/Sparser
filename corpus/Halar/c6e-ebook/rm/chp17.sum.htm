It follows the same base-pairing rules as DNA replication, except that in RNA, uracil substitutes for thymine.

Most eukaryotic genes have introns, noncoding regions interspersed among the coding regions, exons. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined. RNA splicing is catalyzed by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), operating within larger assemblies called spliceosomes. In some cases, RNA alone catalyzes splicing. Catalytic RNA molecules are called ribozymes. The shuffling of exons by recombination may contribute to the evolution of protein diversity.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity17C:<span class="Emphasis1">

The attachment of a specific amino acid to its particular tRNA is an ATP-driven process catalyzed by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme. Ribosomes coordinate the three stages of translation: initiation, elongation, and termination. Each ribosome is composed of two subunits made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Ribosomes have a binding site for mRNA; P and A sites that hold adjacent tRNAs as amino acids are linked in the growing polypeptide chain; and an E site for release of tRNA. The formation of peptide bonds is catalyzed by one of the rRNA molecules. A number of ribosomes can work on a single mRNA molecule simultaneously, forming a polyribosome. After translation, the protein may be modified in ways that affect its three-dimensional shape.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity17D:<span class="Emphasis1">
