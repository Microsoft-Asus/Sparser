For example, plants of the legume family (peas, beans, alfalfa, and others) have lumps on their roots called nodules, which are home to mutualistic prokaryotes that fix nitrogen used by the host (see <span class="Emphasis1">Rhizobium</span> in TABLE 27.3). The plant reciprocates by providing the pro karyotes with a steady supply of sugar and other organic nutrients. Bacteria inhabiting the inner and outer surfaces of the human body consist mostly of commensal species, but some species are mutualistic symbionts. For instance, fermenting bacteria living in the vagina produce acids that maintain a pH between 4.0 and 4.5, suppressing the growth of yeast and other potentially harmful microorganisms. Among parasitic bacteria are those classified as pathogens because they cause disease in their hosts.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
