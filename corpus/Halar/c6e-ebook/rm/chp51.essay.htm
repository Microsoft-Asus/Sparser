									<a name="para95"></a><p class="BlockText">In human affairs, we often explain our behavior in terms of subjective feelings or motives or reasons; but evolutionary explanations for behavior work in terms of reproductive fitness. What is the relationship between the two kinds of explanation? For instance, is a human explanation for behavior, such as "falling in love," incompatible with an evolutionary explanation? Does falling in love become more meaningful or less meaningful (or neither) if it has an evolutionary basis?</p>

									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">Scientists studying scrub jays found that it is common for "helpers" to assist mated pairs of birds in raising their young. The helpers lack territories and mates of their own. Instead, they help the territory owners gather food for their offspring. Propose a hypothesis to explain what advantage there might be for the helpers to engage in this behavior instead of seeking their own territories and mates. How would you test your hypothesis? If your hypothesis is correct, what kind of results would you expect your tests to yield?</p>

									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">Researchers are very interested in studying identical twins who were separated at birth and raised apart. So far, the data suggest that these twins are much more alike than researchers would have predicted; they have similar personalities, mannerisms, habits, and interests. What kind of general question do you think researchers hope to answer by studying twins that have been raised apart? Why do identical twins make good subjects for this kind of research? What do the results suggest to you? What are the potential pitfalls of this research? What abuses might occur if the studies are not evaluated critically and if the results are carelessly cited in support of a particular social agenda?</p>
