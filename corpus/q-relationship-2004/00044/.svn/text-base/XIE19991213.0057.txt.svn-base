LAGOS , December 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Nigeria will initiate moves towards enhancing social and economic cooperation among African countries to reduce over-dependence on Western countries for economic growth , The Punch newspaper reported Monday .
The moves are to whittle down the overbearing influence of the United States and some member nations of the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- in the world 's financial institutions which have reduced most African nations to beggar nations , a source from Nigeria 's Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying .
According to the unidentified official , a Nigerian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sule Lamido will make Nigeria 's initiative at a conference on security , stability , development and cooperation in Africa to be held in Tanzania on December 17-20 .
`` The new initiative is to make African countries come together in all areas , even the military , '' the official said , adding that `` we can have African High Command like the U.N. peace-keeping force to help check crises in the continent . ''
The Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- had ratified the conference on its agenda and given a legal backing to it as the major integrating point for African countries , according to the official .
The Kampala Document was adopted in 1991 by the Africa Leadership Forum in conjunction with the OAU and U.N. Economic Commission for Africa .
It stipulated that `` the security and stability of each African country was inseparably linked with the security of all African countries '' and '' Africa cannot make any significant progress on any other front without creating collectively a lasting solution to its problems of security and stability .
