The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed (see Chapter 6). This means that for all ecosystems, we can potentially trace energy exactly from its input as solar radiation to its release as heat from organisms. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy to chemical energy, but the total amount of energy does not change. The total amount of energy stored in organic molecules plus the amount reflected and dissipated as heat must equal the total incident energy in the form of sunlight. One important objective of ecosystem ecology is to compute such energy budgets and trace the energy flow in particular ecosystems.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The second law of thermodynamics tells us that energy conversions cannot be completely efficient--that some energy will be lost; as heat in any conversion process (see Chapter 6). This idea suggests that we can measure the efficiency of ecological energy conversions in the same way we measure the efficiency of light bulbs and car engines.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">While energy in ecosystems is dissipated ultimately as heat into outer space, chemical elements are continually recycled. A unit of energy moves through the trophic structure of an ecosystem only once, and without the sun providing continuous energy to Earth, ecosystems would vanish. In contrast, a carbon or nitrogen atom moves from trophic level to trophic level and eventually to the decomposers and then back again in endless cycles. Elements are not lost on a global scale, although they may move out of one ecosystem and into another. The measurement and analysis of these cycles of chemical elements in ecosystems and in the entire biosphere are an important part of ecosystem ecology.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Now that we have considered energy flow and material cycling in the context of trophic structures, let’s take a closer look at these dynamics, beginning with the producers.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
