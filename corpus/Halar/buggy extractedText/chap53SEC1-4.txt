BIOGEOGRAPHIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE BIODIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES

 

 Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance



 

 Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient



 

 Species richness is related to a community's geographic size



 

 Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland



Ecological communities vary extensively in the number of species they contain. Two key factors correlated with a community's biodiversity, or species diversity, are its size and geographic location. In the 1850s, both Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin pointed out that plant and animal life was generally more abundant and varied in the tropics than in other parts of the globe. Darwin and Wallace also noted that small or remote islands have fewer species than large islands or those nearer continents. Such observations imply that biogeographic patterns in biodiversity conform to a set of basic principles rather than being accidents of evolutionary history. How can we explain these large-scale patterns in the diversity of life? We must first learn how to measure the biodiversity of a community.
