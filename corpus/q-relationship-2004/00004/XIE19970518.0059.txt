ANKARA , May 18 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A Turkish contingent of about 25,000 to 50,000 has crossed the border into northern Iraq assauting the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- , a move intended to bring stability to the poverty-stricken eastern and southeastern Turkey</ENAMEX> .
The military operation is also meant to facilitate an appropriate situation so as to develop the economy in the region .
However , the large-scale cross-border intervention has drawn fire internationally .
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire , the cross-border assault against the PKK this year is significantly different from the previous ones .
The Turkish military operation , the largest in scale over the past few years , followed a request for help by Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- leader Mesud Barzani .
The KDP gave the best guidance ever to the Turkish security forces against the PKK .
Now , there is no doubt that the KDP preferred Turkish friendship .
According to the KDP information , Turkish F -4 fighters and F16 fighters every morning take off from the air bases in Diyarbakir , center of southeastern Turkey , and in Ehrac of Malatya province , bombed the selected PKK areas of Sinat , Hakurk , Zeli , Shivi and Zap in northern Iraq .
Later , Super Cobra helicopter gunships also raided the PKK bases in the region .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Turkish government troops have killed at least 902 PKK rebels , wounded 126 others and 15 PKK militants surrendered to the security forces during the military operation which was launched Wednesday , Turkish military sources said</ENAMEX> .
The sources added that twelve Turkish military personnel also died and 25 others were injured in the operation .
Following the four-day strong intrusion , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">most of the PKK rebels in northern Iraq have fled toward the Iranian - Iraqi border , but to their dismay , the Turkish government troops cut off the escape route to Iran</ENAMEX> .
Therefore , the PKK rebels had to hide in the mountains between Dohuk and Sersing .
Other PKK militants were trapped between the Turkish crossing between Habur and the Syrian border .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Turkish forces , who have entered 40 kilometers deep inside northern Iraq , fanned out into the Iraqi mountains , hunting for the PKK guerrillas</ENAMEX> .
