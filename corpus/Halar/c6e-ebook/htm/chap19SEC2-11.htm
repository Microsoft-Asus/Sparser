We will focus on the products of two key genes, the <span class="Emphasis1">ras</span> proto-oncogene and the <span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> tumor-suppressor gene. Mutations in these genes are very common in human cancers: <span class="Emphasis1">ras</span> is mutated in about 30%  of human cancers; for <span class="Emphasis1">p53,</span> the frequency is close to 50% .</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Both the Ras protein and the p53 protein are components of signal-transduction pathways that convey external signals to the DNA in the cell’s nucleus. You saw a generalized version of such a pathway in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.17</span>. Now, in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 19.14a</span> you can see that Ras, the product of the <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">ras</span> gene,</span> is a G protein that relays a growth signal from a growth factor receptor on the plasma membrane to a cascade of protein kinases. The cellular response at the end of the pathway is the synthesis of a protein that stimulates the cell cycle. Normally, such a pathway will not operate unless triggered by the appropriate growth factor. However, an oncogene protein that is a hyperactive version of a protein in the pathway can increase cell division even in the absence of growth factor. Many <span class="Emphasis1">ras</span> oncogenes have a point mutation that leads to a hyperactive version of the Ras protein, one that issues signals on its own. In fact, hyperactive versions or excess amounts of any of the pathway’s components can have the same outcome: excessive cell division.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig19-14','../fig/big/fig19-14.jpg','fig19-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig19-14.jpg" alt="fig19-14" name="myfig19-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 19-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Signaling pathways that regulate cell growth.</span> Both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways regulate the cell cycle, commonly by influencing transcription.

Thus, the genes for the components of the pathway act as tumor-suppressor genes (as do genes whose products interfere with the growth-stimulating pathway). The tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the wild-type <span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> gene is a transcription factor that promotes the synthesis of growth-inhibiting proteins. That is why a mutation knocking out the <span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> gene can lead to excessive cell growth and cancer.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The modestly titled <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> gene,</span> named for the 53,000-dalton molecular weight of its protein product, is often called the "guardian angel of the genome." Damage to the cell’s DNA acts as a signal that leads to the expression of the <span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> gene. Once made, the p53 protein functions as a transcription factor for several genes. Often it activates a gene called <span class="Emphasis1">p21,</span> whose product halts the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing time for the cell to repair the DNA; the protein p53 can also turn on genes directly involved in DNA repair. When DNA damage is irreparable, p53 activates "suicide" genes, whose protein products cause cell death by a process called <span class="Emphasis1">apoptosis</span> (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 21.18</span>). Thus, in at least three ways, p53 prevents a cell from passing on mutations due to DNA damage. If mutations do accumulate and the cell survives through many divisions--as is more likely if the <span class="Emphasis1">p53</span> tumor-suppressor gene is defective or missing--cancer may ensue.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
