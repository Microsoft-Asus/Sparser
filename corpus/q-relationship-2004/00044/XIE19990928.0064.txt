UNITED NATIONS , September 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan Monday recommended the establishment of a 6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force to help implement a July accord aimed at ending an eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone .
In his latest report on the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone -LRB- UNOMSIL -RRB- , Annan said that he hoped the force would be able to incorporate a substantial number of troops from the Economic Community of West African States -LRB- ECOWAS -RRB- , whose own 12,000-member Nigerian -led military observer group called ECOMOG is being phased out after serving in Sierra Leone for two and half years .
Annan said that Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has agreed to his proposal to deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force which would include some Nigerian and other troops in the proposed force for Sierra Leone .
The July 7 agreement was signed in Lome , capital of Togo , by Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah and Corporal Foday Sankoh , head of the rebel Revolutionary United Front -LRB- RUF -RRB- .
The withdrawal of Nigerian troops , who make up the bulk of ECOMOG , began on August 31 , but was suspended following a meeting between the Nigerian and Sierra Leonean presidents , Annans said .
Annan said in his report that , without security , it would not be possible to carry out a program of disarming and demobilizing some 45,000 ex-combatants , many of them children , and thus remove a threat to the West African country 's stability .
Meanwhile , the U.N. chief also called for the immediate return to Sierra Leone of Sankoh , to `` assure important functions within the government of Sierra Leone . ''
Annan said that the commitment of Sankoh and his senior associates , including Johnny Paul Koroma , leader of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council , to the Lome agreement was an essential element in its effective implementation .
