 Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior

The gonads produce and secrete three major categories of steroid hormones: androgens, estrogens, and progestins (see FIGURE 45.13). All three types are found in both males and females but in different proportions. Produced in the testes of males and ovaries of females, these steroids affect growth and development and also regulate reproductive cycles and sexual behavior.

The testes primarily synthesize androgens, the main such hormone being testosterone. In general, androgens stimulate the development and maintenance of the male reproductive system. Androgens produced early in the development of an embryo determine that the fetus will develop as a male rather than a female. At puberty, high concentrations of androgens are responsible for the development of human male secondary sex characteristics, such as male patterns of hair growth and a low voice.

Estrogens, the most important of which is estradiol, have a parallel role in the maintenance of the female reproductive system and the development of female secondary sex characteristics. In mammals, progestins, which include progesterone, are primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus, which supports the growth and development of an embryo.

The synthesis of both estrogens and androgens is controlled by gonadotropins, FSH and LH, from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH and LH secretion is controlled by one releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). We will examine the complex feedback relationships that regulate the secretion of gonadal steroids in detail in Chapter 46. There we will see that the endocrine system is central not only to the survival of the individual but also to the propagation of the species.
