Under the treaty signed in February , Japanese fishing boats can now officially operate in the waters claimed by Russia .

Komura also said he hopes the treaty would ensure the safety of the Japanese fishing boats in the waters .
Russian patrols in the area have occasionally fired at the boats and arrested crewmen .
Territorial disputes over the Kuril islands have prevented the two countries from signing a World War II peace treaty .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japan 's former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto have pledged to reach an agreement on a treaty in the next two years .
