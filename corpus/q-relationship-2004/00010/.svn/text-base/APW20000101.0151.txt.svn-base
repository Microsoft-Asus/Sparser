NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- As freed hostages recovered from their eight-day hijacking nightmare , India 's foreign minister said today that their captors had wired their jet to explode and possibly kept extra weapons in the cargo hold .
Despite a joyful and relieved welcome for the 155 passengers and crew from the hijacked Indian Airlines jet , some predicted today that India would pay a heavy price for swapping the release of three Muslim militants for their freedom .
After receiving the three militants Friday , the hijackers fled the airport in Kandahar , Afghanistan , where they had been holding the plane , and disappeared into the desert .
Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban militia said today they had left the country .
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said the five hijackers were Pakistanis .
The identity of the hijackers -- who wore masks -- has not been clear , and Singh did not specify how he knew they were Pakistani .
Singh also said the five hijackers had crossed into southwestern Pakistan to the town of Quetta , citing information he said he received from a Taliban official .
The Taliban have not announced publicly which country the hijackers fled to .
There was no immediate reaction to the allegations from Pakistan .
Freed crew members said the plane had been wired with enough explosives to blow it up , Singh said .
A pilot who flew the hijacked plane back to India said on television that departure was delayed `` because there were explosives on board . ''
But the hijacked plane 's captain , Devi Sharan , told The Associated Press today he did not know about any explosives .
The hijackers may have also had AK47 automatic rifles , pistols and grenades hidden in the cargo hold `` from the beginning , '' he said .
On Dec. 26 , two days into the seizure , the hijackers got access to the cargo and suddenly appeared with more sophisticated weapons , Singh said .
With joy and tears , the freed hostages were welcomed back Friday evening by a huge crowd of relatives , friends and well-wishers at New Delhi 's international airport .
`` It was very suffocating inside .
I feel great to be able to look at the sun again , '' said Himanshu Sharma , 12 , who was held hostage with his parents and 9-year -old brother .
The only American hostage , Jeanne Moore of Bakersfield , Calif. , was in good health , said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Corwin .
`` We were scared a lot -- we never knew what was going to happen to us , '' Moore , a special education teacher , was quoted as saying in today 's Los Angeles Times .
`` It was a very interesting study in people . ''
Moore 's son , Jim , a Bakersfield police officer , left for India on Friday upon news of his mother 's release .
Kanwar Thukral , who had a childhood friend on board the flight , said he had mixed feelings about the Indian government 's decision to swap the militants for the hostages ' release .
`` I think releasing these prisoners will give a boost to the militant movement .
It will be a crutch for the militants .
They know now they can always hold the government hostage , '' Thukral said .
`` I guess the government had only one option .
But I still wish the militants had not been released . ''
In a New Year 's Eve message to the nation , Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said the deal was in the nation 's long-term interest .
`` India shall not spare any effort to thwart the phenomenon of terrorism , '' he said .
The issue of Kashmir is a focus of nationalist feeling in India .
The territory has been divided between India and Pakistan since independence in 1947 .
India has been battling Muslim insurgents in the part under its control , who demand either independence or union with Pakistan .
Masood Azhar , a leader of Harkat ul- Ansar , a group on a U.S. list of terrorist organizations , was the best known of the three men released .
In addition , the Indians freed Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar , chief commander of the rebel group Ul - Umar Mujahideen , and Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh , who was held in a New Delhi prison .
In the first three days of the hijacking , the passengers said , they were given half of an orange for breakfast and lunch .
Later , they were given hard bread .
The Indian Airlines plane was headed to New Delhi from Katmandu , Nepal , when the hijackers took control on Dec. 24 , carrying pistols , grenades and knives .
One Indian passenger was killed shortly after the plane was seized .
The plane hopped from Amritsar , India , to Lahore , Pakistan , to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates before finally landing in Kandahar on Christmas Day .
When it originally took off from Katmandu , the plane was carrying 178 passengers and 11 crew members .
The passengers included 150 Indians , eight Nepalese , one Canadian , one American , four Swiss , four Spaniards , one Belgian , one Japanese , one Australian , two French citizens and one Italian .
Four passengers were not listed by nationality .
Captors freed 27 hostages and unloaded Katyal 's body during the stopover in the Emirates , and another passenger had been released for medical reasons .
