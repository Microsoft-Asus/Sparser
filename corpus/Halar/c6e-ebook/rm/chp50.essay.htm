									<a name="para92"></a><p class="BlockText">Hiking up a mountain one day, you notice a plant species that has one growth form at low elevations and a very different growth form at high elevations. You wonder if these represent two genetically distinct populations of this species, each adapted to the prevailing conditions where they are found, or if this species has simply evolved the capacity for developmental flexibility and can assume either growth form, depending on local conditions. What experiments could you design to distinguish between these two hypotheses?</p>

									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">In pet shops throughout North America, you can purchase a variety of fishes, birds, and reptiles that do not originate from North America. Present scenarios in which such pet trade could endanger native plants and animals. Should governments regulate the pet trade? Are there currently any restrictions on what species a pet shop can sell in your city? How would you balance such regulation against a person’s individual rights?</p>
