WASHINGTON --
The Pentagon is making incomplete background investigations of a majority of its candidates for security clearance and has built up a backlog of over 500,000 cases , according to preliminary findings of a congressional investigation .
The problems uncovered at the Pentagon 's Defense Security Service , which conducts investigations of 120,000 defense employees and contractors each year , pose a threat to national security , according to the early draft report by the General Accounting Office , an investigating arm of Congress .
The preliminary findings have already prompted the Pentagon to remove the head of the agency , to begin altering its computer system and to institute new procedures .
In a sample of 531 cases , the General Accounting Office found that the Defense Security Service failed to make critical checks on 92 percent of the cases under review , according to a government official familiar with the early findings .
`` This has been a troubled agency , '' said Kenneth Bacon , the Pentagon spokesman .
`` The GAO report acknowledges we are on the road to solving the problem , but it is a big problem . ''
The investigation was initiated after a Pentagon lawyer was arrested and convicted in 1997 of spying for East Germany .
Even though Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to review the Pentagon 's security procedures , Rep. Ike Skelton , D - Mo. , asked for the independent review by the GAO .

<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Defense Security Service has lost nearly half of its staff since 1989 as part of the `` reinventing government '' initiative of the Clinton administration , a reduction from 4,080 to 2,466 people that several Defense Department officials say is part of the reason why the agency has failed to do thorough background investigations .</ENAMEX>
The Pentagon also acknowledges that the agency purchased a new computer system to streamline the investigations , but the equipment is so poorly designed that it breaks down routinely and has created the case backlog .
`` What the agency did in the name of efficiency instead created great inefficiency , '' Bacon said .
In June , the Pentagon appointed Gen. Charles Cunningham , a retired Air Force officer , to replace Steven Schanzer as head of the Defense Security Service .
In the past two months Cunningham has standardized investigations for security clearance , set up quality checks of those investigations and set up an academy to train agents in making security checks , the Pentagon said .
He has also brought in computer experts from the Air Force to sort out problems in the agency 's computer system and has asked for advice from the government 's Office of Personnel Management to help reduce the backlog of pending security clearances , according to Bacon .
The backlog of cases has grown so serious that the Pentagon is considering asking private security firms to help undertake the background investigations .
While Pentagon officials acknowledge responsibility for some of the problems at Defense Security Service , Bacon said that a 1996 presidential order requiring the review of all low and mid-level security clearances also helped create the backlog .
Under that provision , all government departments and agencies are to review the `` confidential '' clearances of their employees every 15 years and the higher level `` secret '' clearances every 10 years .
To meet this requirement the Pentagon is reviewing an additional 54,570 cases this year , according to a Defense Department official .
`` This explains some of the managerial confusion and the backlog , '' Bacon said .
At the same time , the Pentagon is reviewing whether the secret clearances are necessary at all .
The General Accounting Office declined to comment on the preliminary findings of their investigation .
The final report is due in October .
