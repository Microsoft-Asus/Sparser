When you pay home heating oil bills this winter , pump gasoline into the family car or buy airline tickets to a sunny climate , you will see just how much OPEC 's game of chicken is costing consumers .
With OPEC vowing to continue restraints on production , oil prices have begun surging again in the last two weeks .
The price of crude oil is now $ 29.20 a barrel and headed to $ 30 or more , say many commodity analysts .
Gasoline prices are at 77.33 cents a gallon in the futures market and heading to over $ 1.30 at the pump .
And the near-term home heating oil futures contract is up to 86.46 cents a gallon , after climbing 8.6 percent Thursday .
All these prices , except gasoline at the pump , are the highest since the run-up to the Persian Gulf war in January 1991 .
The price jumps are now spilling over into financial markets .
Concerns about oil 's impact on inflation have sent bond prices lower and yields higher .
Airline stocks have dropped sharply as fuel costs have risen .
Major airlines are now adding fuel surcharges of $ 10 each to their tickets .
The arctic air in the Midwest and Northeast is responsible for some of the increases .
But the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is really calling the shots .
Production cuts by the oil-producing nations last March caused crude oil prices to double in 1999 .
Then last week , OPEC officials said there was a consensus to extend current production cuts -- amounting to 4.3 million barrels a day below their levels a year earlier -- beyond the March expiration date .
So the question is , if the price of oil tops $ 30 a barrel , will OPEC keep squeezing ?
Or is it just talking tough ?
`` I do n't take any announcement as final , '' said Irene King , senior oil market analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities , referring to last week 's comments about extended production cuts .
`` But it is scary . ''
Two weeks ago , she said there was a 70 percent to 80 percent chance that OPEC officials would decide to increase crude oil production to ease price pressures when they meet at the end of March .
Now she says the odds are 50-50 .
If OPEC does not relent , the relatively low levels of oil inventories and strong demand mean that prices will move higher .
According to the Energy Information Administration and the American Petroleum Institute , total U.S. inventories of crude oil are now at their lowest level since the end of 1996 .
At the same time , demand in December was 19.8 million barrels a day , the highest for the month since 1978 .
The International Energy Agency forecast Thursday that worldwide demand will rise 2.4 percent this year , the biggest gain since 1997 , as global economic growth continues to pick up .
Because of OPEC production cuts last year , crude oil inventories , excluding the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve , fell in the week ended Jan. 14 to 293.3 million barrels , from 324 million barrels a year earlier , according to the EIA. The API figures are about the same .
Gasoline supplies are tight , having dropped below 200 million barrels to 198.3 million barrels , from 222.6 million barrels a year ago .
Distillate stocks , which include home heating oil , are also low , having fallen to 118.8 million barrels from 152.6 million barrels .
Ms. King is most worried about the low gasoline stocks as refineries head into a period when they normally shut down for four to six weeks for maintenance and upgrades .
She said that if inventories remained at these low levels in the spring , `` then we are in trouble . ''
That 's because demand for gasoline picks up drastically during the peak summer travel season .
Trouble could mean gasoline lines , she said .
But , `` that is the extreme case , '' she noted .
`` I do n't think we are going to get there . ''
Despite last week 's comments from OPEC , many analysts do not expect OPEC officials to risk pushing the price of oil too far above $ 30 a barrel .
If the price goes higher , leaders of the United States , Europe and Asia may well begin to fret about the possible impact on their economies .
`` I 'm concerned about the increase in oil prices , and I 'm going to be discussing this with my counterpart ministers from Saudi Arabia , Norway , Mexico and Venezuela very soon , '' the secretary of energy , Bill Richardson , said Wednesday .
So what OPEC probably wants to do is orchestrate a soft-landing for the price of oil .
That means the group needs to talk tough for a while longer .
Holding out would reduce inventories further as oil is bought in anticipation of higher prices .
With lower inventories , the downdraft in oil prices would be much weaker if OPEC increases production .
Last week , some OPEC officials said worldwide inventories of crude oil were not yet low enough .
`` They do n't want people to anticipate production increases , '' said Michael Rothman , senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch .
`` They do n't want a production increase to lead to a crash in the oil price . ''
Frederick Leuffer , senior energy analyst at Bear , Stearns & Co. , said crude inventories were so low now that OPEC would have to increase production to prevent prices from skyrocketing and the threat of gasoline lines .
`` We 're within two days of what the industry considers a minimal operational level , '' which is crude oil inventories equal to 12 to 13 days of demand .
`` If inventories decline from this level , OPEC wo n't be able to do what they say they will do , '' Leuffer argued .
`` This is simply an effort to talk up the price .
The last thing they want to do is alienate consumers and force governments to dip into strategic petroleum reserves . ''
Some analysts expect Saudi Arabia to take the lead in pushing for a March agreement that will ease price pressures .
Because there is no agreement yet on how long to extend the production cuts , there is room to maneuver .
For now at least , Saudi Arabia is talking tough .
But some see political motivations for it to do so .
Any switch to supporting lower oil prices now could undermine the chances of victory for the moderates in the Iranian elections in February , these analysts say .
Politicians in the United States , meanwhile , are beginning to squawk about the higher prices .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , wants the government to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help push prices lower .
`` They have been saying that OPEC would relent for months , '' Schumer said .
`` The best way to jawbone them is to say that we are going to sell some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . ''
This all means that crude oil , gasoline and home heating oil prices are going to be higher than anyone expected just two weeks ago .
And that raises a bigger question : When will the American consumer get mad ?
Probably pretty soon .
Gasoline pump prices have risen much more slowly than crude oil or the cost of gasoline before taxes are added in .
But at $ 1.27 an unleaded gallon Thursday , the average countrywide price is just a penny away from its 1996 high .
