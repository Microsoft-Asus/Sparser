Life on Earth is solar powered. The chloroplasts of plants capture light energy that has traveled 160 million kilometers from the sun and convert it to chemical energy stored in sugar and other organic molecules. The conversion process is called photosynthesis. In this chapter, you will learn how photosynthesis works. We begin by placing photosynthesis in its ecological context.

 Plants and other autotrophs are the producers of the biosphere

Photosynthesis nourishes almost all of the living world directly or indirectly. An organism acquires the organic compounds it uses for energy and carbon skeletons by one of two major modes: autotrophic or heterotrophic nutrition. At first, the term autotrophic (from the Greek autos, self, and trophos, feed) may seem to contradict the principle that organisms are open systems, taking in resources from their environment. Autotrophs are not totally self-sufficient, however; they are self-feeders only in the sense that they sustain themselves without eating other organisms or substances derived from other organisms. Autotrophs produce their organic molecules from CO2 and other inorganic raw materials obtained from the environment and are the ultimate sources of organic compounds for all nonautotrophic organisms. For this reason, biologists refer to autotrophs as the producers of the biosphere (the global ecosystem).

Plants are autotrophs; the only nutrients they require are carbon dioxide from the air, and water and minerals from the soil. Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, organisms that use light as a source of energy to synthesize organic substances. Photosynthesis also occurs in algae, including certain protists, and in some prokaryotes (FIGURE 10.1). In this chapter, our emphasis will be on plants. Variations in photosynthesis that occur in algae and bacteria will be discussed in Unit Five. A much rarer form of self-feeding is unique to those bacteria that are chemoautotrophs. These organisms produce their organic compounds without the help of light, obtaining their energy by oxidizing inorganic substances, such as sulfur or ammonia. (We will postpone further discussion of this type of autotrophic nutrition until Chapter 27.)

Fig 10-1. Photoautotrophs. These organisms use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic molecules from carbon dioxide and (in most cases) water. They feed not only themselves, but the entire living world. (a) On land, plants are the predominant producers of food. Three major groups of land plants--mosses, ferns, and flowering plants--are represented in this scene. In oceans, ponds, lakes, and other aquatic environments, photosynthetic organisms include (b) multicellular algae, such as this kelp; (c) some unicellular protists, such as Euglena;(d) the prokaryotes called cyanobacteria; and (e) other photosynthetic prokaryotes, such as these purple sulfur bacteria (c, d, e: LMs).

Heterotrophs obtain their organic material by the second major mode of nutrition. Unable to make their own food, they live on compounds produced by other organisms; heterotrophs are the biosphere's consumers. The most obvious form of this "other-feeding" (hetero means "other, different") occurs when an animal eats plants or other animals. But heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle. Some heterotrophs consume the remains of dead organisms, decomposing and feeding on organic litter such as carcasses, feces, and fallen leaves; they are known as decomposers. Most fungi and many types of bacteria get their nourishment this way. Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent on photoautotrophs for food, and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis. Thus, we can trace the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe to the chloroplast.





 Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants

All green parts of a plant, including green stems and unripened fruit, have chloroplasts, but the leaves are the major sites of photosynthesis in most plants (FIGURE 10.2). There are about half a million chloroplasts per square millimeter of leaf surface. The color of the leaf is from chlorophyll, the green pigment located within the chloroplasts. It is the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll that drives the synthesis of food molecules in the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are found mainly in the cells of the mesophyll, the tissue in the interior of the leaf. Carbon dioxide enters the leaf, and oxygen exits, by way of microscopic pores called stomata (singular, stoma; from the Greek, meaning "mouth"). Water absorbed by the roots is delivered to the leaves in veins. Leaves also use veins to export sugar to roots and other nonphotosynthetic parts of the plant.

Fig 10-2. Focusing in on the location of photosynthesis in a plant. Leaves are the major organs of photosynthesis in plants. These pictures take you into a leaf, then into a cell, and finally into a chloroplast, the organelle where photosynthesis occurs. Gas exchange between the leaf's mesophyll tissue and the atmosphere occurs through microscopic pores called stomata. Chloroplasts, found mainly in the mesophyll, are bounded by two membranes that enclose the stroma, a dense fluid. Membranes of the thylakoid system separate the stroma from the thylakoid space. Thylakoids are concentrated in stacks called grana. (Middle right, LM; bottom right, TEM.)

A typical mesophyll cell has about 30 to 40 chloroplasts, each a watermelon-shaped organelle measuring about 2-4 mm by 4-7 mm. An envelope of two membranes encloses the stroma, the dense fluid within the chloroplast. An elaborate system of interconnected thylakoid membranes segregates the stroma from another compartment, the thylakoid space (or lumen). In some places, thylakoid sacs are stacked in columns called grana. Chlorophyll resides in the thylakoid membranes. (Photosynthetic prokaryotes lack chloroplasts; but as you will see in Chapter 27, they do have membranes that function in a manner similar to the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.) Now that we have looked at the sites of photosynthesis in plants, we are ready to see how these organelles convert the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll to chemical energy.





 Evidence that chloroplasts split water molecules enabled researchers to track atoms through photosynthesis

Scientists have tried for centuries to piece together the process by which plants make food. Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Using molecular formulas, we can summarize photosynthesis with this chemical equation: 
The carbohydrate C6H12O6 is glucose.* Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water: 
Writing the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration. Both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, plants do not make food by simply reversing the steps of respiration.

Now let's divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form: 
Here, CH2O is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate. In other words, we are imagining the synthesis of a sugar molecule one carbon at a time. Six repetitions would produce a glucose molecule. Let's now use this simplified formula to see how researchers tracked the chemical elements (C, H, and O) from the reactants of photosynthesis to the products.

The Splitting of Water

One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the oxygen given off by plants is derived from water and not from carbon dioxide. The chloroplast splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Before this discovery, the prevailing hypothesis was that photosynthesis split carbon dioxide and then added water to the carbon. 
This hypothesis predicted that the O2 released during photosynthesis came from CO2. This idea was challenged in the 1930s by C. B. van Niel of Stanford University. Van Niel was investigating photosynthesis in bacteria that make their carbohydrate from CO2 but do not release O2. Van Niel concluded that, at least in these bacteria, CO2 is not split into carbon and oxygen. One group of bacteria used hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rather than water for photosynthesis, forming yellow globules of sulfur as a waste product (these globules are visible in FIGURE 10.1e). Here is the chemical equation: 
Van Niel reasoned that the bacteria split H2S and used the hydrogen to make sugar. He then generalized that idea, proposing that all photosynthetic organisms require a hydrogen source, but that the source varies: 
Thus, van Niel hypothesized that plants split water as a source of hydrogen, releasing oxygen as a by-product.

Nearly 20 years later, scientists confirmed van Niel's hypothesis by using oxygen-18 (18O), a heavy isotope, as a tracer to follow the fate of oxygen atoms during photosynthesis. The O2 that came from plants was labeled with 18O only if water was the source of the tracer. If the 18O was introduced to the plant in the form of CO2, the label did not turn up in the released O2. In the following summary of these experiments, red denotes labeled atoms of oxygen: 
The most important result of the shuffling of atoms during photosynthesis is the extraction of hydrogen from water and its incorporation into sugar. The waste product of photosynthesis, O2, restores the atmospheric oxygen consumed during cellular respiration. FIGURE 10.3 shows the fates of all atoms in photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis as a Redox Process

Let's briefly contrast photosynthesis with cellular respiration. During respiration, energy is released from sugar when electrons associated with hydrogen are transported by carriers to oxygen, forming water as a by-product. The electrons lose potential energy as they are pulled down the electron transport chain to electronegative oxygen, and the mitochondrion uses the energy to synthesize ATP. Photosynthesis, also a redox process, reverses the direction of electron flow. Water is split, and electrons are transferred along with hydrogen ions from the water to carbon dioxide, reducing it to sugar. The electrons increase in potential energy as they move from water to sugar. The required energy boost is provided by light.





 The light reactions and the Calvin cycle cooperate in converting light energy to the chemical energy of food: an overview

The equation for photosynthesis is a deceptively simple summary of a very complex process. Actually, photosynthesis is not a single process, but two processes, each with multiple steps. These two stages of photosynthesis are known as the light reactions (the photo part of photosynthesis) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis part) (FIGURE 10.4).

Fig 10-4. An overview of photosynthesis: cooperation of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the chloroplast, the thylakoid membranes are the sites of the light reactions, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. The light reactions use solar energy to make ATP and NADPH, which function as chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, in the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle incorporates CO2 into organic molecules, which are converted to sugar. (Recall from Chapter 5 that most simple sugars have formulas that are some multiple of CH2O.)

The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of electrons and hydrogen from water to an acceptor called NADP+1 (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which temporarily stores the energized electrons. Water is split in the process, and thus it is the light reactions of photosynthesis that give off O2 as a by-product. The electron acceptor of the light reactions, NADP+, is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with a hydrogen nucleus, or H+. The light reactions also generate ATP by powering the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of energized electrons ("reducing power"), and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.

The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired energized electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions regenerate the NADPH and ATP spent in the reduction of CO2 to sugar. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.

As FIGURE 10.4 indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. As molecules of NADP+ and ADP bump into the thylakoid membrane, they pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and then transfer their high-energy cargo to the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. Our next step toward understanding photosynthesis is to look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.





 The light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH: a closer look

Chloroplasts are chemical factories powered by the sun. Their thylakoids transform light energy into the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH. To understand this conversion better, it is necessary to know about some important properties of light.

The Nature of Sunlight

Light is a form of energy known as electromagnetic energy, also called electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic energy travels in rhythmic waves analogous to those created by dropping a pebble into a puddle of water. Electromagnetic waves, however, are disturbances of electrical and magnetic fields rather than disturbances of a material medium such as water.

The distance between the crests of electromagnetic waves is called the wavelength. Wavelengths range from less than a nanometer (for gamma rays) to more than a kilometer (for radio waves). This entire range of radiation is known as the electromagnetic spectrum (FIGURE 10.5). The segment most important to life is the narrow band that ranges from about 380 to 750 nm in wavelength. This radiation is known as visible light, because it is detected as various colors by the human eye.

Fig 10-5. The electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic energy radiate through space as waves of various lengths. We perceive different wavelengths of visible light, which range from about 380 to 750 nm, as different colors. White light is a mixture of all wavelengths of visible light. A prism can sort white light into its component colors by bending light of different wavelengths at different angles. Visible light drives photosynthesis.

The model of light as waves explains many of light's properties, but in certain respects light behaves as though it consists of discrete particles, called photons. Photons are not tangible objects, but they act like objects in that each of them has a fixed quantity of energy. The amount of energy is inversely related to the wavelength of the light; the shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy of each photon of that light. Thus, a photon of violet light packs nearly twice as much energy as a photon of red light.

Although the sun radiates the full spectrum of electro magnetic energy, the atmosphere acts like a selective window, allowing visible light to pass through while screening out a substantial fraction of other radiation. The part of the spectrum we can see--visible light--is also the radiation that drives photosynthesis.

Photosynthetic Pigments: The Light Receptors

As light meets matter, it may be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed. Substances that absorb visible light are called pigments. Different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths, and the wavelengths that are absorbed disappear. If a pigment is illuminated with white light, the color we see is the color most reflected or transmitted by the pigment. (If a pigment absorbs all wavelengths, it appears black.) We see green when we look at a leaf because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light while transmitting and reflecting green light (FIGURE 10.6). The ability of a pigment to absorb various wavelengths of light can be measured with an instrument called a spectrophotometer. This machine directs beams of light of different wavelengths through a solution of the pigment and measures the fraction of the light transmitted at each wavelength (FIGURE 10.7). A graph plotting a pigment's light absorption (the fraction not transmitted or reflected) versus wavelength is called an absorption spectrum.

Fig 10-6. Why leaves are green: interaction of light with chloroplasts. The pigment molecules of chloroplasts absorb blue and red light and reflect or transmit green light. This is why leaves appear green. It turns out that blue and red are the colors of light most effective in photosynthesis.

Fig 10-7. Determining an absorption spectrum. A spectrophotometer measures the relative amounts of light of different wavelengths absorbed and transmitted by a pigment solution. Inside the spectrophotometer, white light is separated into colors (wavelengths) by a prism. Then, one by one, the different colors of light are passed through the sample. The transmitted light strikes a photoelectric tube, which converts the light energy to electricity, and the electrical current is measured by a galvanometer. Each time the wavelength of light is changed, the meter indicates the fraction of light transmitted through the sample (or, conversely, the fraction of light absorbed). This figure shows the transmittance reading on the meter when (a) green light and then (b) blue light are passed through a chlorophyll solution.

The absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide clues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths for driving photosynthesis, since light can perform work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed. FIGURE 10.8 a shows the absorption spectra of a type of chlorophyll called chlorophyll a and some other pigments in the chloroplast. If we look first at the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a, it suggests that blue and red light work best for photosynthesis, while green is the least effective color. This is confirmed by an action spectrum for photosynthesis (FIGURE 10.8b), which profiles the relative performance of the different wavelengths. An action spectrum is prepared by illuminating chloroplasts with different colors of light and then plotting wavelength against some measure of photosynthetic rate, such as carbon dioxide consumption or oxygen release. The action spectrum for photosynthesis was first demonstrated in 1883 in an elegant experiment performed by the German botanist Thomas Engelmann, who used bacteria to measure rates of photosynthesis in filamentous algae (FIGURE 10.8c).

Fig 10-8. Evidence that chloroplast pigments participate in photosynthesis: absorption and action spectra for photosynthesis in an alga.

Notice by comparing FIGURES 10.8a and 10.8b that the action spectrum for photosynthesis does not exactly match the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a. The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a alone underestimates the effectiveness of certain wavelengths in driving photosynthesis. This is partly because chlorophyll a is not the only photosynthetically important pigment in chloroplasts. Only chlorophyll a can participate directly in the light reactions, which convert solar energy to chemical energy. But other pigments in the thylakoid membrane can absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a, which then initiates the light reactions. One of these accessory pigments is another form of chlorophyll, chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll b is almost identical to chlorophyll a (see FIGURE 10.9 on page 184), but a slight structural difference between them is enough to give the two pigments slightly different absorption spectra and hence different colors. Chlorophyll a is blue-green, whereas chlorophyll b is yellow-green. If a photon of sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll b, energy is conveyed to chlorophyll a, which then behaves just as though it had absorbed the photon. Other accessory pigments include carotenoids, hydrocarbons that are various shades of yellow and orange (see FIGURE 10.8a). Carotenoids may broaden the spectrum of colors that can drive photosynthesis. However, a more important function of at least some carotenoids seems to be photoprotection: Rather than transmit energy to chlorophyll, these compounds absorb and dissipate excessive light energy that would otherwise damage chlorophyll. (Interestingly, carotenoids similar to the photoprotective ones in chloroplasts have a photoprotective role in the human eye.)

Fig 10-9. Location and structure of chlorophyll molecules in plants. A plant's chlorophyll molecules, along with accessory pigment molecules, are immersed in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, in association with protein (purple). Chlorophyll a, the pigment that participates directly in the light reactions of photosynthesis, has a "head," called a porphyrin ring, with a magnesium atom at its center. Attached to the porphyrin is a hydrocarbon tail, which interacts with hydrophobic regions of proteins inside the thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll b differs from chlorophyll a only in one of the functional groups bonded to the porphyrin.

Excitation of Chlorophyll by Light

What exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb photons? The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon, one of the molecule's electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. After absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, the pigment molecule is said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of atom or molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum.

Photons are absorbed by clusters of pigment molecules embedded in the thylakoid membrane (FIGURE 10.9). The energy of an absorbed photon is converted to the potential energy of an electron raised from the ground state to an excited state. But the electron cannot remain there long; the excited state, like all high-energy states, is unstable. Generally, when pigments absorb light, their excited electrons drop back down to the ground-state orbital in a billionth of a second, releasing their excess energy as heat. This conversion of light energy to heat is what makes the top of an automobile so hot on a sunny day. (White cars are coolest because their paint reflects all wavelengths of visible light, although it may absorb ultraviolet and other invisible radiation.) Some pigments, including chlorophyll, emit light as well as heat after absorbing photons. The electron jumps to a state of greater energy, and as it falls back to ground state, a photon is given off. This afterglow is called fluorescence. If a solution of chlorophyll isolated from chloroplasts is illuminated, it will fluoresce in the red part of the spectrum and also give off heat (FIGURE 10.10).

Fig 10-10. Excitation of isolated chlorophyll by light. (a) Absorption of a photon causes a transition of the chlorophyll molecule from its ground state to its excited state. The photon boosts an electron to an orbital where it has more potential energy. If the illuminated molecule exists in isolation, its excited electron immediately drops back down to the ground-state orbital, and its excess energy is given off as heat and fluorescence (light). (b) A chlorophyll solution excited with ultraviolet light will fluoresce with a red-orange glow.

Photosystems: Light-Harvesting Complexes of the Thylakoid Membrane

Chlorophyll excited by absorption of light energy produces very different results in an intact chloroplast than it does in isolation. In its native environment of the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll is organized along with proteins and other kinds of smaller organic molecules into photosystems.

A photosystem has a light-gathering "antenna complex" consisting of a cluster of a few hundred chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid molecules (FIGURE 10.11). The number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface and a larger portion of the spectrum than any single pigment molecule could harvest. When any antenna molecule absorbs a photon, the energy is transmitted from pigment molecule to pigment molecule until it reaches a particular chlorophyll a. What is special about this chlorophyll a molecule is not its molecular structure, but its position. Only this chlorophyll molecule is located in the region of the photosystem called the reaction center, where the first light-driven chemical reaction of photosynthesis occurs.

Fig 10-11. How a photosystem harvests light. Photosystems are the light-harvesting units of the thylakoid membrane. Each photosystem is a complex of proteins and other kinds of molecules and includes an antenna consisting of a few hundred pigment molecules. When a photon strikes a pigment molecule, the energy is passed from molecule to molecule until it reaches the reaction center. At the reaction center, an excited electron from the reaction-center chlorophyll is captured by a specialized molecule called the primary electron acceptor.

Sharing the reaction center with the chlorophyll a molecule is a specialized molecule called the primary electron acceptor. In an oxidation-reduction reaction, the chlorophyll a molecule at the reaction center loses one of its electrons to the primary electron acceptor. This redox reaction occurs when light excites the electron to a higher energy level in chlorophyll and the electron acceptor traps the high-energy electron before it can return to the ground state in the chlorophyll molecule. Isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor to prevent electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll from dropping right back to the ground state. In a chloroplast, the acceptor molecule functions like a dam that prevents this immediate plunge of high-energy electrons back to the ground state. Thus, each photosystem--reaction-center chlorophyll and primary electron acceptor surrounded by an antenna complex--functions in the chloroplast as a light-harvesting unit. The solar-powered transfer of electrons from chlorophyll to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions.

The thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are called photosystem I and photosystem II, in order of their discovery. Each has a characteristic reaction center--a particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a chlorophyll a molecule associated with specific proteins. The reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I is known as P700 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 700 nm (the far-red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll at the reaction center of photosystem II is called P680 because its absorption spectrum has a peak at 680 nm (also in the red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P700 and P680, are actually identical chlorophyll a molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane affects the electron distribution in the chlorophyll molecules and accounts for the slight differences in light-absorbing properties. Now let's see how the two photosystems work together in using light energy to generate ATP and NADPH, the two main products of the light reactions.

Noncyclic Electron Flow

Light drives the synthesis of NADPH and ATP by energizing the two photosystems embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The key to this energy transformation is a flow of electrons through the photosystems and other molecular components built into the thylakoid membrane. During the light reactions of photosynthesis, there are two possible routes for electron flow: cyclic and noncyclic. Noncyclic electron flow, the predominant route, is shown in FIGURE 10.12 on p. 186 The numbers in the text description correspond to the numbered steps in the figure.

Fig 10-12. How noncyclic electron flow during the light reactions generates ATP and NADPH. The gold arrows trace the current of light-driven electrons from water to NADPH. Each photon of light excites a single electron, but the diagram tracks two electrons at a time, the number of electrons required to reduce NADP+. The numbered steps are described in the text.

The energy changes of electrons as they flow through the light reactions are analogous to the cartoon in FIGURE 10.13. As complicated as the scheme is, do not lose track of its functions: The light reactions use solar power to generate ATP and NADPH, which provide chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, to the sugar-making reactions of the Calvin cycle.

Fig 10-13. A mechanical analogy for the light reactions.

Cyclic Electron Flow

Under certain conditions, photoexcited electrons take an alternative path called cyclic electron flow, which uses photosystem I but not photosystem II. You can see in FIGURE 10.14 that cyclic flow is a short circuit: The electrons cycle back from ferredoxin (Fd) to the cytochrome complex and from there continue on to the P700 chlorophyll. There is no production of NADPH and no release of oxygen. Cyclic flow does, however, generate ATP. This is called cyclic photophosphorylation, to distinguish it from noncyclic photophosphorylation.

Fig 10-14. Cyclic electron flow. Photoexcited electrons from photosystem I are occasionally shunted back from ferredoxin (Fd) to chlorophyll via the cytochrome complex and plastocyanin (Pc). This electron shunt supplements the supply of ATP but produces no NADPH. The "shadow" of noncyclic electron flow is included in the diagram for comparison with the cyclic route. The two ferredoxin molecules shown in this diagram are actually one and the same--the final electron carrier in the electron transport chain of photosystem I.

What is the function of cyclic electron flow? Noncyclic electron flow produces ATP and NADPH in roughly equal quantities, but the Calvin cycle consumes more ATP than NADPH. Cyclic electron flow makes up the difference. The concentration of NADPH in the chloroplast may help regulate which pathway, cyclic versus noncyclic, electrons take through the light reactions. If the chloroplast runs low on ATP for the Calvin cycle, NADPH will begin to accumulate as the Calvin cycle slows down. The rise in NADPH may stimulate a temporary shift from noncyclic to cyclic electron flow until ATP supply catches up with demand.

Whether photophosphorylation is driven by noncyclic or cyclic electron flow, the actual mechanism for ATP synthesis is the same. This is a good time to review chemiosmosis, the process that uses membranes to couple redox reactions to ATP production.

A Comparison of Chemiosmosis in Chloroplasts and Mitochondria

Chloroplasts and mitochondria generate ATP by the same basic mechanism: chemiosmosis. An electron transport chain assembled in a membrane pumps protons across the membrane as electrons are passed through a series of carriers that are progressively more electronegative. In this way, electron transport chains transform redox energy to a proton-motive force, potential energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane. Built into the same membrane is an ATP synthase complex that couples the diffusion of hydrogen ions down their gradient to the phosphorylation of ADP. Some of the electron carriers, including the iron-containing proteins called cytochromes, are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The ATP synthase complexes of the two organelles are also very much alike. But there are noteworthy differences between oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and photophosphorylation in chloroplasts. In mitochondria, the high-energy electrons dropped down the transport chain are extracted from food molecules (which are thus oxidized). Chloroplasts do not need food to make ATP; their photosystems capture light energy and use it to drive electrons to the top of the transport chain. In other words, mitochondria transfer chemical energy from food molecules to ATP, whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy.

The spatial organization of chemiosmosis also differs in chloroplasts and mitochondria (FIGURE 10.15). The inner membrane of the mitochondrion pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix out to the intermembrane space, which then serves as a reservoir of hydrogen ions that powers the ATP synthase. The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space, which functions as the H+ reservoir. The thylakoid membrane makes ATP as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through ATP synthase complexes, whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane. Thus, ATP forms in the stroma, where it is used to help drive sugar synthesis during the Calvin cycle.

Fig 10-15. Comparison of chemiosmosis in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In both kinds of organelles, electron transport chains pump protons (H+) across a membrane from a region of low H+ concentration (light brown in this diagram) to one of high H+ concentration (darker brown). The protons then diffuse back across the membrane through ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP. The diagram identifies the regions of high and low H+ concentration in the two organelles.

The proton gradient, or pH gradient, across the thylakoid membrane is substantial. When chloroplasts are illuminated, the pH in the thylakoid space drops to about 5, and the pH in the stroma increases to about 8. This gradient of three pH units corresponds to a thousandfold difference in H+ concentration. If in the laboratory the lights are turned off, the pH gradient is abolished, but it can quickly be restored by turning the lights back on. Such experiments add to the evidence described in Chapter 9 in support of the chemiosmotic model.

Based on studies in several laboratories, FIGURE 10.16 shows a current model for the organization of the light-reaction "machinery" within the thylakoid membrane. Each of the molecules and molecular complexes in the figure is present in numerous copies in each thylakoid. Notice that NADPH, like ATP, is produced on the side of the membrane facing the stroma, where the Calvin cycle reactions take place.

Fig 10-16. The light reactions and chemiosmosis: the organization of the thylakoid membrane. This diagram shows a current model for the organization of the thylakoid membrane. The gold arrows track the noncyclic electron flow outlined in FIGURE 10.12. As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, hydrogen ions removed from the stroma are deposited in the thylakoid space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient). At least three steps in the light reactions contribute to the proton gradient: 
			  
		 Water is split by photosystem II on the side of the membrane facing the thylakoid space; 
			  
		 as plastoquinone (Pq), a mobile carrier, transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex, protons are translocated across the membrane; and 
			  
		 a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by NADP+. The diffusion of H+ from the thylakoid space to the stroma (along the H+ concentration gradient) powers the ATP synthase. These light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the sugar-producing Calvin cycle.

Let's summarize the light reactions. Noncyclic electron flow pushes electrons from water, where they are at a low state of potential energy, to NADPH, where they are stored at a high state of potential energy. The light-driven electron current also generates ATP. Thus, the equipment of the thylakoid membrane converts light energy to the chemical energy stored in NADPH and ATP. (Oxygen is a by-product.) Let's now see how the Calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to synthesize sugar from CO2.





 The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 to sugar: a closer look

The Calvin cycle is a metabolic pathway similar to the Krebs cycle in that a starting material is regenerated after molecules enter and leave the cycle. Carbon enters the Calvin cycle in the form of CO2 and leaves in the form of sugar. The cycle spends ATP as an energy source and consumes NADPH as reducing power for adding high-energy electrons to make the sugar.

The carbohydrate produced directly from the Calvin cycle is actually not glucose, but a three-carbon sugar named glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). For the net synthesis of one molecule of this sugar, the cycle must take place three times, fixing three molecules of CO2. (Recall that carbon fixation refers to the initial incorporation of CO2 into organic material.) As we trace the steps of the cycle, keep in mind that we are following three molecules of CO2 through the reactions. FIGURE 10.17 divides the Calvin cycle into three phases :

Fig 10-17. The Calvin cycle. This diagram tracks carbon atoms (gray balls) through the cycle. The three phases of the cycle correspond to the phases discussed in the text. For every three molecules of CO2 that enter the cycle, the net output is one molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon sugar. For each G3P synthesized, the cycle spends nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH. The light reactions sustain the Calvin cycle by regenerating ATP and NADPH.

Phase 1: Carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle incorporates each CO2 molecule by attaching it to a five-carbon sugar named ribulose bisphosphate (abbreviated RuBP). The enzyme that catalyzes this first step is RuBP carboxylase, or rubisco. (It is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and probably the most abundant protein on Earth.) The product of the reaction is a six-carbon intermediate so unstable that it immediately splits in half to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (for each CO2).

Phase 2: Reduction. Each molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate receives an additional phosphate group from ATP, becoming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Next, a pair of electrons donated from NADPH reduces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to G3P. Specifically, the electrons from NADPH reduce the carboyxl group of 3-phosphoglycerate to the carbonyl group of G3P, which stores more potential energy. G3P is a sugar--the same three-carbon sugar formed in glycolysis by the splitting of glucose. Notice in FIGURE 10.17 that for every three molecules of CO2, there are six molecules of G3P. But only one molecule of this three-carbon sugar can be counted as a net gain of carbohydrate. The cycle began with 15 carbons' worth of carbohydrate in the form of three molecules of the five-carbon sugar RuBP. Now there are 18 carbons' worth of carbohydrate in the form of six molecules of G3P. One molecule exits the cycle to be used by the plant cell, but the other five molecules must be recycled to regenerate the three molecules of RuBP.

Phase 3: Regeneration of CO2 acceptor (RuBP). In a complex series of reactions, the carbon skeletons of five molecules of G3P are rearranged by the last steps of the Calvin cycle into three molecules of RuBP. To accomplish this, the cycle spends three more molecules of ATP. The RuBP is now prepared to receive CO2 again, and the cycle continues.

For the net synthesis of one G3P molecule, the Calvin cycle consumes a total of nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH. The light reactions regenerate the ATP and NADPH. The G3P spun off from the Calvin cycle becomes the starting material for metabolic pathways that synthesize other organic compounds, including glucose and other carbohydrates. Neither the light reactions nor the Calvin cycle alone can make sugar from CO2. Photosynthesis is an emergent property of the intact chloroplast, which integrates the two stages of photosynthesis.





 Alternative mechanisms of carbon fixation have evolved in hot, arid climates

Ever since plants first moved onto land about 425 million years ago, they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life, particularly the problem of dehydration. In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water. Here we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores through the leaf surface (see FIGURE 10.2). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water. This response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to CO2. With stomata even partially closed, CO2 concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf, and the concentration of O2 released from photosynthesis begins to increase. These conditions within the leaf favor a seemingly wasteful process called photorespiration.

Photorespiration: An Evolutionary Relic?

In most plants, initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco, the Calvin cycle enzyme that adds CO2 to ribulose bisphosphate. Such plants are called C3 plants because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (see FIGURE 10.17). Rice, wheat, and soybeans are among the C3 plants that are important in agriculture. These plants produce less food when their stomata close on hot, dry days. The declining level of CO2 in the leaf starves the Calvin cycle. Making matters worse, rubisco can accept O2 in place of CO2. As O2 concentrations overtake CO2 concentrations within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and one piece, a two-carbon compound, is exported from the chloroplast. Mitochondria and peroxisomes then break the two-carbon molecule down to CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, photorespiration generates no ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no food. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle.

How can we explain the existence of a metabolic process that seems to be counterproductive to the plant? According to one hypothesis, photorespiration is evolutionary baggage--a metabolic relic from a much earlier time, when the atmosphere had less O2 and more CO2 than it does today. In the ancient atmosphere present when rubisco first evolved, the inability of the enzyme's active site to exclude O2 would have made little difference. The hypothesis speculates that modern rubisco retains some of its ancestral affinity for O2, which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable.

It is not known whether photorespiration is beneficial to plants in any way. It is known that in many types of plants--including some of agricultural importance, such as soybeans--photorespiration drains away as much as 50%  of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. As heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food, we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful. Indeed, if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity, crop yields and food supplies would increase.

The environmental conditions that foster photorespiration are hot, dry, bright days--the conditions that cause stomata to close. In certain plant species, alternate modes of carbon fixation that minimize photorespiration--even in hot, arid climates--have evolved. The two most important of these photosynthetic adaptations are C4 photosynthesis and CAM.

C4 Plants

The C4 plants are so named because they preface the Calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a four-carbon compound as its first product. Several thousand species in at least 19 plant families use the C4 pathway. Among the C4 plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn, members of the grass family.

A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (FIGURE 10.18; compare withFIGURE 10.2). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath. However, the cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll. The first step is the addition of CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. The enzyme PEP carboxylase adds CO2 to PEP. Compared to rubisco, PEP carboxylase has a very high affinity for CO2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix CO2 efficiently when rubisco cannot--that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in FIGURE 10.18) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see FIGURE 7.28). Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle.

Fig 10-18. C4 leaf anatomy and the C4 pathway. The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C4 plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates. This adaptation maintains a CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath that favors photosynthesis over photorespiration.

In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to accept carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. In this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.

CAM Plants

A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in succulent (water-storing) plants (including ice plants), many cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.

Notice in FIGURE 10.19 that the CAM pathway is similar to the C4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C4 plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times. (Keep in mind that CAM, C4, and C3 plants all eventually use the Calvin cycle to make sugar from carbon dioxide.)

 Photosynthesis is the biosphere's metabolic foundation: a review

In this chapter, we have followed photosynthesis from photons to food. The light reactions capture solar energy and use it to make ATP and transfer electrons from water to NADP+. The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH to produce sugar from carbon dioxide. The energy that enters the chloroplasts as sunlight becomes stored as chemical energy in organic compounds. See FIGURE 10.20 on page 194 for a review of the entire process.

Fig 10-20. A review of photosynthesis. This diagram outlines the main reactants and products of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle as they occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The entire ordered operation depends on the structural integrity of the chloroplast and its membranes. Enzymes in the chloroplast and cytosol convert glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), the direct product of the Calvin cycle, into many other organic compounds.

What are the fates of photosynthetic products? The sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons to synthesize all the major organic molecules of cells. About 50%  of the organic material made by photosynthesis is consumed as fuel for cellular respiration in the mitochondria of the plant cells. Sometimes there is a loss of photosynthetic products to photorespiration.

Technically, green cells are the only autotrophic parts of the plant. The rest of the plant depends on organic molecules exported from leaves via veins. In most plants, carbohydrate is transported out of the leaves in the form of sucrose, a disaccharide. After arriving at nonphotosynthetic cells, the sucrose provides raw material for cellular respiration and a multitude of anabolic pathways that synthesize proteins, lipids, and other products. A considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose, especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing. Cellulose, the main ingredient of cell walls, is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant--and probably on the surface of the planet.

Most plants manage to make more organic material each day than they need to use as respiratory fuel and precursors for biosynthesis. They stockpile the extra sugar by synthesizing starch, storing some in the chloroplasts themselves and some in storage cells of roots, tubers, seeds, and fruits. In accounting for the consumption of the food molecules produced by photosynthesis, let's not forget that most plants lose leaves, roots, stems, fruits, and sometimes their entire bodies to heterotrophs, including humans.

On a global scale, the collective productivity of the minute chloroplasts is prodigious; it is estimated that photosynthesis makes about 160 billion metric tons of carbohydrate per year (a metric ton is 1,000 kg, about 1.1 tons). That's organic matter equivalent to a stack of about 60 trillion copies of this textbook--17 stacks of books reaching from Earth to the sun! No other chemical process on the planet can match the output of photosynthesis. And no process is more important than photosynthesis to the welfare of life on Earth.
