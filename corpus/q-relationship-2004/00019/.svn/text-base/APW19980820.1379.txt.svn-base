CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
They helped win a war against Soviet troops in Afghanistan .
Their exploits were celebrated across the Muslim world .
Now , in a rain of bombs on two continents , this battle-hardened , devout corps , an `` Islamic International , '' has become the No. 1 target of the world 's No. 1 power .
These Arab veterans of the 1980s Afghan war transformed their old crusade in recent years into a new one against `` illegitimate '' Arab rulers , against an Israel that occupies Muslim land , against an America that supports both .
It was an attack against America , the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in Africa on Aug. 7 , that led to U.S. air strikes Thursday against locations in Afghanistan and Sudan linked to followers of one of the leading `` Arab Afghans , '' Osama bin Laden , an exiled Saudi millionaire .
U.S. President Bill Clinton said bin Laden 's followers were believed to have played a `` key role '' in the embassy bloodshed .
These militants are a small cluster of as many as 25,000 Arabs and other Muslims who left home to fight in Afghanistan .
But their campaign , both in its bloodshed and fervor , may help define the 1990s .
Their paramilitary skills , growing sophistication and ample finance set them apart from an earlier generation .
An eclectic group , the Arab Afghans bombed the World Trade Center in New York in 1993 and the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan two years later .
They are suspected of attacking U.S. -run facilities in Saudi Arabia .
They tried to kill Egypt 's president in Ethiopia .
And they have fought in wars and insurgencies in some of the world 's most troubled spots -- Bosnia , Chechnya , Kashmir and Tajikistan .
Now , in the wake of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania , which killed 257 people , a group of those Arab Afghans has sent another stark message : Their war has just begun .
`` Strikes will continue from everywhere , and Islamic groups will appear one after the other to fight American interests , '' said a statement last week from the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders , a group formed in February .
The group stopped short of claiming responsibility , but its message was sent to Al - Hayat , the Arab world 's leading newspaper , with several statements from a little-known group that did .
Many Arab experts believe they may be one and the same .
From the Arab Afghan ranks have emerged some of the militants Arab governments and others consider the most dangerous today .
They are Egyptians , Saudis , Algerians , among other nationalities , and they cross porous borders with false passports -- Egyptian , Sudanese , Yemeni , even European .
And their international sophistication has grown .
Islamic revolutionaries once passed hand to hand the simple cassettes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 's speeches during the Iranian revolution .
Now , groups of Arab Afghans -- Egypt 's Islamic Group , for instance -- design sleek , colorful web sites that market their fiery messages and offer an e-mail address in Europe , long a refuge for militant leaders fleeing death sentences at home .
`` The majority come from universities , they 're modern and they use modern methods .
Americans imagine these people come from the Middle Ages and that 's not true , '' said Diaa Rashwan , an analyst at Egypt 's Al - Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies .
Osama bin Laden stands as perhaps the most notorious of the new generation of Islamic militant .
Like thousands of other Saudis of his generation , he journeyed to Afghanistan soon after the 1979 Soviet invasion of that poor Muslim nation in central Asia , joining activists who would later form the nucleus of militant Islam , in such groups as Hamas , Egypt 's Islamic Group , Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front and the Moro Liberation Front in the Philippines .
The war was heavily financed by an estimated dlrs 3 billion from America , the biggest covert operation since the Vietnam War .
To Americans , it was a fight against Soviet aggression .
To pious Arabs , it was a sacred fight against an atheist ideology -- a conflict redolent of the international pilgrimage of leftists in the 1930s to fight fascism during the Spanish Civil War .
`` It was very romantic , it was everybody 's cause .
There was so much poetry about the crusade in Afghanistan , '' recalled Jamal Khashoggi , a Saudi journalist who covered the war .
Bin Laden soon emerged as one of that war 's greatest heroes .
Scion of one of Saudi Arabia 's richest families , he gave up a life of plenty to bring in the bulldozers that cut the tunnels and roads along which the guerrillas trekked .
His bravery on the battlefield soon became legendary .
