The fossil record supports that presumption. There is a rich fossil history of prokaryotic life, without solid evidence of eukaryotes, spanning 1.5 billion years, from about 3.5 to 2.0 billion years ago. Relatively early in that prokaryotic world, two main evolutionary branches, the bacteria and the archaea, diverged. Diverse species of these two main prokaryotic groups continue to thrive in various environments today.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Many of the oldest fossils of prokaryotes are found in <span class="Emphasis2">stromatolites,</span> fossilized mats similar to layered microbial mats that certain groups of prokaryotes still form today in salt marshes and warm lagoons (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.4</span>). Researchers have also discovered fossils of prokaryotes in Australian sediments that formed around hydrothermal vents about 3.2 billion years ago. Hydrothermal vents are hot volcanic outlets in the deep-sea floor. Prokaryotes that inhabit such vents today are very different in their metabolism from prokaryotes making up algal mats such as those in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.4b</span>. We’ll explore the metabolically diverse prokaryotes in detail in Chapter 27. For now, the important point is that considerable metabolic diversity among prokaryotes living in various environments had already evolved over 3 billion years ago.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig26-4','../fig/big/fig26-4.jpg','fig26-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig26-4.jpg" alt="fig26-4" name="myfig26-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 26-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Bacterial mats and stromatolites.</span></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
