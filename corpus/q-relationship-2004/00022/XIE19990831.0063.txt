LAGOS , August 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Sierra Leone 's former rebel leader Foday Sankoh said on Monday that he was ready to return home and take up his post as vice-president in a national unity government as agreed in the July 7 peace accord .
He made the remark when international community is urging him to move back to Freetown to facilitate the country 's fragile peace process .
Sankoh said in Togo 's capital Lome that he had said farewell to Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema and would leave for Sierra Leone via Ivory Coast , possibly within hours , according to reports reaching here Monday .
An advance party of aides led by former Sierra Leone Foreign Minister Paulo Bangura was already in Freetown to prepare for his arrival .
`` I will be leaving here within the next few days or even hours .
I met President Eyadema today to say good-bye , '' said the leader of the former rebel organization , the Revolutionary United Front -LRB- RUF -RRB- .
The peace agreement signed in July 7 in Lome canceled a death sentence hanging over Sankoh and appointed him a vice-president .
But Sankoh had expressed concern about his own security in the light of persistent opposition in Sierra Leone to a blanket amnesty for him and his former fighters .
The RUF and its allies have been accused of widespread atrocities in the country*s nine-year-long civil war .
`` We 're not going for a marriage party , so we have to take great care , '' said Sankoh .
According to another report , the suffering S. Leoneans who took refuge in Northern Liberia were compelled to embark on another pilgrim for safety , as a result of the severe fighting between Liberian government forces and its rebels .
About 5,000 S. Leonean refugees have left the town of Kolahun in northern Lofa County for Targbe , about 30 miles to the south , according to a UN High Commissioner for Refugees statement reaching here Monday .
The statement first released in Ivory Coast said that the refugees were worried assistance would not reach them in Kolahun after aid workers were evacuated during fighting near the borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone that broke out Aug. 11 .
The Liberian government says it has regained control over most of the county , and the United Nations plans to send a mission in the next few days to assess whether it is safe for aid agencies to resume operations there .
About 35,000 Sierra Leoneans live in camps in Lofa County , including 10 , 000 who have stayed in Kolahun despite the fighting .
More than a million refugees fled Sierra Leone during its nine-year civil war .
Most of the refugees have not yet returned to their home country , after the signing of the Lome peace agreement .
