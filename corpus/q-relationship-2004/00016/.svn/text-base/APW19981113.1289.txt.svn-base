The looming confrontation in Iraq and the Middle East peace process will top the agenda of Russia 's defense minister and Austria 's foreign minister who arrived for separate talks with Syrian officials Friday .
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would also look at ways of `` boosting military cooperation with Damascus , '' a Russian official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The official said Russia expected to cut arms deals with Syria , but did not elaborate .
Russia has strong influence in Syria , which had close military ties to the former Soviet Union .
Sergeyev will fly to Egypt on Saturday .
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel told reporters on his arrival that Iraq should cooperate with U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction .
The United States and Britain have threatened to attack Iraq if it does not rescind its decisions of August and October that block U.N. arms inspectors and monitors .
Schuessel , who will spend two days here , said Syria had a `` major role '' to play in peace in the Middle East .
Israeli - Syrian peace talks have been stalled since early 1996 .
Syria insists on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
Israel says the plateau is essential to its security .
