Chapter 8: MEMBRANE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

MEMBRANE STRUCTURE

   Membrane models have evolved to fit new data

   Membranes are fluid

   Membranes are mosaics of structure and function

   Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition



TRAFFIC ACROSS MEMBRANES

   A membrane's molecular organization results in selective permeability

   Passive transport is diffusion across a membrane

   Osmosis is the passive transport of water

   Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss

   Specific proteins facilitate the passive transport of water and selected solutes: a closer look

   Active transport is the pumping of solutes against their gradients

   Some ion pumps generate voltage across membranes

   In cotransport, a membrane protein couples the transport of two solutes

   Exocytosis and endocytosis transport large molecules

The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its nonliving surroundings. A remarkable film only about 8 nm thick--it would take over 8,000 to equal the thickness of this page--the plasma membrane controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. One of the earliest episodes in the evolution of life may have been the formation of a membrane that enclosed a solution different from the surrounding solution while still permitting the uptake of nutrients and elimination of waste products. This ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane that makes this selectivity possible.

In this chapter, you will learn how cellular membranes control the passage of substances. We will concentrate on the plasma membrane, the outermost membrane of the cell, represented in the drawing on this page. However, the same general principles of membrane traffic also apply to the many varieties of internal membranes that partition the eukaryotic cell. To understand how membranes work, we begin by examining their architecture.
