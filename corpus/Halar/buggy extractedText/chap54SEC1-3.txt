SECONDARY PRODUCTION IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 The efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually less than 20% 



 

 Herbivores consume a small percentage of vegetation: the green world hypothesis



The amount of chemical energy in consumers' food that is converted to their own new biomass during a given time period is called the secondary production of the ecosystem. Consider the transfer of organic matter from producers to herbivores, the primary consumers. In most ecosystems, herbivores manage to eat only a small fraction of the plant material produced. And they cannot digest all the plant material that they do eat, as anyone who has walked through a dairy farm will attest. Thus, much of primary production is not used by consumers. Let us analyze this process of energy transfer more closely.
