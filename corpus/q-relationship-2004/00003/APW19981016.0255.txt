John Hume , joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , said Friday that the honor represents `` very powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern Ireland . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party , which gets the largest share of votes from Northern Ireland 's Roman Catholic minority , worked tirelessly in pursuit of a cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army and for all-party negotiations .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">He shared the prize with David Trimble , leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , which gets the largest share of Protestant votes .</ENAMEX>
`` I think that today 's announcement from the Nobel committee strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the people what the world want to see on our streets , '' Hume told a news conference in Belfast .
He said the most powerful support for the process came from the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic , who overwhelmingly approved the peace agreement in a referendum in May .
`` The international community in its different ways has also expressed its support , but today 's annoucement from Norway by the Nobel peace committee to David Trimble and myself is a very clear and powerful statement of approval for the peace process and of the international goodwill that exists for us .
`` And as I have said often to many of you recently , the challenge to all of us now , as public representatives in Northern Ireland from all parties , is to harness that international goodwill for the benefit of all our people , particularly our young people , '' Hume said .
Hume addded that `` the work we have all been engaged in is to lay the foundations for lasting peace and stability , and those foundations are at the moment being laid as we put the agreement into practice .
`` And as we lay those foundations and move towards a new century , our hope is -- my hope is and my dream is -- that we 're moving to a completely new society , a new North , and a new Ireland , in which both sections of our people will not only respect one another , but will work together .
`` And once we hav a society in which all our energies are devoted to building together and working together , rather than quarreling , it will transform our society and in my opinion it will become one of the most prominent regions in the whole of Europe . ''
