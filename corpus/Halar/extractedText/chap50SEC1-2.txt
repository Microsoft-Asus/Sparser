FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS

 

 Species dispersal contributes to the distribution of organisms



 

 Behavior and habitat selection contribute to the distribution of organisms



 

 Biotic factors affect the distribution of organisms



 

 Abiotic factors affect the distribution of organisms



 

 Temperature and water are the major climatic factors determining the distribution of organisms



Ecologists have long recognized striking global and regional patterns in the distribution of organisms within the biosphere. Kangaroos occur in Australia but not in North America, while pronghorn antelope occur in the western United States but not in Europe or Africa. More than a century ago, Darwin, Wallace, and other naturalists began to recognize broad patterns of geographic distribution by naming biogeographic realms (FIGURE 50.4). We now associate these realms with patterns of continental drift that followed the breakup of Pangaea (see FIGURE 25.4).

Biogeography is the study of the past and present distribution of individual species. We discussed biogeography in the context of geologic history in Chapters 22 and 25. The field of biogeography provides a good starting point to understanding what limits geographic distributions. To determine what limits the geographic distribution of any particular species, ecologists ask a series of questions (FIGURE 50.5). Let's work our way through this flowchart of inquiry.
