1999 Special to the Houston Chronicle AMMAN , Jordan -- Jordan 's government declared a dying King Hussein no longer able to govern Saturday and handed full powers to his son and politically untested heir , Crown Prince Abdullah .
At a meeting at the prime minister 's office , Cabinet members gave Abdullah , a 37-year -old career military officer who was named successor less than two weeks ago , all powers as head of state .
The king 's physician , Samir Farraj , said in a statement that Hussein , gravely ill from cancer , had suffered kidney and liver failure and that his heart and brain were functioning .
Other officials said the king was hooked up to a life-support machine and heavily sedated .
`` The rest is in God 's hands , '' Jordan 's ambassador to the United States , Murwan Muasher , told reporters .
More than 100 people remained outside the hospital where the 63-year -old Hussein lay dying .
His American -born wife , Queen Noor , and four of his sons wandered through the crowd Saturday , thanking the people for their sympathy .
Prince Abdullah was regent during the brief period when Hussein returned for a bone marrow transplant in the United States .
But the treatment failed , and death is expected once the cancer reaches the heart , a source said .
Saturday 's ceremony made Abdullah the head of state , and he was given supreme authority , including the powers to mobilize the army , dismiss the parliament and appoint the Cabinet .
But little is known about the man or his policies .
A career army officer in charge of elite commandos responsible for maintaining Jordan 's internal security and the royal family 's safety , Abdullah , clean-cut and baby-faced , has yet to reveal much about himself to Jordanians .
As head of the country 's Special Operations Command , he shied away from politics .
Six months ago , when asked by a local Arabic newspaper whether he would want to be king one day , he replied it was an `` unfair question . ''
He added that anything he said `` would be misunderstood . ''
On Saturday , Abdullah was quoted by the London -based al- Hayat newspaper as saying , `` We hope that the transition to power will be in the best and easiest arrangements possible .
I have instructions from His Majesty the King to execute his advice to achieve what is best . ''
Jordanian analysts and Western diplomats said they expect Abdullah to follow in Hussein 's footsteps , particularly on two policy questions crucial to the United States : support for peace with Israel and acquiescence to America 's policy toward Iraq .
During Hussein 's 47-year reign , Jordan had become a reliable U.S. ally and key supporter of Middle East peace efforts .
Persian Gulf states , longtime financial backers of Jordan , now worry about ripples from any upheavals in the strategically located but resource-poor kingdom .
In Washington Saturday , President Clinton asked Congress to speed up aid to Jordan , reflecting the belief that a weak economy may be the main threat facing Abdullah .
Clinton said that the administration is also working with its allies and international lending institutions and its allies to help Jordan deal with its foreign debt , according to The Associated Press .
`` The United States stands by Jordan and is determined to do all that it can to support it and strengthen it , '' he said .
In Amman , Western diplomats were speaking well of Abdullah as a man with good business connections who is concerned about maintaining Jordan 's security .
As head of the army 's special forces , he was involved with weapons procurement for Jordan , often roaming the halls of Capitol Hill to lobby for military aid .
In 1998 , he was instrumental in tripling U.S. aid to Jordan to $ 225 million a year .
`` On the Hill , talking to senators , he was effective and articulate in getting weapons from Congress , '' said one diplomat here , speaking on condition of anonymity .
`` He presented Jordan 's case without a lot of hand-wringing . ''
Such expressions of support sparked suspicion among some in Jordan that the administration was instrumental in Hussein 's abrupt appointment of Abdullah as crown prince last month , just two days after the king dismissed his brother , Prince Hassan , from the post he had held for 34 years .
Some Jordanians believe the United States wanted a weaker leader who would be dependent on a Jordanian military with close ties to the Pentagon and the CIA and unable to effectively challenge American policy in the region .
U.S. officials deny that the administration supported the appointment of one prince over another .
`` Hassan would have had a word to say , like the king did during the Gulf War , '' said Laila Hamarneh , one of Jordan 's leading opposition figures .
She was referring to Hussein 's pro- Iraqi stance during the war .
`` Maybe Hassan would have said , ` We failed in the peace with Israel , ' '' she said .
`` This cannot be done with the leader who is coming now . ''
Despite Prince Hassan 's reputation for aloofness , he had popular support for his seeming willingness to support human rights and democracy , and backing from the rank-and-file Bedouins who make up the backbone of the army .
But most of Jordan 's 4.3 million citizens seem willing to accept Abdullah , whose penchant for daring , love of race cars and easy charm reminds many middle-aged Jordanians of King Hussein in his prime .
Even the prince 's resonant voice reminds them of Hussein .
Many of Jordan 's 3 million Palestinians say they are happy with Abdullah because of his wife : Princess Ranya , the mother of his two children , Prince Hussein , 4 , and Princess Iman , 2 , is a Palestinian from a prominent West Bank family , who was raised in Kuwait .
Despite his poor Arabic , the result of years of schooling in the United States and Britain -- including the British military academy at Sandhurst and Georgetown University in Washington -- Abdullah impressed visiting gulf dignitaries whom he hosted days after being named Hussein 's successor .
He is said to have good ties with his generation of Persian Gulf princes , a potential future asset .
Already , Jordan seems to be mending the rift with Kuwait caused by King Hussein 's support of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War .
Kuwait has allowed a Jordanian representative into the oil-rich gulf state to reopen an embassy there .
King Hussein 's support for Iraq was one of the few miscalculations he made during nearly half a century of rule , Jordanian analysts say .
Long before he was slated to be king , Abdullah seemed aware that his father would leave a towering legacy .
Several months ago , the prince said : `` I would die happy if I realized even a fraction of what my father has realized . ''
