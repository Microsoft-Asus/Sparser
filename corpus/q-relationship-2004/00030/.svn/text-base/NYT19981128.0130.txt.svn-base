ATLANTA --
Gun dealers ' calls for instant background checks are expected to quadruple in Georgia when the permanent Brady Law goes into effect Monday , extending mandatory checks to anyone buying rifles and shotguns .
But gun shop owners do n't expect to lose any business over the expanded checks .
For the last five years , the interim Brady Law has required instant background checks before customers could take home newly purchased handguns .
The new law simply extends that coverage to rifles and shotguns .
Replica weapons -- chiefly muzzle-loading long guns and cap-and-ball revolvers -- are still exempt as are holders of valid Georgia concealed carry licenses .
The permanent law , named after James Brady , who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , also requires pawnshops to run background checks on customers redeeming pawned weapons .
Chuck Severs , who directs the Georgia Bureau of Investigations ' firearms program , said the agency handled 89,109 calls for checks last year .
Of those , 83,673 led to sales of guns , while 7,136 triggered denials .
Although sales records for long guns have never been kept , Severs said they far exceed handgun sales .
`` We 're looking at jumping up to 360,000 transactions next year , '' he said .
Jack Lesher , owner of Chuck 's Firearms in Buckhead , said , `` Georgia is very fortunate in that we go through the state for the checks rather than the federal government . ''
Georgia is one of 10 to 12 states with their own program he said , predicting frequent delays , at least initially , in states relying on the untried FBI system for checks .
`` As a whole , the state program we have is pretty good , '' he said .
That may be due in part to the state 's contract with a Nashville firm to install electronic instant-check terminals in all of Georgia 's high-volume gun dealers .
Checks are conducted entirely through the terminals , without tying up an operator at GBI headquarters in DeKalb County , unless the computer flags a problem .
More than 100 of the terminals have been installed , Severs said .
They cost the dealer nothing , and the state pays the firm about $ 2.50 per transaction .
Licensed dealers at gun shows also are required to make instant background checks .
Such dealers would likely see little impact of a five-day waiting period on sales at gun shows between nonlicensed individuals .
President Clinton said last weekend he wants to pursue legislation requiring the waits .
Matt Eastman , whose Eastman Gun Shows are the largest in Georgia , said not all individuals who rent space at gun shows are licensed firearms dealers ; some are individuals seeking to sell all or part of their collections .
There is no law prohibiting private , unreported gun sales , but Clinton contends many unlicensed dealers at gun shows are violating various laws and perhaps selling stolen weapons .
Eastman , a member of the board of directors of the National Arms Show Dealers , said there would be several ways to enact Clinton 's legislation without seriously disturbing gun shows , ranging from forbidding unlicensed dealers to issuing short-term licenses so that collectors can sell guns with background checks .
Lesher , who deals in the highest quality sporting arms and sells relatively few handguns , said he expects the expanded change to have minimal impact on his business .
`` There may be some initial shock for customers who did n't know about it , '' he said , and computer snags could cause `` some inconvenience for those used to buying their gun and walking right out the door . ''
The law provides that background checks take no more than three business days .
Mark Doss , a salesman at David 's Gun Room in Gwinnett County , agreed the law should n't hurt business .
`` If anything , sales have gone up '' during the five years of background checks on handguns , he said .
Severs said the GBI uses temporary workers to handle calls to the Georgia firearms Program Call Center , which is open from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m .
Monday through Saturday and 8 a.m.. to 6 p.m. Sunday .
The temps also run initial computer checks , which sift through state and federal databases for any criminal history , outstanding warrants , or indications of involuntary hospital commitment .
On Nov. 30 , the computer also will check the new National Instant Criminal Background Check System , which Severs said will bring in data from many federal sources .
If a problem is detected , the operator hands the case to a full-time GBI analyst to investigate .
`` The computer usually responds within 15 or 20 seconds , '' Severs said .
`` If there 's a problem , we 're usually back in touch with the dealer within an hour or two . ''
Severs said the new law will mean bringing the temp staff up to about 30 and doubling the number of analysts from five to 10 .
Buyers will continue to pay the $ 5 fee set by the Legislature for the background check .
It `` comes close '' to covering the costs , Severs said .
Last year , the state collected $ 368,710 in firearms check fees .
Well over half of those denied firearms in Georgia last year -- 4,974 -- had been arrested on felony charges , but had no final disposition of their cases yet .
Convicted felons were denied 1,727 times , fugitives under felony warrants were denied 81 times and individuals convicted of misdemeanor family violence were denied in 353 cases .
Only one person was turned away for mental health reasons .
Doss said he personally has never had a sale nullified by a background check .
But he voiced a common question : `` If 300,000 purchases were turned down all over the nation last year , why were only a few of these people prosecuted ?
It 's a felony to lie on the application . ''
Jack Killorin , special agent in charge of the Atlanta office of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , said the answer is simple : `` The law was designed to prevent something from happening , rather than to put a number of prosecutions on an already heavy federal court document .
However , I would expect to see more prosecutions of this kind in the future .
