EL SAUZAL , Mexico --
Nineteen people , including two diapered infants , were dragged from their beds and systematically killed early Thursday morning in this Pacific coastal village in what authorities suspect was an execution ordered by one of the nation 's biggest drug-smuggling cartels .
The murders were carried out with such apparent order -- each victim was individually shot , and the pajama-clad corpses were stacked next to each other -- that the scene shocked even the most experienced investigators , who have grown accustomed to deadly fights over the area 's growing narcotics trade .
`` It appears they rounded them all up , lined them up and gunned them down , '' said Jose Ramon Espinoza , a judicial police officer from the nearby town of Ensenada , a popular tourist resort just over an hour 's drive south from San Diego .
If the narcotics connection is confirmed , the massacre would be one of Mexico 's worst crime-related killings -- and the latest incident in a growing wave of drug-related violence along the US - Mexico border .
The attorney general of Baja California state , Marco Antonio de la Fuente Virrarreal , said the head of one of the households grew marijuana for the Arellano Felix drug-smuggling gang , one of Mexico 's biggest drug cartels .
He said the man , Fermin Castro , oversaw the Arellano Felix 's marijuana plantations nearby .
Castro was n't killed in the attack , but was in very serious condition with a bullet wound to the head , health officials said .
`` The state and the country are in a state of consternation over the killing of 19 people in El Sauzal , '' Baja California Gov. Hector Teran Teran said Thursday .
`` It appears to be related to narco-trafficking because of the ties of Fermin Castro to the Arellano - Felix organization . ''
The governor said authorities were looking for three automobiles seen leaving the scene of the shooting .
At least one man was seriously wounded in the attack about 60 miles south of the California borner .
Authorities have a witness in protective custody , a 15-year -old girl who hid under a bed during the slaughter , police said .
Police said the attack took place at 4 : 30 a.m. in El Sauzal , a suburb of the resort town of Ensenada .
The victims appeared to be asleep when the gunmen showed up ; most of the bodies were wearing pajamas -- or nothing at all -- and the beds in at least one of the houses were unmade , as if sleeping people had been pulled from them .
Television images showed the victims lined up in a pool of blood in front of a wall .
A television reporter said one woman was clutching a baby in her arms ; both were dead .
The director of the Red Cross in Ensenada , Eugenio Carrillo , said the victims were the residents of three neighboring houses .
He said the dead included nine adults , two teen-agers , six children and a baby .
A 15-year -old girl hid under a bed and escaped notice by the attackers , and police were questioning her about what she saw , a judicial police officer said .
He did not elaborate and the report could not be confirmed independently .
Children 's toys littered the yard outside one house , according to the television footage .
The yard was filled with broken glass and chairs were overturned on the porch , indicating a struggle .
Turkeys cackled in the yard .
Dozens of bullet casings surrounded the bodies , and the Televisa television network said most were from a Kalashnikov assault weapon , although some were from smaller-caliber weapons and shotguns .
A Mexico City criminologist , contacted by Baja authorities shortly after the shooting , said that descriptions of the scene bear signs of a drug-gang hit .
`` This is because of the methodical nature of the incident , '' said the criminologist , who asked not to be identified .
`` The assailants took the time to drag 22 people out of bed , line them up , and then shot them .
And it 's usually drug gangsters who can afford these types of weapons . ''
The criminologist also said there were several farm workers also on the property in the pre-dawn hours , but none were among the victims Ensenada Judicial Police officer Jose Ramon Espinoza said the victims were members of three families : the Flores family and two families that both had the last name Castro .
It was unclear whether the three families were related .
`` It appears they rounded them all up , lined them up and gunned them down , '' Espinoza said .
He said he had no information on suspects or a possible motive .
The drug gang led by the Arellano Felix brothers is based in Tijuana , 60 miles to the north .
The brothers , once known for the violence with which they controlled their territory , had recently been settling into a quieter , more businesslike style after making themselves famous for shootouts in broad daylight .
But Mexican authorities suspect the Arellano Felix brothers were behind the slaying of a rival last week in Ciudad Juarez , just across the border from El Paso , Texas .
Rafael Munoz Talavera , considered a front-runner to succeed deceased Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes , was found shot to death in the back seat of an armored Jeep Cherokee .
