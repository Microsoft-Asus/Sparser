HUNTSVILLE --
Tim had been in prison less than 48 hours when he was first approached by another convict hoping to make the baby-faced teen-ager his girlfriend .
`` I stuck a whole bunch of holes in him , and word got out that this white boy took out a -LRB- black man -RRB- , '' said Tim , using a racial slur .
Tim , now a 30-year -old parolee who asked that his last name be withheld , talked about how he stabbed the other convict with a handmade knife , a `` shank '' in prison lingo .
In a terse , matter-of-fact tone filled with vulgarities , he described the rage that builds behind bars in the nation 's second-largest prison system and explained what drives some felons to join gangs .
`` It 's the white guys that are solid , '' he said .
`` They are the most dangerous , because they are the most violent in the system .
They 'll kill in a heartbeat . ''
His words are chilling for the hatred they portend and their frightening similarity to the types of racial epithets that relatives and longtime acquaintances of Russell Brewer and Bill King say those young men learned in prison .
Brewer and King , along with a third man , Shawn Berry , are charged with murder in the savage dragging death two weeks ago of James Byrd Jr. of Jasper .
Police say Byrd , a 49-year -old black man , was beaten and chained to the bumper of a pickup , then dragged almost three miles along a winding , bumpy back road by the three white suspects .
Byrd 's head and right arm were torn off in the process .
And while many who know Brewer and King say the pair never exhibited any overt racial prejudices before they did hard time in Texas prisons , Jasper and federal authorities have labeled the gruesome killing a racially motivated hate crime .
Sammy Buentello , the chief expert on prison gangs for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , said that none of the men had so-called `` badges , '' prison terminology for gang-related tattoos , when they entered prison .
-LRB- The TDCJ routinely inventories incoming prisoners for tattoos . -RRB-
Berry , who gave police a detailed confession in the Byrd case , implicating Brewer and King as the main culprits , still has no visible tattoos .
But photographs provided by Jasper officials after their arrests show that Brewer and King both have tattoos indicating membership in the Ku Klux Klan and the white supremacist Confederate Knights of America , Buentello said .
He said he does n't know if Brewer and King got the tattoos in prison or after their release , but that both men were monitored while they were at the Beto I Unit in Tennessee Colony for possible membership in the KKK and CKA. Whether Brewer and King learned to hate other races while in prison may never be known .
But what happens behind bars that can turn even previously unremarkable petty criminals into killers so calloused that the viciousness of the crime is unfathomable ?
`` You almost have to live in a cell block to understand , '' said Chuck , a 55-year -old parolee who also asked that his last name be withheld .
Buentello identifies 10 major gangs operating inside Texas prisons , including the Aryan Brotherhood , with about 425 members ; the Mexican Mafia , the largest with an estimated membership of more than 1,400 ; the Texas Syndicate , another Hispanic group whose membership is estimated at 800 ; and the predominantly black Bloods , with about 170 members , and Crips , with about 660 members .
In all , Buentello estimates that 4,900 Texas convicts belong to gangs , less than 4 percent of the 140,000 state prisoners .
And that does n't even count the groups in which King and Brewer were believed involved .
TDCJ does n't classify KKK , CKA and Aryan Circle -- all white supremacy organizations -- as gangs .
Nor does it count many street gangs , whose members may loosely organize behind bars .
But such inmates and groups are monitored .
A group does not become a gang , according to TDCJ , unless it has a written constitution or rules and engages in violent prison activities .
Experts say three crucial federal court rulings in the 1970s and 1980s created the climate for rampant development of gangs and similar groups .
Those are the 1976 Guajardo case which resulted in a ruling that allowed gang members at different prisons to freely write each other ; the 1979 LaMar ruling that desegregated prison cells , exacerbating the racial tensions common in prisons everywhere ; and a 1982 court order in the Ruiz prison reform lawsuit which abolished the building tender system .
Building tenders -- usually older , white inmates -- functioned as guards and spies .
They maintained the social order among felons through intimidation and coercion , and snitching on lower-ranking inmates .
When TDCJ could not hire additional guards fast enough to keep the order that the old building tenders had , gangs sprang up to fill the void , experts say .
Chuck and Tim -- as well as prison administrators , lawyers and criminologists -- say fear , along with a need for family , is a primary reason prisoners join gangs .
There is the fear of being raped , beaten or killed ; of being locked away for years or your entire life ; of casting your eyes the wrong way ; of not learning fast enough the appropriate prison body language -- the stature that says you 're neither submissive nor aggressive .
That fear , combined with crowded living conditions among thousands of criminals who already have shown an inability to abide by society 's rules , gives rise to rage .
Normally minor irritations , such as the volume of a radio or the choice of a TV show , are quickly amplified into major affronts , Chuck said .
`` There 's all this damn noise going on , there 's nothing good happening to you and nothing to look forward to , '' Tim says .
`` So you sit up there and scheme and hate .
And hatred is going to breed hatred . ''
He turned his hatred primarily toward blacks .
`` I really hated them , '' he said .
`` There were just too damn many of them .
You come to hate them . ''
-LRB- MORE -RRB- `` I really hated them , '' he said .
`` There were just too damn many of them .
You come to hate them . '' ...
He insists he was not prejudiced when he entered prison , but learned to hate there .
Despite his continued use of racial slurs , Tim said he has overcome that hatred , thanks in part to intensive peer counseling , in the 20 months he has been out .
That racial hatred is not an uncommon reaction , according to University of Houston criminologist Beth Pelz , a former inmate counselor in the Texas prisons who extensively researched prison gangs for her doctoral dissertation .
`` It 's not like everyone 's sitting in their cells and looking at their feet and saying , ` Gosh , I hate African - Americans or blacks , ' or ` I hate Hispanics or whatever , ' '' she said .
`` Because in reality they get along some of the time quite well . ''
But circumstances in prison are magnified , she said .
When people are looking for someone to blame , whether in prison or not , the tendency is to point the finger at people who are different .
And in prison , where blacks make up the largest group , white inmates , who perceive they have lost social status because they are suddenly a racial minority , the blame is often placed on blacks , she said .
According to TDCJ figures for 1997 , African - American felons made up 45 percent of the inmate population , 28 percent were Anglos and 27 percent were Hispanic .
A 1979 inmate lawsuit supports the notion that some inmates , at least at that time , believed that black convicts had favored status .
The lawsuit , filed by white inmates at the Ramsey Unit , alleged that the federal court order desegregating the prisons gave blacks `` exclusive privilege and favorable consideration in all aspects of institutional rights . ''
The plaintiffs also alleged that offenders , regardless of color or `` personal tastes , characteristics , vocabulary , humor , behavior or language '' were crowded together into small cells or dormitories where racial and personal conflicts are aggravated and often flare into violence and that `` fractious militants '' of ethnic groups frequently fight and that blacks rape white prisoners .
Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said officials could not readily determine what happened to that lawsuit but suspect it `` just went away . ''
Besides , Fitzgerald said , the Ruiz lawsuit addressed those concerns , forbidding inmates to be put in charge of others .
Pelz believes that the problems and perceived injustices in prison are `` due to sheer numbers and the lack of liberty and the deprivations of being in prison .
`` And then when you look around and the majority of the people , or the people you see the most , are different from you , you begin to say , ` It 's your fault . '
'' Irrational , yes , parolee Tim said , but no less real .
And ex-cons have a difficult time ridding themselves of that rage once they are released .
`` When you get out , you 're mad as hell , '' Tim said .
Both he and Chuck say that rage starts boiling over outside prison when parolees ca n't find a job or a place to live .
Pelz , though , believes that gang affiliation has a lot to do with inmates ' backgrounds .
`` The particular groups they tend to be involved with have a lot to do with their attitudes and values before they got to prison , '' she said .
`` There was a time when most of the gang members in Texas prisons were gang members who had joined in prison .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL-OK">But now the street gang members who are being incarcerated actually outnumber what we were historically calling prison gang members . ''
While white supremacist gangs and groups like the Aryan Brotherhood form along ideological lines , others tend to organize for criminal activity purposes , and in prison that means trafficking in drugs , tobacco products , sex and other illegal activities</ENAMEX> .
Despite the current focus on white supremacy groups as a result of the Jasper case , prison gangs today -- unlike the mid-1980s when violence was at a peak -- tend to co-exist in a tense truce , according to some current inmate-members of the mostly black Crips .
The prison world they know is a finely tuned balance of terror , where `` respect '' is the key to multiple gangs co-existing as each nurtures its behind-bars market in cigarettes , drugs and other contraband .
Crips members , who did not want to be identified , note that even white supremacist groups like the Aryan Brotherhood generally refrain from collective attacks on blacks .
`` If they respect us , we respect them , '' one Crip said .
`` It 's when they disrespect us that trouble begins . ''
Prison gangs have a de facto negotiation system to defuse potential conflicts , black gang members said .
If members of rival gangs tangle over a personal issue , in theory the isolated combatants are permitted to resolve their differences without gang interference .
But violence often strikes like lightning .
Diplomacy fails .
`` We saw this white jump on a black , '' said a 23-year -old Houston man serving 10 years for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon .
`` So we acted .
We stabbed him .
I do n't remember exactly how many were involved -- 15 , 20 .
That was in Beto .
`` Sometimes we do n't have time -LRB- to figure things out -RRB- , we just shove off . ''
`` Shoot , all told , I 've seen a dozen riots , whites , blacks , all , '' said a 22-year -old Houston man who has served six years of a 20-year term for murder .
`` There will be 20 or more , hitting , stabbing .
It depends on the gang and what started the problem . ''
Another gang member , a 24-year -old Houston man doing time for aggravated assault , recalled a riot at a San Antonio prison in which at least 40 inmates , some armed with locks and improvised knives , fought a bloody battle over a pair of contraband dice .
The members of the Crips agree they would die for their gang , and some would be willing to kill .
`` Basically it 's a person looking for love , '' the 23-year -old said .
`` My mother died , my father died , my auntie did everything she could for me .
But the Crips offered love .
That 's the gang appeal .
That 's why just about everybody joins .
`` They had open arms . ''
