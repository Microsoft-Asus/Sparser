MONTEVIDEO , March 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Uruguay is planning to increase beef export to Europe as many European countries have banned British beef due to the `` mad cow '' disease , the local press reported today .
Uruguay , Argentina and Brazil are good alternatives to supply beef to the European market , said the president of the Uruguayan Chamber of the Meat Freezing Industry , Daniel Belerati .
