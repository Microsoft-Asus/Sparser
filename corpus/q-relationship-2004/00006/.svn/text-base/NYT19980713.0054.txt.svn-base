WASHINGTON --
The potential nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan is an uneasy and unwelcome test of how to get along in a world where non-proliferation appears to have failed .
When the United States and the Soviet Union confronted one another at the beginning of the nuclear age , they faced a similar test .
With time , they stumbled into a doctrine of `` mutual assured destruction , '' and it became their best guarantee of security .
They never used the ultimate weapon against one another .
In fact , they never fought directly in a hot war of any kind .
So MAD -- the doctrine that two adversaries armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons wo n't go to war because they know they ca n't win one -- became as good a theory as the world had for how to make a nuclear standoff stable .
Can it work just as well between India and Pakistan as it did between the United States and the Soviet Union ?
Most of those in Washington who worry about such questions are , unfortunately , gloomy .
Like Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott , they are working -- and hoping against hope -- to convince the Indians and Pakistanis to stop where they are , halt testing and refrain from turning their nuclear knowledge into weapons .
That hope was not bolstered last week when Congress , out of deference to American farmers , voted to lift sanctions on grain sales to India and Pakistan that had been intended to punish them for their nuclear tests .
Joseph Cirincione , director of the Non - Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment , says that every time the Pentagon has conducted a war game between a nuclear-armed India and Pakistan , the result is a nuclear exchange , something that does not happen between Iran and the United States or Russia and the United States .
`` I 'm sorry to say it , but South Asia is fundamentally different than the United States and the Soviet Union , '' Cirincione said .
`` If both India and Pakistan deployed nuclear weapons , I think it would almost certainly lead to a nuclear exchange in combat . ''
The problem , say senior U.S. officials and analysts , is not India , per se , nor even the smaller and altogether more fragile nation of Pakistan , but their history , proximity and relatively primitive technology .
All of these factors , they say , argue against South Asia achieving the kind of stability that allowed Russians and Americans to survive the Cold War .
These are powerful points .
But each assumption about what is most dangerous in a nuclear race is speculative rather than demonstrated , because the world has not yet reached a point where the theory fails .
Consider , for example , the only standard of success available : the Cold War .
Even during those 40 years , there were some terribly close calls , most notably during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis , when senior U.S. military officials urged President John F. Kennedy to use nuclear weapons against the Soviets .
That raises the question of what role chance played in the decisions that kept the peace once the brink of war was reached , and whether it is just arrogance to say , in hindsight , that it was inevitable that the Americans and Soviets , for reasons of culture and sophistication , would pull back .
Questions of racism or arrogance aside , there is general agreement on the ways in which a nuclear-armed South Asia would find it hard to manage confrontations in the same ways the Cold War antagonists did .
But the same facts can often be looked at in a different way -- revealing not so much that the Indian subcontinent is a safe place , but how little can be known about just what makes a nuclear confrontation dangerous .
Here are the major reasons why some experts on the Cold War are so worried about South Asia : -- Unlike India and Pakistan , Washington and Moscow share no common border , let alone a disputed one , and had a considerable buffer zone between them -- oceans in the first place , and Eastern Europe in the second .
This , the experts believe , gave Washington and Moscow fewer flashpoints and more time for diplomatic maneuver when tensions rose than India and Pakistan have .
-LRB- On the other hand , the very proximity of India and Pakistan could argue for more caution , given the vagaries of fallout , if nothing else . -RRB-
-- Washington and Moscow never fought one another , while the Indians and Pakistanis , in 50 years of hostility , fought in 1948 , 1965 and 1971 .
Even more unsettling , Indian and Pakistani troops today face one another in the fiercely disputed territory of Kashmir , shell each other 's villages and fire on one another 's positions , and soldiers die .
-LRB- On the other hand , both countries have exercised considerable restraint since India carried out its first nuclear test in 1974 , and have not let tensions produce another war . -RRB-
-- Washington and Moscow developed a triad of nuclear weapons -- deliverable by rocket , plane and submarine -- that made real the notion of mutually assured destruction .
But with so few nuclear devices , both Indian and Pakistani military planners have to fear a successful first strike , or destruction of their nuclear capacity by conventional attack .
-LRB- On the other hand , the Cold War had an equally uncertain beginning , and even today , the Russians take seriously the threat of nuclear pre-emption by conventional cruise missiles . -RRB-
-- It took Washington and Moscow nearly 15 years to develop a reliable command and control system for their nuclear weapons and a reliable nuclear doctrine to go along with it .
For the first four years of the nuclear age , the United States was alone in having the bomb , and for the next 10 , there were no intercontinental missiles , only bombers .
So the two countries had the luxury of time to do their planning and confidence-building .
They built a formal means of contacting one another in a crisis , including constantly monitored hot lines .
-LRB- On the other hand , in 1995 , after the Soviet Union collapsed , President Boris Yeltsin pulled out Russia 's equivalent of the nuclear football , containing launch codes , when Russian warning systems interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket as a possible nuclear attack .
The Russians had lost a notification they received from the Norwegians , and experts still wonder , uneasily , why the Russians were in such confusion . -RRB-
Caveats aside , it is South Asia 's lack of technological sophistication that has experts and officials most concerned .
`` What worries military people the most is n't detonation by design , but by unauthorized use , screw-up and miscalculation , a stray electron or misreading the screen , '' said Michael Krepon , president of the Henry L. Stimson Center , which studies security .
`` There have been in the past , for whatever reasons , major explosions at ordnance factories in Pakistan .
What if there was a major explosion at a nuclear storage site , or a major accident at a missile production or storage facility ?
What would be the pressures then ? ''
Rather than discussing a sophisticated early warning system , Krepon points out , India and Pakistan are talking of developing nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach each other 's major cities in seconds .
Asked why Washington and Moscow should n't just provide India and Pakistan with the doctrine and equipment for safe deterrence , Talbott scoffed at the idea of some `` manual '' for a South Asian MAD .
`` If they locked themselves into the mentality of MAD , they will then be tempted into -- like us -- a considerable escalation of the arms race , '' he said .
Further tests would be followed by weaponization and by deployment of missiles , `` and then we 'd be off to the races . ''
But it may also be that in the new world of proliferation , even for the best and brightest , the most successful balance of terror may result from luck as much as doctrine .
Having been lucky thus far , there is no guarantee that the world will continue to be so fortunate .
`` Just assemble all the risk factors and multiply it out , '' Cirincione said of South Asia .
`` This is the most dangerous and unstable military situation in the world . ''
