Only net primary production is available to consumers.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in The Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">

The carbon cycle primarily reflects the reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Nitrogen enters ecosystems by atmospheric deposition and nitrogen fixation by prokaryotes, but most of the nitrogen cycling in natural ecosystems involves local cycles between organisms and soil or water. The phosphorus cycle mainly occurs on a more localized scale than the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity54B:<span class="Emphasis1">
