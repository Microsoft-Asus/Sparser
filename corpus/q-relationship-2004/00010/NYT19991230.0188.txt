NEW DELHI , India --
Negotiations between Indian officials and hijackers holding more than 150 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines jet in Afghanistan resumed Thursday after nearly breaking down in the early hours of the morning , and are now `` delicately poised , '' the foreign minister of India , Jaswant Singh , said Thursday night .
The talks are focused on the hijackers ' remaining demand that India free a jailed Pakistani Muslim cleric and 35 militants opposed to Indian rule of Kashmir .
On Wednesday , the hijackers abandoned their insistence that India pay a $ 200 million ransom and turn over the exhumed body of a slain militant .
Both the Indians and the hijackers are under intense pressure from the ruling Taliban militia in Afghanistan to make a deal and end the week old crisis .
The Indian Airlines Airbus that was seized by the hijackers on a flight from Nepal last Friday has been sitting on the tarmac of an airport in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar since Saturday .
Negotiations broke off at 2 a.m. and Indian officials left discouraged .
`` The negotiations came to a situation of impasse , '' Singh said .
`` There was apprehension about no further resumption of negotiations . ''
Later in the morning , the Taliban , which has made its impatience with the pace of the talks clear , sent in dozens of heavily armed soldiers and trucks loaded with a rocket launcher and an anti-aircraft Stinger missile .
Taliban officials have repeatedly said they would storm the plane if the hijackers began killing passengers on Afghan soil , and the movement of soldiers to the airport raised speculation that such an attack might be imminent -- or that the Taliban was trying to remind the hijackers of what could happen if they resorted to more violence .
The hijackers fatally stabbed one man , a newlywed returning from his honeymoon in Nepal , before the plane reached Afghanistan .
But the Taliban 's foreign minister , Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil , played down the significance of the deployment and said it was just a routine security measure .
`` It does not mean we are going to storm the plane , '' he told reporters in Kandahar .
Singh said neither the Taliban nor the hijackers had set a deadline for an end to the hijacking .
On a day when little information of substance was made public , unconfirmed reports spread quickly that the Indians were close to a deal to release some of the militants in exchange for the freeing of the hostages .
But Indian officials emphatically denied it .
`` There is no such agreement , '' said Raminder Singh Jassal , a spokesman for India 's Ministry of External Affairs .
The hijackers -- their identities still a mystery -- are holed up in the Airbus and talking with Indian negotiators by radio .
The strongest clue to who they are lies in their demand for the release of Maulana Masood Azhar , a Pakistani cleric who was a leader of Harakat ul- Ansar .
The group helped recruit , train and send militants to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir , and is on the U. S. State Department 's list of terrorist organizations .
The status of Kashmir , whose population is predominantly Muslim , has been a festering source of conflict between predominantly Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan ever since they were created from the British empire in 1947 .
In the last decade , indigenous Kashmiri rebels as well as militants sponsored by Pakistan have fought for a separate Kashmiri nation , or for Kashmir 's right to join Pakistan .
Still , the precise motives of the hijackers are murky .
They have not yet spoken directly to the public or to journalists .
Thursday , in a small sign of flexibility , they allowed a young , unidentified male passenger with a serious stomach ailment to leave the plane for treatment at a hospital , but only with the understanding that he would return to the plane .
Singh said the hijackers had refused to allow the passenger to be treated near the airport by Red Cross doctors because the organization had made it clear that it would not be party to returning the passenger to the plane .
Thursday afternoon , the Indian man , looking pale and exhausted , was whisked from the airport in a white van .
Thursday night , there were conflicting reports about whether he had been returned to captivity .
A diabetic hostage , Anil Khurana , who was released on Sunday because of his failing health , returned to Delhi Thursday night .
He had been flown to Islamabad on Monday and taken to the intensive care unit of a hospital there .
