VIENNA , Austria
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- OPEC members unanimously agreed today on a plan to cut crude oil production by 2.104 million barrels a day and to maintain the lower levels of output for a full year beginning April 1 .
The group of 11 oil-producing nations approved the cuts in a unified effort with non- OPEC producers to reduce a global oversupply of oil and strengthen prices that had languished at a 12-year low as recently as December .
`` The compliance , I am sure , will be 100 percent , '' OPEC President Youcef Yousfi of Algeria said before OPEC ministers began a formal meeting .
`` And there is a full determination of all countries to commit to this agreement . ''
`` Smooth sailing '' was how Kuwait 's Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser al- Sabah described the talks that led to the cuts .
`` Everyone is happy , '' he said .
The decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to pump less oil will likely cause gasoline prices to rise further , with some experts seeing increases of as much as 10 cents a gallon .
George Gaspar , an analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co. , a financial services firm based in Milwaukee , said the cuts could continue to buoy gasoline prices into the fall when prices typically decline as colder weather makes driving less attractive .
But oil prices were lower today .
Brent crude oil futures were trading at $ 13.69 a barrel by mid-afternoon on the International Petroleum Exchange in London , down 19 cents from Monday 's close but unchanged since the cuts were announced .
Under the agreement , OPEC nations will reduce oil output by 1.716 million barrels a day , Algerian officials said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Non - OPEC producers like Mexico , Norway , Russia and Oman will reduce production by an additional 388,000 barrels a day</ENAMEX> .
Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's largest producer , will slash output by 585,000 barrels of crude a day .
OPEC 's No. 2 producer , Iran , will curtail daily output by 264,000 barrels , while Venezuela will pump 125,000 fewer barrels of oil a day .
OPEC will evaluate its output levels at the group 's next meeting in September and reserves the right to adjust production levels before the full 12-month period ends , al- Sabah said .
`` It all depends on how the market reacts , '' he said , adding that Kuwait hoped to see prices rise to between $ 17 and $ 18 a barrel .
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said that the production cuts will be sufficient to raise prices `` soon '' but declined to specify a time frame .
Price increases are `` extremely likely '' as a result of the agreement , said Fergus McLeod , an oil analyst at BT Alex .
Brown .
He predicted Brent prices would reach at least $ 16 by year 's end .
`` If they really stick to this for a year , they could end up forcing up the market more than they intend , '' he said .
Ishii Yoshiro , an analyst with Japan National Oil Corp. , doubted that all members of OPEC would comply fully with the lower production levels .
Cheating by members has undermined OPEC 's efforts to stabilize prices in the past .
Libya 's oil minister , Abdalla Salem El - Badri , said his country has already started to notify customers that it will be producing less crude : 96,000 fewer barrels a day under its share of the cuts .
Iraq was n't included in the production cuts because its sales are controlled by the United Nations under an oil-for-food deal .
The agreement to decrease production was reached two weeks ago by Saudi Arabia , Iran , Venezuela and Algeria , together with non-member Mexico .
