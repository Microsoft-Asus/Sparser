Imagine that the experiment is done as follows: Bacteria are first grown for several generations in a medium containing the <span class="Emphasis1">lighter</span> isotope of nitrogen, <SUP>14</SUP>N, then switched into a medium containing <SUP>15</SUP>N. The rest of the experiment is identical. Redraw <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.9</span> to reflect this experiment, predicting what band positions you would expect after one and after two generations, if each of the three models shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.8</span> were true.</p><a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">Virtually reenact the Meselson-Stahl experiment in the Case Study in the Process of Science, available on the website and CD-ROM.</p>

What roles did these two social behaviors play in Watson and Crick’s discovery of the double helix? How might competition between scientists accelerate progress in a scientific field? How might it slow progress?</p>
