									<a name="para86"></a><p class="BlockText">The surface of the planet Mars has many landscape features reminiscent of those formed by flowing water on Earth, including what appear to be meandering channels and outwash areas. Thus far, probes sent to Mars have revealed only trace quantities of water, in the form of atmospheric water vapor, but some scientists suspect a great deal more water may be present beneath the Martian surface. Why has there been so much interest in the presence of water on Mars? Would the presence of water make it more likely that life had evolved there? What other physical factors might also be important?</p>

In agricultural areas, farmers pay close attention to the weather forecast. Right before a predicted overnight freeze, farmers spray water on crops to protect the plants. Use the properties of water to explain how this works. Be sure to mention why hydrogen bonds are responsible for this phenomenon.</p>

									<a name="para92"></a><p class="BlockText">Agriculture, industry, and the growing populations of cities all compete, through political influence, for water. If you were in charge of water resources in an arid region, what would your priorities be for allocating the limited water supply for various uses? How would you try to build consensus among the different special-interest groups?</p>
