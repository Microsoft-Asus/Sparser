MANILA , February 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- After being hit by fresh financial storms in early January , currency and stock markets in Thailand , the Philippines and South Korea made a steady recovery in the past few trading days .
With the encouraging development in the markets , some people predict that the East Asia 's financial crisis has entered its final stage and could be over soon , while some argue that it will persist for some time and the worst has yet to come .
Which is correct ?
Most analysts say it is still too early to judge the trend of the crisis , which started last July .
However , as the crisis has entered its eighth month now , international speculative activities are no longer the main threat to market stabilization .
Structure problems in some East Asian economies , the major cause of the crisis , are unlikely to trigger a new round of financial turmoil .
To a great extent , analysts say , the trend of the seven-month -old crisis would be determined by people 's confidence in economies of the region .
But , to regain investors ' confidence is , among other confidence-building factors , the most important for a brisk market recovery in the months ahead .
Since the Thai financial turmoil burst onto the scene seven months ago , currencies of Thailand , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia and South Korea have lost half of their value against the greenback , and stock values in these countries have also declined by 60 to 70 percent .
The crisis slowed the growth pace of the East Asian economy with some countries ' growth rates falling by 2 to 6 percent in 1997 , and the slowdown will continue this year .
The economic slowdown will affect the return of investment profits , but what could effectively frighten away investors now are bad loans and huge foreign debts in East Asian nations .
In Thailand , the Philippines , Indonesia , Malaysia and South Korea , bad loans are estimated at over 10 percent of the total bank loans .
South Korea 's foreign debts have amounted to 150 billion dollars , Indonesia 130 billion dollars and Thailand 100 billion dollars .
The bad loans will force more bank closures in the near future and reschedules of debt repayment will threaten the survival of some foreign creditors , especially Japanese banks , whose loans account for 60 percent of the total received by East Asia nations .
Together with financial risks are potential political risks and social instability in the region .
Indonesia 's presidential election is scheduled for next month , and the Philippines ' is set for May .
The change of guards in the two countries is creating uncertainty about their political and economic future , which has also made investors nervous .
Moreover , economic reforms under IMF programs are affecting living standards of people , and creating more social problems .
After the IMF offered 117 billion dollars of loans to South Korea , Indonesia and Thailand , the three countries are undertaking economic reforms characterized by high interest rates , social welfare cuts , financial austerity and layoffs .
The belt-tightening programs have already met the opposition of people with protests and riots in these countries .
Coupled with financial risks and potential social instability in the region , investors are expected to take some time to place their confidence in the region , analysts said .
Market stabilization also depends on East Asian nations ' confidence in their own economies .
So far , governments in the region have shown their determination to overcome the crisis by cutting this year 's budgets , including salaries of senior officials .
In South Korea , Indonesia , Thailand and the Philippines , people donated their jewelry and changed dollars into local currencies to help stabilize markets .
All these actions reflected people 's confidence in their own economies and could help make an early market recovery .
Besides , the trend of the crisis is also determined by confidence of local companies in the economy .
The speculative activities by local companies was largely blamed for the market turmoil early last month .
Because of lacking confidence in their own economies , local companies last month hedged dollars to prepare debt repayment for fear of further devaluation of local currencies .
The speculation rocked the markets , triggering a new round of financial turmoil in the region .
At present , East Asian nations are trying one way and another to readjust their economies , and the United States and other West countries , for their own economic interests , are starting to join rescue operations in the region .
The joint operations are strengthening people 's confidence in the East Asian economy .
However , to regain confidence would take some time .
During the course of confidence-building , ups and downs in the financial market are still unavoidable , and the end of the crisis would take a longer time .
