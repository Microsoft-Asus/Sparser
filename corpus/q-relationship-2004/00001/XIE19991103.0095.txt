KUALA LUMPUR , November 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Malaysia Wednesday called on the 53-member countries of the Jeddah -based Islamic Development Bank -LRB- IDB -RRB- to stand together on major international trade issues .
Through a common stance , IDB members could safeguard their trade and economic interest in trade negotiations like the forthcoming third World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- Ministerial Conference , Malaysian Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed told an IDB meeting in Jeddah .
The text of his speech was also released here .
He said the liberalization of international trade rules and services under the WTO constituted a major challenge to growth and development in developing countries .
`` The challenge for us as member countries is to ensure that in moving forward along the path of an open trading system , our respective developmental needs are not neglected , '' he said .
He said close cooperation among IDB members would ensure that the member countries were not marginalized by the current trend towards globalization and liberalization .
He said the recent Asian economic crisis had demonstrated the need to build up IDB members ' resilience and the need to foster close cooperation among themselves .
`` IDB member countries in Asia , in particular , and all member countries in general , have to be prepared to meet the challenges posed by globalization and the failure of the current economic and financial system in ensuring stability , '' Mustapa said .
Lauding the IDB for setting a target to increase intra trade of member countries by one percent a year for the next three years , he said IDB 's efforts to assist the growth of intra trade by 4 billion U.S. dollars this year and multiples of that in the subsequent years deserved a whole hearted commitment from IDB -members .
