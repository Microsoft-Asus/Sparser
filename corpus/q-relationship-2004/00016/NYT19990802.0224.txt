MOSCOW --
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel pressed Russian leaders at the Kremlin on Monday to stanch leaks of advanced-weapons technology to Iran and Iraq , and he received the same reply that the Kremlin has given the United States -- that no such leaks have occurred or will occur , if Russia can help it .
It was the lone issue on which Barak showed any notable dissatisfaction after a one-day visit with Russia 's top leadership , his first since becoming prime minister in May .
For their part , President Boris N. Yeltsin and his underlings greeted Barak as if he were an old friend , a marked change from relations with his hawkish predecessor , Benjamin Netanyahu .
Drawing attention to the fabulous renovation of much of the Kremlin , Yeltsin said , `` We wish similarly to build up our relations with Israel . ''
Barak arrived in Moscow in the middle of the night and met all day Monday with Yeltsin , Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin and Foreign Minister Ivan S. Ivanov .
The talks centered on the Middle East peace effort , where Russia sees a chance to rebuild its diplomatic muscle and Barak spies a chance to influence Israel 's old enemy and Russia 's old ally , President Hafez al- Assad of Syria .
Assad met with Yeltsin less than a month ago , and Russian officials indicated then that they hoped to sell Syria as much as $ 2 billion in advanced jet fighters and other weapons .
Israeli holds a clear military advantage in the region , and a rearmed Syria would hold a stronger position in any peace talks .
Israeli officials said Barak hoped that Yeltsin would provide some measure Monday of Syria 's willingness to move toward reopening peace talks .
Afterward , both sides appeared satisfied but offered few specifics .
`` We both have come to the conclusion that Russia could take a more active part in the normalization of Israeli - Syrian relations , '' Stepashin said .
Yeltsin said the peace negotiations had moved too slowly , and called for Russia and the United States to work as co-sponsors of an intensified search for a permanent accord .
Early in the day , Yeltsin underscored the Kremlin 's renewed ties with Israel by categorically denouncing an outbreak of anti- Semitic acts in Russia like synagogue bombings , recent stabbing of a Jewish leader and the defiling of six Jewish graves last week in Tomsk , in western Siberia .
Extremist leaders in the Communist Party have taken a public lead in promoting anti- Semitism , and Yeltsin has made his disapproval clear but not consistent .
Monday , his deputy chief of staff , Sergei Prikhodko , called anti- Semitic acts ugly and disgusting and quoted Yeltsin as having said , `` There will be no leniency toward those who foment ethnic hatred . ''
In an apparent reference to the synagogue bombings , Yeltsin also promised Barak that `` the culprits will be found and brought to justice , '' Prikhodko said .
Only the question of weapons technology leaks seemed to publicly separate Barak from his hosts Monday .
After the meetings , Barak told reporters that he had told the leaders of Israel 's concern over `` the penetration of missile know-how into Iran and about the absence of control over this in Iraq . ''
He also said leaders had told him that Russia was making every effort to stop the theft and sale of nuclear technologies to the two nations .
The United States has raised the same issues in talks with Russia , and declined to renew contracts with a handful of Russian research institutes earlier this year because of suspicions that they were helping to relay weapons technology to Iran .
Over American objections , Russia has negotiated agreements to help Iran build nuclear reactors that both nations say will be used solely for peaceful purposes .
Monday Stepashin said Russia no more wants a nuclear power on its border than does Israel .
`` If there are any fears or suspicions that know-how which could be used by Iran in the making of nuclear weapons is leaking from Russia , '' he said , `` Moscow is ready to look into these issues . ''
Barak told the Interfax news service that he had been assured that no technology leaks had occurred .
`` I 'm far from thinking that Barak has paid a visit and the problem is solved , '' Barak said .
`` Long -term and careful work is needed here . ''
