 Fermentation enables some cells to produce ATP without the help of oxygen



 

 Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways



 

 Feedback mechanisms control cellular respiration



Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from respiration is contingent upon an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell. Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation ceases. However, fermentation provides a mechanism by which some cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP without the help of oxygen.
