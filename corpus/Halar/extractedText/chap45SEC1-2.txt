CHEMICAL SIGNALS AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION

 

 A variety of local regulators affect neighboring target cells



 

 Most chemical signals bind to plasma-membrane proteins, initiating signal-transduction pathways



 

 Steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and some local regulators enter target cells and bind to intracellular receptors



Chemical signals play a major role in coordinating the functioning of all animals. Hormones convey information via the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body, while other types of chemical messengers reach their target in other ways. As you learned in Chapter 11, local regulators act between cells that are neighbors (see FIGURE 11.3). Once secreted by the cells that make them, these signal molecules are taken up by nearby target cells, broken down by enzymes in the vicinity, or fixed in place by extracellular matrix, all within seconds or even milliseconds. Consequently, local regulators can affect only local targets. Still other chemical signals, called pheromones, carry messages between different individuals of a species, as in mate attraction. You will learn more about pheromones in Chapter 46, which discusses animal reproduction. Before concentrating on hormones and their modes of action, let's take a brief look at some local regulators and their effects on target cells.
