WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Clinton administration now asserts the right to bomb government facilities in nations that provide sanctuary to international terrorists , a significant escalation of U.S. attempts to thwart terrorism .
`` We may not just go in a strike against a terrorist facility ; we may choose to retaliate against the facilities of the host country , if that host country is a knowing , cooperative sanctuary , '' Richard Clarke , President Clinton 's coordinator for counterterrorism , told The Associated Press .
In an interview last week , Clarke described the policy that marks a departure from the tactics employed last August when U.S. cruise missiles struck at alleged terrorist strongholds in Afghanistan and Sudan .
Now the administration contends it could broaden such an attack to include government buildings and assets in nations that knowingly harbor terrorists .
The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned nations that protect terrorist groups .
`` Countries that persistently host terrorists have no right to be safe havens , '' Clinton told the nation Aug. 20 , the day the United States launched scores of cruise missiles at suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan .
But prior to Clarke 's comments , no one in the administration had made the leap from a general denunciation of harboring terrorists to an explicit threat that governments may find their own facilities attacked if they do so .
Had this tactic been employed in the Aug. 20 strikes , the United States might have , for example , targeted Sudan 's government buildings or the Afghan Taliban headquarters .
In fact , the scores of cruise missiles used in that strike were targeted carefully to avoid government facilities and were aimed at the alleged terrorist assets of Osama bin Laden .
The administration alleges that the exiled Saudi millionaire was behind the bombings last summer of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
In Afghanistan , U.S. official said their missiles struck a remote `` terrorist university . ''
In Khartoum , Sudan , cruise missiles struck a privately owned pharmaceutical plant suspected of producing a precursor to the deadly nerve gas VX .
Administration officials emphasized at the time that the missile strikes were not aimed at the governments of Sudan and Afghanistan .
`` We did not go after those governments ' facilities , but those governments need to know that if they continue to be a sanctuary , that they are now at risk , not just the terrorist facilities in those countries , '' Clarke said in the interview .
Officials caution that a president seeking to use force against a terrorist sanctuary government would face a high burden to show that the target government willingly tolerated a terrorist presence .
The added risk of collateral damage or excessive casualties would add political and moral complications .
Nonetheless , a senior administration official familiar with the policy described it as a recent addition to the array of options Washington could turn to in the war against terror .
White House officials say they do n't consider it a change in U.S. policy .
In any case , Clarke 's comments appear to remove the distinction between cases where a nation actively involved in terrorism is struck , such as Iraq or Libya , and nations that merely allow terrorists to operate within their borders .
A senior defense official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the administration distinguishes between nations that `` willingly abetted sanctuary as opposed to those that provided sanctuary because they did n't control that piece of their backyard . ''
Bin Laden is known to have terrorist camps in the Philippines , for example .
The difference , according to State Department spokesman James Foley , is that the Philippines and other friendly governments cooperate with the United States fighting terrorism .
Sudan and Afghanistan have refused to cooperate .
The United States had long complained that those two countries allowed bin Laden to use their territory as safe haven .
Then - U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson traveled to Islamabad in the weeks before the cruise missile strike and failed to persuade the Taliban , the ruling party of the Afghan government , to renounce and expel bin Laden .
Richardson , now Clinton 's energy secretary , said he used diplomacy , not threats of force .
Since then , it is unclear whether the threat of attack on government facilities in a terrorist sanctuary nation has actually been leveled against any nation .
In negotiations last week with the Taliban , U.S. envoy Rick Inderfurth did not raise the specter of strikes on Taliban assets as part of the discussion of bin Laden , who is still believed to be hiding in Afghanistan , said a State Department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
David Tucker , author of a classified report on terrorism while at the Pentagon under Presidents Bush and Clinton , said the administration 's policy on terrorist sanctuaries has roots in international law on an enemy that seeks sanctuary in a neutral country .
This argument was used to justify the U.S. invasion of Cambodia in 1970 .
During the 1980s , the Reagan administration warned East Germany and other Soviet Bloc countries that they would be held responsible for harboring members of the Abu Nidal terrorist organization , Tucker said .
