Darwin’s book drew a cohesive picture of life by connecting the dots of what had once seemed a bewildering array of unrelated facts</span>. The Origin of Species <span class="Emphasis1">focused biologists’ attention on the great diversity of organisms--their origins and relationships, their similarities and differences, their geographic distribution, and their adaptations to surrounding environments. An understanding of evolution continues to inform every field of biology, from exploring life’s molecules to analyzing ecosystems. And applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and conservation biology. Because evolution integrates all of biology, it is the main thematic thread woven throughout this book. This unit of chapters explores the mechanisms by which life evolves</span>.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Darwin made two points in</span> The Origin of Species. <span class="Emphasis1">First, he argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species. Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution, which he termed <span class="Emphasis2">natural selection.</span> The basic idea of natural selection is that a population of organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals. The result of natural selection is <span class="Emphasis2">evolutionary adaptation,</span> a prevalence of inherited characteristics that enhance organisms’ survival and reproduction in specific environments. In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining <span class="Emphasis2">evolution.</span> But we can also use the term</span> evolution <span class="Emphasis1">on a much grander scale to mean all of biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms</span>.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In this chapter, you will learn about the Darwinian view of life and its historical development</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
