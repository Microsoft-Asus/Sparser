WASHINGTON , April 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S. companies are temporarily barred from exporting firearms to Britain , the State Department announced Thursday in an action taken in consultation with the British government .
`` The decision to revoke outstanding munitions licenses for firearms destined to the UK was taken in consultation with the UK after discussions with them , '' State Department spokesman James Rubin told a news briefing .
He said there was no evidence that U.S. firearms exported to Europe actually have found their way into the wrong hands , such as Iran or Iraq .
`` It 's a concern , '' he said .
`` It 's not something we believe has already happened . ''
The temporary ban on firearms exports to Britain resulted from continuous monitoring of the British laws and regulations `` to ensure that retransfer and important controls are sufficiently strong , '' Rubin said .
He said the problem was with new British laws governing handguns , not with any actions by British importers .
`` Wherever possible , actions are taken both by countries to align import and export actions , and this can take the form of license revocations .
This is what happened in the case of the UK , '' he added .
There is , however , no plan to halt firearm sales to other European Union countries , Rubin said .
The ban will last until licenses can be reissued to reflect new British laws governing the re-export of guns to other countries , he said .
