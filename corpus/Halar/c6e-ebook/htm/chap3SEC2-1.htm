Its two hydrogen atoms are joined to the oxygen atom by single covalent bonds. Because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, the electrons of the polar bonds spend more time closer to the oxygen atom. In other words, the bonds that hold together the atoms in a water molecule are polar covalent bonds, with the oxygen region of the molecule having a partial negative charge and the hydrogens having a partial positive charge. The water molecule, shaped something like a wide V, is a <span class="Emphasis2">polar molecule,</span> meaning that opposite ends of the molecule have opposite charges (see <span class="SmallCap">figure 2.13</span>).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The anomalous properties of water arise from attractions between these polar molecules. The attraction is electrical; a slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule. The two molecules are thus held together by a hydrogen bond (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 3.1</span>). Each water molecule can form hydrogen bonds to a maximum of four neighbors, and at any given moment, many of the molecules in a sample of liquid water are linked in this way. The extraordinary qualities of water are emergent properties resulting from the hydrogen bonding that orders molecules into a higher level of structural organization.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig3-1','../fig/big/fig3-1.jpg','fig3-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig3-1.jpg" alt="fig3-1" name="myfig3-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 3-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Hydrogen bonds between water molecules.</span> The charged regions of a polar water molecule are attracted to oppositely charged parts of neighboring molecules.
