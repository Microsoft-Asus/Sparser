GREGOR MENDEL'S DISCOVERIES

 

 Mendel brought an experimental and quantitative approach to genetics



 

 By the law of segregation, the two alleles for a character are packaged into separate gametes



 

 By the law of independent assortment, each pair of alleles segregates into gametes independently



 

 Mendelian inheritance reflects rules of probability



 

 Mendel discovered the particulate behavior of genes:



Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity by breeding garden peas in carefully planned experiments. As we retrace his work in this and the following sections, we will be able to recognize the key elements of the scientific process that were introduced in Chapter 1.
