Prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases are different, and those of eukaryotes depend on transcription factors. Transcription is terminated differently in the two kinds of cells. Also, prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are slightly different. The most important differences, however, arise from the eukaryotic cell’s compartmental organization. Like a oneroom workshop, a prokaryotic cell ensures a streamlined operation. In the absence of a nucleus, it can simultaneously transcribe and translate the same gene (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.22</span>), and the newly made protein can quickly diffuse to its site of function. In contrast, the eukaryotic cell’s nuclear envelope segregates transcription from translation and provides a compartment for extensive RNA processing. This processing stage provides additional steps whose regulation can help coordinate the eukaryotic cell’s elaborate activities (see Chapter 19). Finally, as we have seen, eukaryotic cells have complicated mechanisms for targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular compartment (organelle).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig17-22','../fig/big/fig17-22.jpg','fig17-22');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig17-22.jpg" alt="fig17-22" name="myfig17-22"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 17-22.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Coupled transcription and translation in bacteria.</span> In prokaryotic cells, the translation of mRNA can begin as soon as the leading (5<B>&#39;</B>) end of the mRNA molecule peels away from the DNA template.
