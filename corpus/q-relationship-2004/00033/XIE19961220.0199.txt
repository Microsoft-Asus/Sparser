The LDP 's Research Commission on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs Division went even farther in November , proposing that foreign heads of state and key statesmen be urged to pay homage to the shrine .
This , once again , seriously offends the feelings of Asian peoples , who suffered appalling atrocities at the hands of the Japanese .
Some LDP legislators , led by former cabinet minister Seisuke Okuno , even deny the fact that Japan forced an estimated 200,000 women , mostly Koreans , into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during the war of aggression , despite the Japanese government 's apology over the oft-stated `` comfort women '' issue .
Only in Japan can the absurd arguments and strange theories that embellish the history of aggression run so rife and the shameless reversal of the verdict on the war cry out so loudly .
The political shift to the right was also evident in the acquiescence of the Japanese government to a Japanese state flag being hoisted and a lighthouse being built by a Japanese right-wing group on China 's Diaoyu Island in July .
The Diaoyu islands , an inalienable part of Chinese territory , were forcibly seized by Japan during the war of 1894-1895 launched by Japanese imperialists to annex Korea and China .
For peace and friendship , China repeatedly proposed that the territorial dispute be put on the shelf , with a Sino - Japanese joint exploration of natural resources around the islands .
The proposal was made strategically to benefit bilateral relations between China and Japan as well as peace and stability in the region .
When a friendship treaty was signed in 1978 , Beijing and Tokyo agreed to leave resolution of the issue to future generations .
However , Japan has disregarded the treaty and now controls the uninhabited islands .
All this should remind the world to exercise more vigilance over the actions of a nation which , having achieved economic power , is so determined in its ambition to become a global political power .
