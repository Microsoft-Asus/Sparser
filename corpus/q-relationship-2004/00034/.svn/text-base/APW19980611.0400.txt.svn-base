SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A World Bank sister organization said Thursday it will invest dlrs 247 million in loans and other assistance to help bolster South Korea 's troubled banking sector .
The International Finance Corporation hoped its investment will encourage foreign investors to return to South Korea .
An exodus of foreign investors pushed the country to near bankruptcy late last year before the International Monetary Fund came to its aid .
`` The approval of the projects ... was a vote of confidence in Korea 's long-term viability and a signal of IFC 's commitment as well as its belief in the quick recovery of Korean industry and financial institutions , '' the IFC said in a news release .
The IFC , a World Bank arm that makes loans to developing countries to stimulate growth , said it will provide South Korea 's Hana Bank with dlrs 152 million in loans and other credit lines .
It will invest dlrs 25 million in bonds of Korea Long Term Credit Bank .
The IFC also promised dlrs 30 million in long-term loans for small high-tech companies as well as guaranteeing dlrs 40 million in trade financing that Japan 's Sumitomo Bank provides to Korean exporters .
South Korean banks are desperately seeking foreign investment to help rebuild their depleted capital base .
They have been crippled by a wave of loan defaults since the country 's economic crisis began last year .
As the banks tighten their credit , thousands of companies have gone bankrupt .
The IFC 's commitment followed a dlrs 250 million investment package that Commerzbank AG of Germany announced in May for Korea Exchange Bank .
