PROTOSTOMIA: LOPHOTROCHOZOA

 

 Phylum Platyhelminthes: Flatworms are acoelomates with gastrovascular cavities



 

 Phylum Rotifera: Rotifers are pseudocoelomates with jaws, crowns of cilia, and complete digestive tracts



 

 The lophophorate phyla: Bryozoans, phoronids, and brachiopods are coelomates with ciliated tentacles around their mouths



 

 Phylum Nemertea: Proboscis worms are named for their prey-capturing apparatus



 

 Phylum Mollusca: Mollusks have a muscular foot, a visceral mass, and a mantle



 

 Phylum Annelida: Annelids are segmented worms



The molecular-based phylogeny in FIGURE 33.1 includes the hypothesis that the bilateral animals make up a monophyletic group (clade Bilateria) derived from a common ancestor. And this hypothesis implies that the original bilateral animals--called urbilateria ("ur" is a prefix meaning earliest)--were relatively complex animals with true body cavities (coeloms). In this view of animal phylogeny, simpler bilaterians lacking coeloms (acoelomates) and those having pseudocoeloms (not completely lined by mesoderm) evolved secondarily from coelomates. The molecular data place the origin of bilaterians in the Precambrian period, before the Cambrian explosion. And trace fossils apparently left in Precambrian sediments by burrowing animals support the hypothesis of an early origin for the coelom, which provides a hydraulic skeleton that can function in burrowing (see Chapter 32).

The data from molecular systematics reinforce the traditional division of the bilateral animals, based mainly on differences in embryonic development, into the protostomes and deuterostomes (compare FIGURES 32.4 and 32.8; also, see FIGURE 32.7). However, the molecular-based phylogeny splits the protostomes into two clades: Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa (these names are derived in Chapter 32). In this section, we take a closer look at the lophotrochozoan phyla.
