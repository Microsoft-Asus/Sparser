TRAFFIC ACROSS MEMBRANES

 

 A membrane's molecular organization results in selective permeability



 

 Passive transport is diffusion across a membrane



 

 Osmosis is the passive transport of water



 

 Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss



 

 Specific proteins facilitate the passive transport of water and selected solutes: a closer look



 

 Active transport is the pumping of solutes against their gradients



 

 Some ion pumps generate voltage across membranes



 

 In cotransport, a membrane protein couples the transport of two solutes



 

 Exocytosis and endocytosis transport large molecules



The biological membrane is an exquisite example of a supramolecular structure--many molecules ordered into a higher level of organization--with emergent properties beyond those of the individual molecules. The remainder of this chapter focuses on one of the most important of those properties: the ability to regulate transport across cellular boundaries, a function essential to the cell's existence as an open system. We will see once again that form fits function: The fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cell's molecular traffic.
