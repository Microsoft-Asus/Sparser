At that time, three botanists, working independently on plant-breeding experiments, reproduced Mendel’s results. By searching the scientific literature, the German Karl Correns, the Austrian Erich von Tschermak, and the Dutchman Hugo de Vries all found that Mendel had explained the same results 35 years before. During the intervening years, biology had grown more experimental and quantitative and thus more receptive to Mendelism. Nevertheless, many biologists remained incredulous about Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment until evidence had mounted that these principles of heredity had a physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes. Mendel’s hereditary factors--genes--are located on chromosomes. For example, the yellow dots (a fluorescent dye) in the light micrograph on this page mark the locus of a specific gene on a homologous pair of human chromosomes (which have already replicated, hence the two dots per chromosome). This chapter integrates and extends what you have learned in the past two chapters by describing the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions.</span></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
