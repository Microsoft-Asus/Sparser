SANTAFE DE BOGOTA , November 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Former Colombian Defense Minister Fernando Botero has accused General Comptroller David Turbay of involvement in drug trafficking , a charge he pledges to back with evidence .
Botero made the accusation in a letter sent to the RCN radio network from the military stockade where he has been a prisoner since last August .
According to the former minister , `` there is proof of Turbay 's connection with the Cali and Medellin drug cartels .
The comptroller , who is in charge of overseeing the state expenditures , `` has had relations with drug trafficking for many years .
There are lots of evidence showing Turbay is in a permanent relationship with Pablo Escobar Gaviria , the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers , Guillermo Ortiz Gaitan , and Pastor Perafan , '' added Botero .
Botero , who served as President Ernesto Samper 's electoral campaign general director in 1994 , was sentenced to six months in prison for the injection of millions of dollars from the Cali cartel to the campaign .
Botero alleged that in the second round of the presidential campaign of 1994 , Turbay requested financial resources from the Cali cartel `` to oil the liberal machinery on the Atlantic coast . ''
At that stage of the presidential election , according to Botero , Turbay distributed money among liberal legislators and organized the flights of the `` narcoplane '' to deliver the money in several regions .
The former minister , who said early this year that President Samper `` did know of the drug traffickers ' contributions to his campaign , '' announced in his message to RCN that he had asked the country 's General Prosecutor to expand the investigation so as to verify his charges against the comptroller .
`` Turbay has used his power as the Comptroller against me since the investigations of 1994 and 1995 arrived at the conclusion that he was one of the fundamental political pieces for the Cali cartel , '' he said .
The comptroller , in turn , is investigating alleged irregularities in a contract of the Defense Ministry signed by Botero in 1995 with a Swiss - U.S. business .
