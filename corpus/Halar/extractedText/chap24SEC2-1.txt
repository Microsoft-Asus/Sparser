 The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation

A classical species definition known as the biological species concept was first enunciated by evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1942. Mayr's definition addresses the question, What factors divide biological diversity into separate forms that we identify as species?

The biological species concept defines a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed with one another in nature to produce viable, fertile offspring, but who cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other species (FIGURE 24.2). In other words, a biological species is the largest set of populations in which genetic exchange is possible and that is genetically isolated from other such populations. Members of a biological species are united by being reproductively compatible, at least potentially. A businesswoman in Manhattan has little probability of producing offspring with a dairyman in Mongolia, but if the two should get together, they could have viable babies that develop into fertile adults. All humans belong to the same biological species. In contrast, humans and chimpanzees remain distinct biological species even where they share territory, because the two species do not interbreed. Thus, the biological species concept hinges on reproductive isolation, with each species isolated by factors (barriers) that prevent interbreeding, thereby blocking genetic mixing with other species.
