Chapter 4: CARBON AND THE MOLECULAR DIVERSITY OF LIFE

THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON

   Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds

   Carbon atoms are the most versatile building blocks of molecules

   Variation in carbon skeletons contributes to the diversity of organic molecules



FUNCTIONAL GROUPS

   Functional groups contribute to the molecular diversity of life

   The chemical elements of life: a review

Although water is the universal medium for life on Earth, most of the chemicals that make up living organisms are based on the element carbon. Of all chemical elements, carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form molecules that are large, complex, and diverse, and this molecular diversity has made possible the diversity of organisms that have evolved on Earth. The protein shown in the computer graphic image above is an example of a large, complex molecule based on carbon (the green atoms). Proteins are a major topic of Chapter 5. In this chapter, we focus on smaller molecules, using them to illustrate a few concepts of molecular architecture that highlight carbon's importance to life and the theme that emergent properties arise from the organization of the matter of living organisms.
