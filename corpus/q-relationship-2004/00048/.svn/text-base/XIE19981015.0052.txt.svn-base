UNITED NATIONS , October 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- China Wednesday reiterated its position of supporting international efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Changhe told the First Committee of the 53rd Session of the U.N. General Assembly that China has improved its export control system through new regulations .
As a state party to the Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention , China has faithfully honored its obligations and imposed strict control on the export of sensitive items and their production technologies and equipment , he said .
In the past two years , the Chinese government has promulgated the Regulations on the Supervision and Control of Chemicals , the Regulations on Nuclear Export Control , and the Regulations on the Control of the Export of Duel - Use Nuclear Materials and Related Technology .
Moreover , Li said , China applies strict control to the transfer of conventional military equipment and related technologies , and has issued the Regulations on the Control of the Export of Military Products in October 1997 .
`` Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of sciences and technologies are just two sides of one coin , '' Li said , noting that they should complement rather than exclude each other .
The international non-proliferation efforts should be fair and rational , and should not apply double standards whereby non-proliferation is used as a pretext to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other nations , Li added .
