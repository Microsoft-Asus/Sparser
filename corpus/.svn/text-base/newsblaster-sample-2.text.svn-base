  The money includes more than $330m from the US and more than $250m
  from the European Union, a US official said.

  Outbreaks in Indonesia and Turkey have continued, with Indonesia
  confirming its 14th human death on Tuesday, and Turkey diagnosing at
  least 21 cases of bird flu in humans.

   International donors have pledged US$1.9 billion to support a
   global fund to combat bird flu, EU Health Commissioner Markos
   Kyprianou said on Wednesday after a conference in Beijing,
   exceeding an initial target.

   The World Bank had hoped the donors' conference would raise at
   least $1.2 billion.

   The United States responded with a pledge of about $334 million,
   saying in a statement the money would be mainly in the form of
   grants and technical assistance. The total EU pledge is nearly $250
   million.

China reports another death from the virus

BEIJING -- After a year of unprecedented appeals for money to cope
with the Asian tsunami and the South Asia earthquake, the world dug
deeper yesterday, pledging $1.9 billion to fight bird flu and prepare
for a potential pandemic.

The United States alone came up with $334 million that will largely be
used to help poor countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and
Indonesia, where the H5N1 bird flu virus is endemic. The European
Union pledged another $261 million, responding with a renewed sense of
urgency after the disease killed four children in Turkey.

As the two-day donors conference wrapped up in Beijing, participants
were again reminded of the risk as China reported its sixth human
death.

''Nobody's wishing for more tragedies or more crises, but if the world
has a better ability to respond to those, I think that's a good
thing," said Jim Adams, head of the World Bank's bird flu task force,
who said the $1.9 billion in pledges over three years was a proactive
step for the international aid community, which often responds to
major disasters after they happen.

The World Bank had estimated $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion would be
needed to prepare for a potential global pandemic and to fight bird
flu, which has killed or forced the slaughter of an estimated 140
million domestic birds since it began ravaging poultry stocks across
Asia in late 2003. The virus has killed at least 79 people in east
Asia and Turkey.
