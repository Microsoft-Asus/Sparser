WASHINGTON , February 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United States said on Wednesday that it was concerned about the deterioration of Russia 's early warning defense against missile attack .
`` We are concerned about the potential deterioration of Russia 's ballistic missile attack warning capabilities without referencing any specific systems , '' State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters .
The Washington Post , in a report from Moscow on Wednesday , said Russia cannot replenish the array of satellites it needs to monitor U.S. missile silos and nuclear-armed submarines .
`` For several hours every day Russian military commanders cannot see any of the U.S. missile fields nor can they monitor the most dangerous threat to their own forces -- U.S. Trident submarines submerged in the world 's oceans , '' the Post quoted Russian and Western analysts as saying .
Rubin said the United States was following up an offer President Bill Clinton made at the Moscow summit last September to exchange information on missile launches and early warning systems .
`` We 're pushing hard , and we need to have more discussion and response from the Russians , '' he said .
The United States and the Soviet Union mounted early warning systems during the Cold War to guard against a surprise missile attack .
This gave the two sides a chance to prepare for an attack and to retaliate if missiles were on their way .
A defective system would make it harder to sort out information and to decide what to do .
Rubin said Russia 's political and military leaders have said they believe there is a greatly reduced likelihood of a nuclear , or a large-scale conventional , attack .
`` Therefore , we believe the idea that there are increased risks of a serious miscalculation overstates the current Russian launch posture , which is based on their assessment of whether there is a real chance of a nuclear or conventional attack , '' he said .
