The <span class="Emphasis2">fossil record</span> is the ordered array in which fossils appear within layers, or strata, of sedimentary rocks that mark the passing of geologic time. Paleontologists collect and interpret fossils (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 25.1</span>). We begin this section by studying how fossils form and how paleontologists determine their age. We then turn to the contributions and limitations of the fossil record in the study of phylogeny.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig25-1','../fig/big/fig25-1.jpg','fig25-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig25-1.jpg" alt="fig25-1" name="myfig25-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 25-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A gallery of fossils.

This is a skull of <span class="Emphasis1">Homo erectus</span>, a human ancestor that lived about 1.5 million years ago. <span class="Emphasis2">(c)</span> Fossils may become even harder if minerals replace their organic matter. These petrified (stone) trees in Arizona are about 190 million years old. <span class="Emphasis2">(d)</span> Some sedimentary fossils, such as this 40-million-year-old leaf, retain organic material, including DNA, which scientists can analyze. <span class="Emphasis2">(e)</span> Buried organisms that decay may leave molds that may be filled by minerals dissolved in water. The casts that form when the minerals harden are replicas of the organisms, as in the case of these casts of animals called brachiopods. <span class="Emphasis2">(f)</span> Trace fossils are footprints, burrows, and other remnants of an ancient organism’s behavior.
