ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS IN CHROMOSOMAL INHERITANCE

 

 Alterations of chromosome number or structurecause some genetic disorders



 

 The phenotypic effects of some mammaliangenes depend on whether they were inheritedfrom the mother or the father (imprinting)



 

 Extranuclear genes exhibit a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance



Sex-linked traits are not the only notable deviation from the inheritance patterns observed by Mendel, and the gene mutations that create new alleles are not the only kind of changes to the genome that can affect phenotype. The last section of this chapter discusses major chromosomal aberrations and their consequences, as well as two types of normal inheritance that are exceptions to the standard chromosome theory.
