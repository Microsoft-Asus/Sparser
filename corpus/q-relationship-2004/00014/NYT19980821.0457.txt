Before leaving Washington to return to his vacation in Martha 's Vineyard Friday night , Clinton met with his national security advisers for about an hour and telephoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan .
Pakistan has vigorously protested the attack , which sent dozens of cruise missiles soaring over its territory .
In the morning , Pakistan 's government issued an angry statement saying an errant American cruise missile had in fact exploded in Pakistani territory , killing five or six people .
But the government later retracted the claim , though not before the report dominated Clinton 's conversation with Sharif .
Clinton 's senior aides also sought to rally support for the attacks on Capitol Hill , where some critics on Thursday had questioned the attacks , or at least the timing of them , given the furor over Clinton 's admission of an intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky on Monday night .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Cohen , joined by Gen. Henry Shelton , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , met in a classified briefing with a dozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers Friday afternoon .
The lawmakers emerged sounding persuaded by the administration 's justification for the strikes , citing what some called `` irrefutable evidence '' that satellite photographs , intercepts of telephone conversations and statements by a suspect in the embassy bombings who is now being held in Kenya .
`` What they shared with us made it crystal clear that terrorism had escalated against us , '' Sen. Gordon Smith , R - Ore. , said in a telephone interview .
In the wake of the strikes , which involved roughly 75 cruise missiles fired from undisclosed positions in the Arabian and Red seas , the administration warned that retaliatory attacks against American targets were a grave possibility .
The FBI reiterated a security alert first issued in the hours after Thursday 's strikes , and public buildings , airports and military bases in the United States and abroad beefed up security .
Despite the risks , the administration defended the strikes , citing the nation 's right , as defined in the U.N. charter , to defend itself .
Berger said the administration considered the camp outside the remote Afghan town of Khowst `` to be a military target . ''
At the State Department , the under secretary of state for political affairs , Thomas Pickering , declared that the United States could not sit idly just because it was not clear missile strikes alone would not stop future terrorist attacks .
`` We could not simply batten down the hatches and wait for the next attack to hit us , '' he said .
`` We had to act decisively .
We do not expect that these strikes will in themselves end the threat , but they are important because they clearly show that we are in this for the long haul . ''
Abroad , the strikes sparked official denunciations and street protests in the Sudan and Afghanistan .
There were also angry demonstrations in Pakistan .
In the Afghan capital , Kabul , protests converged on the U.S. Embassy .
In Kabul , two U.N. workers were shot in separate attacks that appeared to be related to anger over the American strikes .
The day swirled with confusion over the success of the strikes and uncertainty over what might happen next .
The Pentagon 's reticence to confirm publicly even the most fundamental details of the strikes -- including the names of the Navy ships involved or even the exact number of missiles fired -- compounded the uncertainty , as did Cohen 's vague assertions that additional American attacks could be in the offing .
The poor weather in Afghanistan also disappointed officials in Washington who hoped to learn how effective the strikes had been .
Thursday 's strike in the Sudan seemed to have accomplished its mission .
Stark television images broadcast from the Sudan confirmed the strike heavily damaged a pharmaceutical factory that administration officials described as a manufacturer of building blocks for chemical weapons .
Berger declared it `` functionally destroyed . ''
Sudan 's state-run television said 10 people had been injured , but none , evidently , were killed .
Sudan 's president , Omar Hassan al- Bashir , was quoted by Reuters saying the factory , Al Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. , was a benign commercial venture that produced half of the nation 's medicines .
The success of the strike in Afghanistan was less clear .
In Kabul , the Taliban faction that rules the country announced that 21 people had died in the attack on the base , while 30 others were injured , but the spokesman for bin Laden put the dead at 28 in his remarks to the editor of Al - Quds Al - Arabi .
Here in Washington , officials said they had no way of knowing who died , and the Pentagon received conflicting , unverifiable intelligence reports .
Some said bin Laden was dead ; others said he was alive , according to one senior administration official .
The United States timed the attack to what they believed to be a gathering of terrorists at the camp , but today Cohen said it was not clear that the assembly had in fact taken place .
Regardless , Cohen said the attack did not target individuals as much as the barracks , ammunition stockpiles and other facilities spread over six separate sites within the complex .
`` Striking the facilities in themselves is a worthy goal , '' he said .
With only one chance a day for spy satellites to photograph the area , a full assessment will take at least another day , perhaps longer , depending on the weather .
There were early indications that while some missiles hit their targets , others missed entirely .
`` Some of the facilities have been destroyed completely , '' a senior Pentagon official said .
`` Some have been damaged heavily .
Some have been damaged lightly .
And some have been missed entirely . ''
