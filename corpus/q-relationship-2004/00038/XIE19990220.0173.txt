SEOUL , February 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Japanese yen 's sudden depreciation against the U.S. dollar is likely to deal a blow to South Korea 's economy .
At the Tokyo market , the yen traded at 119.75 against the dollar Friday , down 1.06 from the previous day .
Due to the yen 's fall , the South Korean won fell to 1,200 against the dollar Friday afternoon , down 18.10 won from Thursday .
Meanwhile , the share prices at the Seoul stock market also tumbled Friday , the second day in a row , with the key index losing 2.65 percent to 522.18 points after a 2.78 percent decline Thursday .
South Korea , whose economy has just began recovery and is highly dependent on exports , is concerned with the yen 's rapid depreciation could deal a severe blow to its export performance , which has been in trouble since the financial crisis in late 1997 .
South Korea 's export products , such as automobiles , electronics , and steel , all of which are the nation 's key export items competing with Japanese goods in world markets , will lose their price competitiveness , said analysts .
The yen 's decline was prompted by the Japanese government 's policy shift toward invigorating the business cycle in bid to overcome nine-year old business slowdown by lowering market interest rates and liquidity expansion .
Economists said Japan is seeking to increase money supply to recover its business activity even at the risk of inflation .
So Japan is likely to float national bonds and bond prices will drop and long-term interest rates will rise .
South Korea market experts forecasted that the yen will devalue further to the level of 120-130 yen against the greenback in the coming days .
Some of them even do n't rule out the possibility that the U.S. dollar will rally to above the 150-yen level by the end of this year .
If and when the yen continues to fall , the South Korean won should be devalued , they said .
However , observers said the rapid depreciation of the yen will have little effect on South Korean exports as the won is being flexibly floated .
