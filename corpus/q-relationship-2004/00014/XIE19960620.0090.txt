Under increasing pressure , Netanyahu is obliged to get down with it .
But according to the Israeli press , the rightwing prime minister has very few options and has to weigh the pros and cons before taking any decisions .
First , maintaining the status quo and keeping the military presence in Hebron .
This is advocated by the Jewish settlers in the city and adjacent Kiryat Arba settlement and supporters of continued Israeli control over the West bank .
They argue that this is the only way to prevent Hamas militants from using Hebron to prepare terrorist attacks .
Critics of this option note that in the long run , this policy would endanger Israeli security , lead to resumption of the intifada -LRB- uprising -RRB- , cause immediate international isolation , and create a sharp political conflict with the United States .
A confrontation would endanger U.S. financial and military aid to Israel and Washington 's vital political support .
Secondly , complete withdrawal .
This would involve possibly immediate security risk , but gain full support from the international community and the United States .
It would demonstrate Netanyahu 's commitment to the peace process , and create a reservoir of political credit .
However , if this leads to renewed public bus suicide bombings , the new government will lose its credibility among its supporters , and internal disputes will surface inside the Likud itself .
Thirdly , partial withdrawal .
This choice might provide a middle road , indicating Netanyahu 's intention to honor the peace agreement , but linking Israel 's further action to Palestinian Authority 's compliance .
But this would still be widely criticized as an abrogation of the terms of the peace agreement and would cause significant political costs .
And it would only be viable if it receives at least somewhat support from Washington .
As redeployment is dragging on , tensions between the 450 Jewish settlers and the vast majority of the Palestinian residents in the city are mounting and a sparkle may spread to a big fire .
