AMMAN , Jordan --
For more than 20 years , she was his wife and confidante , an American -born beauty who became a Jordanian queen .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">And even with the death of King Hussein , no one here is expecting Queen Noor to go away .</ENAMEX>
At age 47 , she is now the honored widow of a monarch whose family includes his 11 children , by four wives .
Queen Noor was at the king 's side throughout his illness and is said to have been a buoying force as family members gathered around his hospital bed .
And as the king lay dying , she won hearts here by venturing into the rain on Saturday evening , her head covered modestly in white chiffon , to circulate outside the hospital gates -- the widow-to-be comforting the bereaved .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">It was a graceful gesture from the queen , who has been a target of sniping in the past but whose strength and warmth have recently won her increasing affection , and who is now seen as likely to endure as an important voice behind the Jordanian throne .</ENAMEX>
`` She was a Jordanian standing there with her fellow Jordanians , sharing the moment and her emotion and feeling , '' said Sima Bahouf , who has worked closely with the queen since 1986 .
Queen Noor was not seen in public Sunday .
She had rarely left her husband 's side during his treatment for cancer over the last six months , and her confidantes said she was grieving in private .
But she is expected to be on center stage at her husband 's funeral on Monday , and she won praise from Washington Sunday as President Clinton , a good friend , called her `` a daughter of America and a queen of Jordan who had `` made two nations very proud . ''
The new king , Abdullah , is not Queen Noor 's son .
He was born to Princess Muna , the king 's second wife .
Queen Noor 's own eldest son , Hamzeh , 18 , was passed over last month when the king appointed a new heir .
But in an arrangement that many here believe was a parting gift from the late king , an enduring role for her family line was cemented Sunday when King Abdullah named Hamzeh as his crown prince .
Hussein 's widow was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby to a Christian Arab - American family and raised in Washington , D.C. She took the name Noor al- Hussein -- the light of Hussein -- when she converted to Islam and married the king on June 15 , 1978 .
The queen quickly became a warm stepmother to two of the king 's children , Prince Ali and Princess Haya , the children of the king and his previous wife , Queen Alia , who died in a helicopter crash in 1977 .
Queen Noor and the king have had four children of their own , two boys and two girls , beginning with Prince Hamzeh , who was born in 1980 .
But the queen has not always been regarded with favor at home .
A 1974 graduate of Princeton University , she has been an outspoken advocate for women 's rights , economic development and environmental protection .
She has been seen by some Jordanians as too ambitious , too forceful and too foreign to be queen in what is a very conservative society .
She shocked some Jordanians several years ago when she posed for a magazine photograph with her husband on one of the king 's Harley - Davidson motorcycles .
More recently , during the internal palace jockeying over who would succeed the king , she was subjected to particularly harsh barbs from people close to the king 's brother , Hassan , who was then the crown prince .
But her associates say she has tried to turn a deaf ear to criticism from people who saw her and her son as Hassan 's rivals , recognizing as one of them put it , that , `` If you want to attack a man in the Middle East , then the easiest target is his wife . ''
And in his last public statement , the angry Jan. 25 letter that dismissed Hassan as crown prince , the king offered an eloquent testimonial to a wife he said had been the target of baseless criticism , calling her `` a Jordanian who belongs to this country with every fiber of her being . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">There is no constitutional place for the king 's widow within Jordan 's monarchical system , but there is precedent for a powerful role .
After Hussein himself was crowned in 1952 , at age 16 , his mother , Queen Zein , was a major force for well over a decade , advising her son as he matured as a statesman .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Queen Noor almost certainly has more political experience than Abdullah , a career soldier .
She has served as a roving ambassador for Jordan , and was a frequent visitor to the White House at the king 's side .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Well -connected Jordanians say they believe the new king may well turn to Queen Noor as a unifying source of institutional memory and as someone who can help to solidify a royal family that otherwise might find itself divided</ENAMEX> .
