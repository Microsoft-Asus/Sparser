Most autotrophs are photosynthetic organisms that use light energy to synthesize sugars and other organic compounds, which they then use as fuel for cellular respiration and as building material for growth. Plants, algae, and photosynthetic prokaryotes are the biosphere’s main autotrophs, although chemoautotrophic prokaryotes are the primary producers in certain ecosystems, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 50.23</span>).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Organisms in trophic levels above the primary producers are <span class="Emphasis2">heterotrophs,</span> which directly or indirectly depend on the photosynthetic output of primary producers.

Energy flow starts from the sun as solar radiation, moves as chemical energy transfers in the food web, and finishes as heat radiated into space. Materials flow through the trophic levels eventually to detritus and then cycle back to the primary producers.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
