HONG KONG --
No one ever said the US - China relationship was an easy one .
But the roller coaster ride of the last 20 years , jolted recently by allegations of espionage and recriminations over trade and human rights , has done what few observers imagined possible : taken a nosedive .
After years of improvements in relations despite fits and starts , the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade threatens to drag relations to one of the lowest points since diplomatic ties were established 20 years ago .
Other scandals and allegations , of illegal campaign donations and leaked satellite technology , have dogged leaders on both sides and have become political footballs , but were largely ignored by the public .
Even the Chinese missile crisis of 1996 , when the United States sent aircraft carriers to protect Taiwan , was viewed in Beijing mainly as a standoff with Taiwan , not as a conflict with Washington .
But the NATO bombing that killed three and wounded a score of Chinese citizens has sparked universal outrage in China , with massive protests and near-riots against US targets continuing for the third day Monday .
For that reason alone , it will be far harder for Washington to repair the damage done to an already rocky relationship -- or for Beijing to accept an apology and still save face with its people .
`` I do n't think there 's any doubt that this is the worst point since the normalization of Sino - US relations 20 years ago , '' said Richard Baum , a political scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles .
`` Things will get worse before they get better .
If they get better . ''
Ultimately , the US -led NATO bombing may become for China what the 1989 massacre of student protesters around Tiananmen Square became for the United States : a transgression serious enough to freeze relations , and a stick to beat the other side with for years .
Monday , from the White House , President Clinton offered a fresh apology for the bombing .
`` I apologize .
I regret this .
I think it is very important to draw a clear distinction between a tragic mistake and ethnic cleansing '' carried out by Serbians in Kosovo .
But the unrivaled reputation of the US military for technological wizardry has made it hard not only for ordinary Chinese , but also for America watchers and policymakers in China , to believe the bombing was accidental .
Without a significant effort by Washington and NATO to make amends , an apparently accidental strike could undermine years of hard work in what may be the most important bilateral relationship of the coming decades .
`` Maybe some backward country could make such a mistake , but the US is so efficient , '' said Xiong Zhiyong , dean of international studies at Foreign Affairs College in Beijing .
Xiong suggested the United States should offer reparations for the victims and to rebuild the Chinese Embassy .
China , of course , would hardly be averse to playing the bombing for diplomatic advantage .
Frequent reminders of NATO 's tragic error could force the United States to ease its criticism of China on human rights and arms proliferation , and grant concessions for China 's admission to the World Trade Organization .
The incident has already diverted attention away from China 's alleged theft of technology and supposed scheme to influence US elections .
`` The Chinese love to have some weapon to beat you over the head with in later negotiations , and this is a pretty good one , '' said Don Klein , an Asian specialist and retired professor of politics at Tufts University .
Some Western analysts predicted the two nations will ride out the storm , mainly because commercial ties have become too lucrative to ignore .
China is one of the largest trading partners of the United States , raking in a $ 57 billion trade surplus with the United States last year , meaning a downturn in relations would not help either side .
The vitriolic protests have prompted some American businesses to send employees out of China .
Monday , Boeing , Chubb and Rockwell International kept Beijing offices closed , sources said .
But Chinese scholars said Westerners should not be surprised by the violent protests ; it is hard to overstate the visceral reaction among Chinese to an attack by Western powers who have a history of subjugating or isolating China .
A history of imperialism and colonization has left Chinese sensitive to perceived bullying or attacks on China 's sovereignty .
Some analysts fear relations could degenerate to a renewed Cold War .
`` This is for China what Tiananmen was for the US , '' a relationship deal-breaker , Xiong said .
For starters , China announced Monday it would suspend talks with the United States on human rights , arms control and international security .
It was a largely symbolic gesture , because talks on those issues are mostly stalled anyway .
The bombing could be a convenient excuse for China to halt discussion on uncomfortable issues , but Western analysts said the action was the minimum Beijing had to take , considering the Chinese public 's demands for retaliation .
Tuesday the bodies of the victims of the NATO strike are expected to return to Beijing , and a memorial service will probably stoke public emotions .
The protests take place less than a month before the 10th anniversary of the June 4 , 1989 , massacre of student protesters in Tiananmen Square .
May 4 was the 80th anniversary of the student movement for democracy and science and against imperialism .
Analysts said the timing could not be worse for the government , which risks backlash if it blocks demonstrations , but fears unabated protests could turn against the leadership .
All of this is bad news for leaders on both sides who had been working to improve relations .
Anti - US sentiment may serve to marginalize reformers in the Chinese leadership such as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji , who is seen as soft on Washington for granting concessions during WTO negotiations .
Zhu 's visit to the United States last month was a much-hailed , albeit minor advance in relations , but any gains from that went up in smoke with the bombing .
Some protest banners have demanded that Zhu resign .
The crisis is the latest in the years that Washington and Beijing have attempted to repair decades of antagonism .
In the 1950s , the United States and China fought in Korea .
In the 1960 's China assisted North Vietnam in its fight against the United States .
The 1970s brought ping-pong diplomacy and a Sino - US united front against the Soviet Union .
With the 1980s came the opening of China 's economy .
That all changed with the massacre of 1989 , which halted military ties and loans , and catapulted human rights to the top of the agenda , said David Zweig , a China specialist at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology .
In the post- Cold War era , the United States no longer needs China as a counterbalance to a Soviet threat , but neither does China need the United States as anti- Soviet wedge , he added .
`` It 's a much more complicated relationship now , '' Zweig said .
`` The Chinese feel the US wants to rule the world .
It 's a period of growing power and nationalism in China -- and increasing fear in the US of rising Chinse power . ''
