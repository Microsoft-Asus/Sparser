North Korea on Monday denied infiltrating a spy boat into South Korean waters last week , calling the allegation an anti- North smear campaign .
A suspected North Korean spy boat crossed the fog-shrouded buffer zone into South Korean waters off the west coast early Friday but sped away after South Korean marines fired at it .
South Korean military investigators concluded that the boat had attempted to land or ferry back espionage agents in South Korea .
They believed the boat 's mission was thwarted before it reached shore .
`` The loudmouthed intrusion incident is a product of premeditated anti- North smear campaign of the bellicose elements of the puppet military who seek tense inter- Korean relations and showdown , '' the North 's official Korean Central News Agency said .
`` They are launching a smear campaign aimed to make an impression as if the North were a source of the tense situation , synchronized with U.S. President Bill Clinton 's trip to South Korea , '' it said .
During a four-day visit to South Korea which ended early Monday , Clinton strongly warned North Korea against developing nuclear and chemical weapons .
The North 's infiltration attempt led South Korean marines and navy to go on alert in Kanghwa , a strategic island near the western sea border with North Korea .
Seoul 's Defense Ministry earlier denounced the infiltration as a `` reckless provocative move . ''
An armistice , not a peace treaty , ended the 1950-53 Korean War and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war .
Their border is the world 's most heavily guarded , with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides .
