WASHINGTON --
Faced with growing criticism of its satellite exports to China , the Clinton administration is rethinking whether to allow one of the biggest sales to date , a $ 650 million deal President Clinton quietly approved two years ago .
Government officials said the Pentagon and State Department are raising new questions about whether a Chinese -controlled company with close ties to China 's military should be allowed to buy the satellites , which contain some of this country 's most sophisticated communications equipment .
The satellites are the cornerstone of a commercial mobile phone network planned for China and 21 other Asian nations .
American officials said their design includes a powerful antenna that could eavesdrop on mobile phone calls in China or other countries in the region .
It could also be used by the Chinese military to transmit messages through hand-held phones to remote parts of China .
Antennas of these dimensions are a mainstay of America 's and Russia 's eavesdropping satellites and have not previously been exported to China , though a sale to the United Arab Emirates is pending .
They also can be used to extend the range of mobile phones used commercially .
Clinton leaves next week for China , and the administration had hoped to use the trip to showcase a variety of business deals and agreements , including enhanced cooperation on civilian satellite and rocket projects .
Administration officials said concerns about the pending satellite sale had been deepened by American intelligence reports about Chinese Army Gen. Shen Rongjun , who oversees his country 's military satellite programs .
The reports quote the general as saying he was planning to emphasize the role of satellites in gathering information .
In an unusual arrangement , Hughes Space and Communications hired Shen 's son , a dual citizen of Canada and China , to work on the project as a manager .
The company said it was aware of his family ties , but it is not clear whether the Clinton administration knew .
Father and son were both directly involved in the project , and American officials said the intelligence reports say the general was pressing his son to move it forward .
The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese military was sending many of its coded messages through American -made commercial satellites sold to Asian companies .
China 's military satellite network collapsed in 1996 , when its first generation of satellites wore out and the replacements failed to work as planned .
President Clinton approved the Hughes project on June 23 , 1996 , after his advisers assured him the communications satellite technology was readily available from European suppliers and would not contribute to Chinese military capabilities .
China already has a burgeoning cellular telephone system , which relies on ground -based transmitters .
There are almost 1.5 million cellular phones in Beijing and Shanghai , but the system is less developed in the country 's more remote areas , industry officials say .
Donald O'Neal , a spokesman for Hughes , said the satellites are `` inherently dual use , '' meaning that they have both civilian and military potential .
`` The satellite is not designed for military application , '' he said .
`` But I do n't know how you can prevent it . ''
The federal government could still stop the deal .
O'Neal says Hughes is waiting for the Commerce Department to review its application to sell the satellite to the Asian consortium , APMT or Asia - Pacific Mobile Telecommunications .
Liu Tsun Kie , a spokesman for the consortium said in a telephone interview from Singapore , that the telephone satellite network would be marketed to civilians by regional telecommunications operators .
It would be up to regulators in China , he said , to decide if the Chinese military could use the satellites .
Liu predicted the Clinton administration would eventually approve the deal .
`` In view of the improving Sino - American relationship , as well as the close rapport established between the U.S. satellite industry and major industry leaders in China and the Asia Pacific , '' he said , `` we are confident that APMT will obtain all the necessary approval and export license to insure no delay in satellite launch . ''
Making a satellite sale to China involves two crucial steps that occur simultaneously .
Aerospace manufacturers must persuade the president to sign a waiver of the sanctions imposed on Beijing after the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989 .
Each project requires a separate waiver .
At the same time , companies apply to government agencies for permission to export specific technologies used in the satellites .
Satellite exports to the Chinese military are banned , but sales to Chinese companies are generally allowed , unless they would significantly advance military development in areas like intelligence gathering and nuclear weapons .
Clinton granted the waiver for the Hughes project two years ago and the company obtained the necessary export licenses .
Since then , however , Hughes has changed the design to enhance the satellite 's capabilities , requiring it to seek a new license .
That decision is now before a panel headed by the Commerce Department and including officials from the Pentagon , State Department , the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Department of Energy .
Each department casts a single vote , with the decision made by majority rule .
A dissenting agency can appeal to the president , but that has never happened in the two-year history of the interagency process .
A Commerce Department spokesman declined to discuss the case , saying it involved confidential business information .
Privately , Commerce Department officials are arguing the deal should go forward because the design approved in 1996 is substantially the same as the current configuration proposed by Hughes , administration and Congressional officials said .
But some Pentagon and State Department officials believe the license should face more scrutiny in light of the new information about Shen and the capabilities of the satellite .
Administration officials also said that the increased scrutiny by Congress of the Chinese military and American satellites has prompted officials pay closer attention to exports to China .
Several congressional committees are investigating whether the policies on technology exports hurt the national security .
The House recently voted to ban future satellite exports to China , and the Senate is scheduled to take up similar legislation soon .
The issue turns on highly technical questions .
An administration official who disagrees with the Commerce Department 's analysis said the Hughes design is substantially different from what was approved two years ago .
`` The antenna sent up the flags , '' the official said .
`` It is more powerful than what we have licensed before . ''
The antenna allows the satellite to receive incoming signals .
But a sophisticated antenna , like the one currently under review , can become a listening device that is very effective , government reports show .
Before 1996 , the Pentagon could easily have stopped the license , because satellites were treated as military items and subject to State Department authority .
That year President Clinton shifted jurisdiction to the Commerce Department , easing the controls and lessening the influence of the Pentagon , a senior government auditor told Congress earlier this month .
APMT was organized in the early 1990s .
Most of its stock was held by five Chinese state-owned entities : China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control , a unit of Costind , the scientific and research arm of the Chinese military ; the China Aerospace Corporation , part of the defense-industrial complex ; China Resource Holdings , a trading company that owns a bank in Hong Kong with the Riady family of Indonesia , and subsidiaries of the electronics and telecommunications ministries .
A small stake was held by a Singaporean company .
In February 1996 , the consortium authorized Hughes to proceed with the design and construction of a massive mobile satellite telecommunication network that would span 22 countries in Asia and the Pacific , from Pakistan to Indonesia .
China 's own space program was then under severe strain .
A Chinese rocket exploded shortly after liftoff in February .
Two months later , engineers from Hughes and Loral Space and Communications were brought in by insurers and China Aerospace to help figure out what went wrong .
The conversations that ensued between the companies and Chinese technicians are now the subject of a criminal investigation , which is seeking to determine whether American export laws were violated .
Both companies deny wrongdoing .
While China was trying to repair its rocket program , its satellites began to fail .
The first generation of domestically produced satellites , launched by the Chinese military in the early 1990s , were wearing out , and the first replacement , built in cooperation with the German company Daimler - Benz , had failed to achieve proper orbit after its 1994 launch .
In early 1996 , all this led China 's most senior military official , Gen. Liu Huaqing , to discuss his concern that year with Shen , who until a recent reorganization was a senior Costind official and oversees China 's satellite and rocket launching programs , American officials said .
General Shen and General Liu have publicly promoted satellite technology as crucial to the future development of China 's military capabilities .
General Shen has privately assured his colleagues about his ability to fix China 's satellite problems and improve the military 's surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities , American officials said .
At about the same time , there were urgent concerns within Hughes and its APMT partners over the how long it was taking President Clinton to make a decision about the deal , O'Neal and American officials said .
Commercial satellite exports to China have been banned since the killings in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , but the president can waive the prohibition , which Presidents George Bush and Clinton have done 20 times .
