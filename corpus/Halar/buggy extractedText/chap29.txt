Chapter 29: PLANT DIVERSITY I: HOW PLANTS COLONIZED LAND

AN OVERVIEW OF LAND PLANT EVOLUTION

   Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants

   Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants

   Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae



THE ORIGIN OF LAND PLANTS

   Land plants evolved from charophycean algae over 500 million years ago

   Alternation of generations in plants may have originated by delayed meiosis

   Adaptations to shallow water preadapted plants for living on land

   Plant taxonomists are reevaluating the boundaries of the plant kingdom

   The plant kingdom is monophyletic



BRYOPHYTES

   The three phyla of bryophytes are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts

   The gametophyte is the dominant generation in the life cycles of bryophytes

   Bryophyte sporophytes disperse enormous numbers of spores

   Bryophytes provide many ecological and economic benefits



THE ORIGIN OF VASCULAR PLANTS

   Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors

   A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago



PTERIDOPHYTES: SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS

   Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves

   A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants

   Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants

   Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period

When you view a lush landscape, such as the Tasmanian forest scene in the photo above, it is difficult to picture the land without any macroscopic organisms. But that is how we must imagine Earth for almost the first 90%  of the time life has existed. Life was cradled in the seas and ponds, and there it evolved in confinement for 3 billion years. Paleobiologists have discovered fossils of cyanobacteria that coated moist soil about 1.2 billion years ago, but the long evolutionary pilgrimage of more complex organisms onto land did not begin until about 500 million years ago. The terrestrial communities founded by plants transformed the biosphere. Consider, for example, that humans would not exist had it not been for the chain of evolutionary events that began when certain descendants of green algae first colonized land.

The evolutionary history of the plant kingdom is a story of adaptation to changing terrestrial conditions. That is the historical context in which this chapter and the next survey the current diversity of plants and trace their origins.
