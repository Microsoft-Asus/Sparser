A plant resumes the growth and development that were temporarily suspended when the seed and its embryo became dormant. Conditions required to break dormancy vary between plant species. Some seeds germinate as soon as they are in a suitable environment. Other seeds remain dormant and will not germinate, even if sown in a favorable place, until a specific environmental cue causes them to break dormancy.</p><p class="Header3">Seed Dormancy</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Seed dormancy increases the chances that germination will occur at a time and place most advantageous to the seedling. Breaking dormancy generally requires certain environmental conditions. Seeds of many desert plants, for instance, germinate only after a substantial rainfall. If they were to germinate after mild drizzle, the soil might soon be too dry to support the seedlings. Where natural fires are common, many seeds require intense heat to break dormancy; seedlings are therefore most abundant after fire has cleared away competing vegetation. Where winters are harsh, seeds may require extended exposure to cold; seeds sown during summer or fall do not germinate until the following spring. This assures a long growth season before the next winter. Very small seeds, such as those of some lettuce varieties, require light for germination and will break dormancy only if they are buried shallow enough for the seedlings to poke through the soil surface. Some seeds have coats that must be weakened by chemical attack as they pass through an animal’s digestive tract, and thus are likely to be carried some distance before germinating.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The length of time a dormant seed remains viable and capable of germinating varies from a few days to decades or even longer, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Most seeds are durable enough to last a year or two until conditions are favorable for germinating. Thus, the soil has a pool of nongerminated seeds that may have accumulated for several years. This is one reason vegetation reappears so rapidly after a fire, drought, flood, or some other environmental disruption.</p><p class="Header3">From Seed to Seedling</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Germination of seeds depends on the physical process of imbibition, the uptake of water due to the low water potential of the dry seed. Imbibing water causes the seed to expand and rupture its coat and also triggers metabolic changes in the embryo that enable it to resume growth (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.13</span>). Following hydration, enzymes begin digesting the storage materials of the endosperm or cotyledons, and the nutrients are transferred to the growing regions of the embryo (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.13</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig38-13','../fig/big/fig38-13.jpg','fig38-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig38-13.jpg" alt="fig38-13" name="myfig38-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 38-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Mobilization of nutrients during the germination of a barley seed.</span> After the seed imbibes water, the embryo releases hormones called gibberellins (GA) as signals to the aleurone, the thin outer layer of the endosperm. The aleurone responds by synthesizing and secreting digestive enzymes that hydrolyze stored foods in the endosperm, producing small, soluble molecules. One example is <span class="symbol">a</span>-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch. (A similar enzyme in our saliva helps us digest bread and other foods made from the starchy endosperm of ungerminated seeds.) Sugars and other nutrients absorbed from the endosperm by the scutellum are consumed during growth of the embryo into a seedling.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The first organ to emerge from the germinating seed is the radicle, the embryonic root. Next, the shoot tip must break through the soil surface. In garden beans and many other dicots, a hook forms in the hypocotyl, and growth pushes the hook aboveground (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.14a</span>). Stimulated by light, the hypocotyl straightens, raising the cotyledons and epicotyl. Thus, the delicate shoot apex and bulky cotyledons are pulled aboveground, rather than being pushed tip-first through the abrasive soil. The epicotyl now spreads its first foliage leaves (true leaves, so called to distinguish them from cotyledons, or "seed leaves"). The foliage leaves expand, become green, and begin making food by photosynthesis. The cotyledons shrivel and fall away from the seedling, their food reserves having been consumed by the germinating embryo.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig38-14','../fig/big/fig38-14.jpg','fig38-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig38-14.jpg" alt="fig38-14" name="myfig38-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 38-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Seed germination.</span> The radicle, the root of the embryo, emerges from the seed first.

We can trick a bean seedling into behaving as though it is still buried by germinating the seed in darkness. The seedling extends an exaggerated hypocotyl with a hook at its tip, and the foliage leaves fail to green. After it exhausts its food reserves, the spindly seedling stops growing and dies.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Peas, although in the same family as beans, have a different style of germinating (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.14b</span>). A hook forms in the epicotyl rather than the hypocotyl, and the shoot tip is lifted gently out of the soil by elongation of the epicotyl and straightening of the hook. Pea cotyledons, unlike those of beans, remain behind underground.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">Corn and other grasses, which are monocots, use yet a different method for breaking ground when they germinate (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.14c</span>). The coleoptile, the sheath enclosing and protecting the embryonic shoot, pushes upward through the soil and into the air. The shoot tip then grows straight up through the tunnel provided by the tubular coleoptile.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Seed germination is a precarious stage in a plant’s life. The tough seed gives rise to a fragile seedling that will be exposed to predators, parasites, wind, and other hazards. In the wild, only a small fraction of seedlings endure long enough to become parents themselves. Production of enormous numbers of seeds compensates for the odds against individual survival and gives natural selection ample genetic variations to screen. However, this is a very expensive means of reproduction in terms of the resources consumed in flowering and fruiting. Asexual reproduction, generally simpler and less hazardous for offspring than sexual reproduction, is an alternative means of plant propagation.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
