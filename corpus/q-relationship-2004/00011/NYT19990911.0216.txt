WASHINGTON --
The Soviet KGB fabricated evidence linking the CIA to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and passed the material to unwitting conspiracy theorists in the United States , according to a new book based on KGB files brought to the West by a defector .
According to the files turned over by a former KGB archivist to British intelligence and detailed in a new book , Moscow 's Cold War spy service took several steps designed to link the CIA to the Kennedy assassination .
These steps included forging a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to a CIA officer , E. Howard Hunt , asking for information `` before any steps are taken by me or anyone else , '' according to the new book , `` The Sword and the Shield , '' written by Christopher Andrew and the former KGB officer , Vasily Mitrokhin .
The book is to be published by Basic Books later this month .
The Oswald letter was supposed to have been written about two weeks before Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22 , 1963 , but was actually created by the KGB in the mid-1970s , after Hunt 's name had surfaced in the Watergate investigation , according to KGB files copied by Mitrokhin while he served as a KGB archivist .
The letter was then passed anonymously to three conspiracy buffs and entered circulation in the United States when it was picked up by one writer of self-published assassination books , the authors report .
The letter led to a brief flurry of interest when a Dallas newspaper reported that a handwriting expert declared it to be genuine , but a congressional panel that re-investigated the Kennedy assassination in the late 1970s later concluded that the letter was probably a forgery .
The KGB 's clumsy propaganda campaign never had much of an impact on the debate over the Kennedy assassination in the United States .
But the archives spirited out of Russia by Mitrokhin appear to support the longstanding assertions by CIA officials that the KGB conducted disinformation campaigns designed to raise dark suspicions about the U.S. government and prominent American leaders around the world .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- The book also suggests that those efforts were amateurish and often silly .
In August 1967 , for instance , the KGB authorized a plan to discredit the Rev. Martin Luther King by planting articles in the African press portraying him as an `` Uncle Tom '' who was secretly being paid off by the government so that he would make sure the civil rights movement would not threaten President Lyndon B. Johnson .
The KGB was apparently frustrated that a moderate like King had emerged as the most influential voice in the civil rights movement , but Moscow 's comical propaganda revealed the KGB 's lack of understanding of American politics and society .
The KGB 's propaganda campaign had even less impact than the FBI 's separate , but equally fumbling , efforts to smear King .
`` News that the KGB was attempting to plant false stories in the African press portraying Dr. King as an ` Uncle Tom , ' at the very time when Dr. King was harshly attacking Johnson 's conduct of the Vietnam War indicates that American police agencies were not the only Keystone Kops active in the 1960s , '' said David J. Garrow , a historian at Emory University and the author of `` The FBI and Martin Luther King Jr. '' -LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist in charge of managing many of the spy
When he arrived in Britain in 1992 and sought out British intelligence , he brought with him a huge cache of notes that he said he had taken based on those files , and turned them over .
The Mitrokhin files , which the British considered reliable enough to share with the CIA and FBI , have offered Western intelligence and law enforcement officials a treasure trove of historical information about KGB operations around the world .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- And while the archives quoted in the book contain only limited information about Soviet espionage cases , the archives have already helped identify some spies .
In the United States , for instance , the book reveals that the Mitrokhin files helped lead the FBI to Robert Lipka , a former code-clerk at the National Security Agency , who worked as a Soviet mole in the 1960s .
Lipka was arrested in 1996 and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage .
Information about other open spy cases contained in the archives were withheld from the book , including on the case of a former State Department official , Felix S. Bloch , who was suspended in 1989 and resigned in 1990 but was never charged or arrested .
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- Mitrokhin first attempted to defect to the United States , but was received a lukewarm reception from a CIA officer when he approached the agency in a Baltic country soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Officials say that the CIA 's Soviet/East European Division had decided that the KGB was no longer a threat and had instituted a controversial new policy that led CIA officers in the field to turn away many defectors .
Paul Redmond , who was then the CIA 's deputy chief of counterintelligence , said in an interview that he sought to take over the Mitrokhin case after other officials had failed to show interest , but by then Mitrokhin had turned to the British .
Redmond now argues that the CIA 's diffident handling of Mitrokhin 's efforts underscored a larger problem , which was that the CIA decided `` naively '' after the collapse of the Soviet Union to scale back its espionage operations against Moscow .
ABC News reported on this controversy Thursday .
The CIA apparently did miss a good bet with Mitrokhin , since his archives seem to reveal a wide array of intriguing insights into KGB operations against the West .
Among other things , according to the book , the files show that the KGB planted secret caches of weapons in Europe and probably in North America as well , apparently for use in the event of war .
They also appear to show that the KGB sought to blackmail German Chancellor Willy Brandt in the 1960s by alleging that he had spied for Moscow during World War II .
While Brandt was living in exile in Sweden during the war , he had provided information about Germany to the Soviets as well as the British and Americans , but never committed espionage , the files show .
But in 1962 , the KGB attempted to blackmail Brandt by threatening to use evidence of his dealings with the KGB 's Stockholm residency against him , according to the Mitrokhin archives .
The attempt failed .
The book says that Mitrokhin 's files also pointed to the existence of a previously unknown British agent who was recruited on ideological grounds by the Soviets during the 1930s , but who survived the collapse of the famous Kim Philby spy ring .
Melita Norwood , code-named Hola in the Mitrokhin files , remained in place after the others in the Cambridge spy ring were identified or forced to defect to Moscow .
The book says that , after being recruited to the Soviet cause in the 1930s , Norwood began to spy for Moscow after she started working in the British Non - Ferrous Metals Association in 1945 , providing information on Britain 's project to build its first atomic bomb .
She spied for the Soviets for decades , and in 1958 Moscow secretly awarded her the Order of the Red Banner .
According to the book , she also tried to recruit other British officials to spy for Moscow , and succeeded in convincing at least one unidentified British civil servant to provide the Soviets with technical information and intelligence on British arms sales in the 1960s and 1970s .
She retired without being arrested and , now 87 , lives in a suburb of London , where she spoke to reporters after news of her past was revealed Saturday in The Times of London .
She said she had no regrets .
`` I did not want money , '' the newspaper quoted her as saying .
`` It was not that side I was interested in .
I wanted Russia to be on an equal footing with the West . ''
`` Older people , the ones who lived through it , might understand , '' she added .
`` I 'm not so sure about the young generation .
I hope they accept it . ''
