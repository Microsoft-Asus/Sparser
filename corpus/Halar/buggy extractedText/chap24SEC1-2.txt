MODES OF SPECIATION

 

 Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species



 

 Sympatric speciation: A new species can originate in the geographic midst of the parent species



 

 The punctuated equilibrium model has stimulated research on thetempo of speciation



There are two general modes of speciation based on how gene flow among populations is initially interrupted (FIGURE 24.6). In a speciation mode termed allopatric speciation (from the Greek allos, other, and from the Latin patria, homeland), speciation takes place in populations with geographically separate ranges. Gene flow is initially interrupted or reduced between two populations because they are separated in space. In the second speciation mode, called sympatric speciation (from the Greek sym, together), speciation takes place in geographically overlapping populations. Here biological factors, such as chromosomal changes and nonrandom mating, reduce gene flow.
