 Phylum Ctenophora: Comb jellies possess rows of ciliary plates and adhesive colloblasts

Comb jellies, or ctenophores, superficially resemble cnidarian medusas. However, the relationship between ctenophores and cnidarians is uncertain. There are only about 100 species of comb jellies, all of which are marine. Ctenophores range in diameter from about 1 to 10 cm. Most are spherical or ovoid, but there are elongate and ribbonlike forms up to 1 m long. Ctenophora means "comb-bearer," and these animals are named for their eight rows of comblike plates composed of fused cilia. They are the largest animals to use cilia for locomotion. An aboral sensory organ functions in orientation, and nerves running from the sensory organ to the combs of cilia coordinate movement. Most comb jellies have a pair of long, retractable tentacles (FIGURE 33.8). The tentacles bear adhesive structures called colloblasts (also called lasso cells). When prey (mostly small plankton) contact a tentacle, colloblasts burst open. A sticky thread released by each colloblast captures the food, which is then wiped off the tentacle into the mouth.

Fig 33-8. A ctenophore, or comb jelly. This planktonic marine animal is named for its eight combs of cilia, used for locomotion. The retractable tentacles capture food. Ctenophores and cnidarians are radiate, diploblastic animals, but these two phyla may have originated independently from different parazoan ancestors.
