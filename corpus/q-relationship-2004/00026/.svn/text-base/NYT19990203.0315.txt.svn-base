MONTREAL --
The skies over a long swath of Canada , together with parts of Europe , Russia and central Asia , are scheduled to flare with a new kind of light as Russian cosmonauts attempt to test a bizarre space technology meant to brighten life in northern cities .
If all goes as planned , cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station will unfurl an 82-foot-diameter mirror made of aluminum-coated plastic foil , beaming bursts of reflected sunlight down upon a series of cities around the globe , from Quebec City to Karaganda , Kazakhstan .
The experiment Thursday night marks a major step forward in a strange , wildly ambitious and environmentally controversial Russian project .
The ultimate goal is to eventually launch batteries of gigantic -- and potentially hugely profitable -- space mirrors into orbit to serve as cosmic spotlights , illuminating the long , dark winters of northern latitudes .
Such artifical moons , say Russian designers of the futuristic scheme , could eventually save energy and cheer up the lives of people dwelling in the far north of Russia , Canada and other realms where the sun hardly shines through the winter , and where alcoholism and depression are common .
More prosaically , space mirrors could be used simply to extend `` daytime '' in northern urban centers , eventually adding an hour or two of light for commuters and shoppers in Montreal , Moscow or even Boston .
But astronomers around the world are aghast at the plan , and bitterly oppose the space project as a threat to sensitive telescopes and other astronomical gear that enable humans to peer to the far edges of the universe .
`` This first experiment is a novelty , and perhaps harmless , '' said Michael De Robertis , professor of astronomy at Ontario 's York University and president of the Canadian Astronomical Society .
`` But the bigger plan is very alarming .
It could literally blind telescopes .
It has potential to seriously compromise astronomical research . ''
Kelly Beatty , senior editor of Sky and Telescope , a Cambridge , Mass .
magazine covering astronomical issues , put it more bluntly : `` The result could be horrific destruction of the night skies . ''
To some dwellers in the frozen north , however , the project sounds pretty good .
`` Just tell us where to sign up for some of that outer space sunshine , '' said Jason Kilabuk , social counselor in the Inuit settlement of Iqaluit in Canada 's Northwest Territories .
`` The cold is n't really the problem up here .
It 's the long days of darkness -- that 's what wears people down . ''
In the experiment , scheduled to start over Russia in the morning and continue into the night over North America , cosmonauts aboard the Mir station plan to deploy the prototype space mirror -- named Znamya , or Banner -- and beam down shafts of reflected sunshine during a series of orbits over a 13-hour span .
After the experiment , the silvery contraption will fall back toward earth and burn up in the atmosphere .
The cosmonauts will attempt to aim bursts of light at a series of population centers around the north , including Calgary , Alberta ; Winnipeg , Manitoba ; Frankfurt , Germany ; Poltava , Ukraine ; and Saratov , Russia .
During the test run , the Znamya mirror is expected to throw light beams 10 times brighter than the full moon onto target areas measuring about five square miles .
The only United States community that may be directly illuminated by the bounced light is Devils Lake , N.D. `` Our mirror will look like the brightest star in the sky , '' space engineer Vladimir Syromyatnikov , the 66-year -old Russian visionary behind the experiment , told reporters in Moscow several weeks ago .
`` You wo n't be able to look at it without squinting your eyes . ''
The ray falling on Quebec City , the nearest Earth target to New England , is scheduled to be beamed down at 6 : 56 p.m .
The consortium of Russian aerospace companies operating the project hopes over the next decade , beginning in year 2003 , to place a necklace of hundreds of space mirrors into higher , semi-permanent orbit .
These would be much larger versions of the Znamya prototype -- each roughly the size of a football field -- and , in theory , capable of bathing whole cities in light equivalent to that of a brightly illuminated parking lot .
The experiment is to determine whether the beams can be kept focused on a particular place on the earth .
`` If it is successful , it would be a major step foward in the ability of the Russians to control these huge and fragile mirrors in outer space , '' said Beatty .
`` They hope to orient these mirrors the way a stagehand points a spotlight . ''
The Paris -based International Astronomical Union plans to protest the project before the United Nations and has already fired off concerned letters to Moscow claiming that efforts to probe the universe will be drastically curtailed by the explosion of night light .
`` It 's technology run amok , '' said astronomer Woodruff T. Sullivan of the University of Washington , heading the assessment of the orbiting mirrors for the worldwide body of professional astronomers .
The Russian consortium has been vague about its plans , but most analysts are convinced the ultimate goal is profit .
The expectation is the Russians and their financial backers hope to sell the beams , whether to Canadian cities seeking a longer day or to commercial interests -- mine operators , say , or construction teams -- that could use extra hours of working light .
Oddly , given the enormity of the project , it has received very little attention in North America and Europe .
`` We have heard nothing at all about this , '' said a Canadian official with expertise in technology and international affairs .
`` Are you sure this is n't some sort of science fiction fantasy ?
It does n't sound plausible . ''
