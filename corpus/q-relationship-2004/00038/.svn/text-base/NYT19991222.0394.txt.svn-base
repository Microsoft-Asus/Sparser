SEOUL , South Korea --
Daewoo Motor Co. became the object of a potential bidding brawl between the world 's two largest automakers Wednesday after the South Korean government decided to solicit offers instead of negotiate with a single buyer .
The government , which is overseeing Daewoo Motor 's sale as part of a broader dismantling of the Daewoo Group , the insolvent conglomerate , decided to auction the automaker after Ford Motor Co. expressed interest in buying it .
Earlier , the government had indicated it might bargain exclusively with General Motors Corp. , which said last week that it wanted to buy Daewoo Motor .
It is unclear how much buyers ultimately would be willing to pay for Daewoo Motor , which carries more than $ 16 billion of Daewoo Group 's estimated $ 78 billion in debts .
But GM reportedly had offered as much as $ 7 billion for Daewoo Motor 's assets , and the assumption of an unspecified amount of the debt .
For both Ford and GM , the acquisition of Daewoo Motor would offer an instant expansion of their manufacturing and marketing in Asia , which has rebounded from a 1997 economic crisis and is now considered a most promising region for increased vehicle sales .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- The Financial Supervisory Commission , the government agency responsible for the sale of Daewoo Motor , said it would `` take place through a method where an investor with the best advantages , selected from their letters of intent , will be given exclusive negotiating rights . ''
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- GM declined to comment on the government 's decision , but it is clearly a setback for the automaker , which had hoped to reach a deal without rival interference by negotiating an exclusive contract quickly .
Ford said it intended to step up negotiations with Daewoo Motor 's South Korean creditors .
Jim Bright , a Ford Motor spokesman in Detroit , said that Paul Drenkow , a senior Ford manager in the Asia - Pacific region , would lead a group meeting in early January with Daewoo Motor 's main creditor , Korea Development Bank .
`` Projected growth in the global auto industry is going to occur in other places than in North America and Europe , and most of that growth is going to occur in Asia , '' Bright said .
`` We 're definitely interested in Daewoo Motor . ''

When Ford began a serious bid for Kia Motor Corp. , GM flirted briefly with that bankrupt company until Hyundai Motor Co. beat Ford in October 1998 .
South Korea has spent the last year recovering from the Asian economic crisis and car sales this year have doubled since the peak of the recession in 1998 , nearly catching up with levels seen just before the crisis began in 1997 .
Combined domestic and overseas car sales by Daewoo , Hyundai and Kia totaled more than 300,000 vehicles last month .
Ranked by automobile sales , South Korea is second only to Japan in the Asian market .
