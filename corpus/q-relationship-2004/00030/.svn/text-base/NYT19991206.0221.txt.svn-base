MONTREAL --
A decade after the murder of 14 women by a deranged gunman at a university here , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Canadians are grappling with the massacre 's legislative legacy , strict federal laws that mandate registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners</ENAMEX> .
In what many gun control advocates hope will be a North American beachhead for tighter controls on firearms , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">all Canadian gun owners must obtain licenses by the end of next year and they must register their guns by the end of 2002</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Similar to laws passed in Britain and Australia following mass shootings there , Canada 's tightened gun controls followed the worst mass shooting in this country 's modern history</ENAMEX> .
Here , on Dec.. 6 , 1989 , Marc Lepine , a 25-year -old unemployed loner , stalked through three floors of an engineering building at the University of Montreal .
Carrying a semi-automatic rifle , he targeted women , shooting 23 and killing 14 .
He also shot and injured four men .
Lepine , whose applications had been rejected by the Canadian military and by the engineering school , then committed suicide , leaving behind a note : `` Feminists have ruined my life . ''
Canadians had long thought that such mindless violence only occurred south of the border .
`` We were all shocked out of our complacency to action , '' said Heidi Rathgen , a survivor of the shooting who went on to help found Coalition for Gun Control , the lead group that battled for tighter controls .
Although public opinion favored stricter laws , the battle for gun registration and licensing turned into a bitter political fight .
On Sunday , Ms. Rathgen recalled after inaugurating a memorial near the engineering school , `` We won because we remembered , because we never gave up , because we did n't go away . ''
Public opinion polls by Gallup Canada indicate that support for the new National Firearms Registry has increased since enabling legislation was passed in 1995 , rising from 64 percent in 1995 to 73 percent in a poll taken six weeks ago .
Support is strongest , 88 percent , here in Quebec , where many students were given Monday off to attend memorials , concerts , symposiums and marches .
But , in Canada 's West , support in the Gallup poll was only 54 percent of respondents .
And it is in Canada 's West and North , regions with the nation 's highest rates of gun ownership , that a very un- Canadian movement is brewing : civil disobedience .
`` The vast majority of people that I have spoken to have said flat out , ` I will not register , I just wo n't do it ' , '' said Ray Laycock , a founder of the National Firearms Association , a gun-rights group , in a telephone interview from Calgary .
In the year since the new law took effect , on Dec. 1 , 1998 , only 184,808 of Canada 's estimated 3 million gun owners have applied for licenses .
As for Canada 's estimated 7 million firearms , 264,464 gun registrations were approved over the last year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Canadians have had to register revolvers and pistols since 1934</ENAMEX> .
Some Canadian gun owners say they are boycotting the registry system because they believe it is a first step toward restricting gun ownership to the police and military .
Others seem to be procrastinating , waiting for Canada 's Supreme Court to decide on a challenge to the law , which is to be argued in February .
Arguing that gun control is a provincial and territorial , not federal , right , the challenge is backed by Alberta , Manitoba , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Saskatchewan , Yukon , and Northwest Territories .
According to a survey by the Firearms Center , about 40 percent of Canadian gun owners rarely use their guns and would probably sell or destroy them to avoid registration .
To Wendy Cukier , president of the Coalition for Gun Control , this would make for a safer Canada .
`` Where you have more guns , you have more gun deaths , '' said Ms. Cukier , a professor of justice studies in Toronto .
In an essay last year in a Canadian public health magazine , she contrasted American and Canadian statistics for gun ownership and gun deaths in the mid-1990s .
She found that the United States had 3.5 times the number of firearms per capita as Canada and 3.6 times the number of deaths by firearms as Canada .
The American rate for murder by firearms was 15 times higher than the Canadian rate .
She concluded : `` You are hard pressed to explain the difference in firearms deaths without touching on the availability of guns . ''
