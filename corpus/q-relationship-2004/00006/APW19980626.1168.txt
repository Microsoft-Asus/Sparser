With Russian help , India plans to build its first nuclear-powered submarine by 2004 and eventually fit it with missiles carrying nuclear warheads , an Indian researcher said Friday .
The work would be in line with expectations that , following last month 's series of nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan , the South Asian arms race would shift to developing means to deliver the weapons .
Two reports in the latest issue of the British -based Jane 's Intelligence Review focused on a key element of India 's planned delivery system .
The reports were by Bombay -based science writer Gopi Rethinaraj and Andrew Koch , a senior research analyst at the Center for Defense Information in Washington .
India has said it needs a nuclear defense to counter the nuclear capability of neighbors China and Pakistan , with which it has fought a total of four wars in the last 50 years .
India accuses China of supporting Pakistan 's nuclear program .
Discussing his research in an interview , Rethinaraj said he believed India would have the submarine 's hull and reactor in place by the end of this year and would complete integration of the components by 2004 .
A fleet of five Indian submarines is planned , Jane 's said , making India the only country outside the five official nuclear weapons states -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- to operate nuclear submarines .
Since conventional submarines need to surface at least once a week to draw oxygen to run diesel generators , they can be easily detected .
Nuclear submarines , however , can stay submerged for more than three months , and it is considered safer for them to carry nuclear weapons because they are harder to detect .
Rethinaraj said India would arm its subs with nuclear warhead missiles , but not immediately .
Analysts estimated production of Sagarika missiles , which can be fired underwater , would begin by 2005 .
India 's nuclear submarines are to be propelled by a pressurized water reactor burning enriched uranium fuel .
A land -based prototype of the submarine 's engine has been tested at Kalpakkam in southern India , according to Rethinaraj and Koch .
Russian assistance to the Indian project is mainly in non-nuclear areas such as hull design and underwater navigation , the report said .
It said Russia is also helping India develop the Sagarika missiles and supplying a limited amount of turbojet and guidance technology .
Jane 's said Russia was given a dlrs 2.6 billion contract to build two nuclear power reactors in southern India in exchange for its help on the submarine project .
The contract was signed five days ago .
The United States maintained the reactor deal sent `` the wrong signal at the wrong time , '' coming soon after international sanctions were imposed to punish India for its nuclear tests .
But Russia assured India it would brook no outside interference in their economic relationship .
Russia sees India as a prime source of revenue , and India is keen to improve its power generating capacity .
