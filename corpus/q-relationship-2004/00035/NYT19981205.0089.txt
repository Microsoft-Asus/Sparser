CARACAS , Venezuela --
The podium rose two stories above the multitude , but `` El Comandante , '' Hugo Chavez , floated higher .
Standing in a box draped to look like a balcony , raised by a mechanical lift , he swept his arm way over his head , vowing to throw out Venezuela 's legendary corruption in one swift and forceful toss .
`` We 're witnessing a real revolution , which cannot be stopped by anything or anybody , '' Chavez , a fiery 44-year -old former military leader turned presidential candidate , told a crowd of 700,000 at his closing campaign rally Wednesday night .
Many wore the red beret of the military special forces , as he did , as a sign of support .
`` We have a popular avalanche , '' Chavez intoned , predicting he would win with 60 percent to 80 percent of the vote .
To business leaders and international investors , Chavez is the red menace resurrected .
To the poor , he is the impatient savior who is already smashing the clubby machine of mutual favors at the top of Venezuelan politics .
Chavez , who tried to storm the presidential palace in a failed coup attempt six years ago , is the front-runner in elections for the presidency Sunday .
In some half-dozen voter surveys , he is leading by upward of 15 points over his nearest opponent , a silver-haired two-time governor of Carabobo state , Enrique Salas Roemer .
Chavez spent two years in jail after the coup attempt , but was released in 1994 , when President Rafael Caldera , who was leaving office , dropped the charges against him .
At that time , Chavez visited Cuba and praised President Fidel Castro and `` the Cuban way . ''
There have also been reports of direct contacts with the leftist rebels in Colombia , Venezuela 's neighbor to the west , which Chavez has denied .
Both Chavez and Salas have been vague on economic plans , and both criticize the traditional party machinery .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But Chavez 's role in trying to overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres Perez , his vitriolic oratory and his support for Cuba have terrified upper-class Venezuelans , who have been sending their money and other assets out of the country for fear of a Chavez victory .</ENAMEX>
Wearing the black shirt and the red beret of the special forces , Chavez noted his record as a `` warrior '' at the rally .
`` Clearly , today I am a warrior for peace , fighting for true democracy , '' he said , `` but combatants we are .
We are making this war for Venezuela .
We do it in peace , but we are warriors . ''
As he has gained in popularity , Chavez has moderated his talk , in some instances contradicting earlier statements .
He more recently said he is `` neither for savage capitalism , nor socialism , nor communism , '' but for a gentler kind of capitalism .
Talk of election-day fraud by the traditional party machinery , of a backup plan by Chavez to seize power violently and of post-ballot rioting is rampant here .
There have been reports of opponents listed for reprisals after election day and of another list of journalists deemed `` shootable '' by the Chavez leadership .
`` There is no proof ; there are rumors , '' Chavez told a television interviewer the day after his campaign rally .
`` The only plan that we have is to pull Venezuela out of this mess .
All of us are democrats . ''
He said that after election , he hoped the opposition would `` drop this fear , this dirty war . ''
The United States has denied him a visa but has said it will work with whoever wins the election .
Analysts close to the Chavez campaign said his team had made overtures to U.S. officials , and discussed a post-election visit to New York and Washington .
Supporters and detractors of Chavez agree on one point : The rise of the would-be strongman is a symptom of the Venezuelan government 's sustained neglect of most of the population , something that has given democracy a bad name here .
Though Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil to the United States , four out of five Venezuelans live in poverty .
Some 40 percent are in dire poverty , which means they are malnourished .
For many Venezuelans , the sole explanation for the overwhelming misery despite the country 's oil wealth is corruption , which has indeed flowered .
Venezuela 's democracy , which began in 1958 , ended 150 years of dictatorship .
Most Venezuelans , however , do not see the elite 's mutual back-scratching as a stage on the road to better government , but as democracy 's final stop .
A series of governments has nourished stability , but little more , say Chavez supporters .
The clarion call of this year 's campaign is change , short of revolution .
While Salas promises change , Chavez -- with his booming denunciations of `` los corruptos '' and his pledge to `` fry '' the heads of the political bigwigs -- embodies it .
`` We 've lived under tyranny , corruption and manipulation of the people for 40 years , '' said Irma Guzman , 56 , a journalist cheering at the Chavez rally .
`` A country in which corruption is rooted in the political leadership is a dictatorship . ''
`` For 40 years , '' she said , `` they 've robbed our children 's right to an education , to food , to health care . ''
`` To life ! '' added Efrain Cedeno , the 39-year -old director of a theater group , who was standing nearby .
`` El Comandante , '' as Chavez is known , has already caused the collapse of the entrenched party system , led by the Democratic Action and Copei parties .
Democratic Action , until now the kingmaker in Venezuelan politics , dumped its longtime party boss and presidential candidate , Luis Alfaro Ucero , the week before last .
Ucero was defiant , saying he would hold on to the nomination , and was expelled from the party , which threw its support behind Salas .
Copei also dropped its support for Irene Saez , a former Miss Universe trailing in the polls , and backed Salas .
Even those terrified at the prospect of a Chavez victory , who have sent their paintings , jewelry and other treasures to Miami , concede that there is truth to the popular indictment of Venezuelan politics , said Eric Ekvall , a political consultant here .
`` This interlocking system of privileges and graft that runs Venezuela would n't last a half-hour with a RICO grand jury , '' Ekvall said , referring to the U.S. law for prosecuting organized crime .
`` It 's a racket and has been run like a racket for a very long time . ''
Chavez has pledged to hold a referendum with the aim of rewriting the 1961 Constitution , and threatened to jail anybody who opposed the Constitutional Assembly .
The limits of the Assembly 's power and mandate , however , have not been clear .
Some fear Chavez may use the Assembly to oust the Congress and state governors , many of whom have defied him in backing Salas .
There is also widespread fear of reprisals against critics and of the possible ending of civil liberties like free expression .
But in the bare-knuckles battle that this election has become , it is difficult to separate fear from smear .
Economically , Venezuela is reeling , with oil prices under $ 10 a barrel , the lowest in 25 years .
Chavez has promised to abide by past oil exploration contracts , but warned that he would review the terms of any coming privatizations .
Critics also fear that he will raise protectionist barriers and -- in the worst case -- institute exchange and price controls .
Some are troubled by what they consider the message behind Chavez 's tirades .
His speeches attack all of the last 40 years , even though Venezuela 's standard of living rose during the 1960s and ' 70s , as the country wiped out malaria and improved literacy and life expectancy .
That makes Venezuelans like Daniel Benaim , the owner of an advertising and television production concern , wonder whether Chavez 's true enemy is not corruption , but democracy .
Benaim said his `` sixth sense '' went on alert after an anonymous caller threatened his father , Victor Benaim , a leading gynecologist and inveterate critic of the political scene .
His father , who is 74 , had reprinted an article against Chavez and was handing it out to patients .
Benaim described the incident in an electronic letter that he sent to 10 friends , some of whom are journalists .
It spread widely , and soon after , he began receiving threats as well .
Now he has obtained a green card and , like many upper-class Venezuelans , plans to move to the United States if necessary , leaving behind his house and his company , which employs 40 people .
`` I 've already gotten to the point where I know that if I have to leave , it 'll be the Cuban way , with only whatever I 've been able to get into a foreign bank account , '' he said .
