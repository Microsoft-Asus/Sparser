In his first policy speech before Parliament since becoming prime minister last week , Keizo Obuchi said he would continue the progress in ties with Moscow begun under the previous administration .
`` I will do my utmost to completely normalize Japan - Russian relations by strengthening ties in various fields and by concluding a peace treaty by 2000 , '' said Obuchi , a former foreign minister .
The premier also said he would like to visit Russia sometime in the fall .
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura is reportedly planning a trip to Moscow in September .
Within the past year , then- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held two summits .
The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II , mainly because of a disagreement over control of the Kuril Islands , claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the end of the war .
