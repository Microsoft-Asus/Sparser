HONG KONG , June 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Hospital of Gun Club Hill Barracks of the People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- Hong Kong Garrison greeted some 400 officers and soldiers , who arrived here early Wednesday morning to give blood .
Sponsored by the Barracks Hospital and the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service , the blood donation is the third one since the PLA troops were stationed in the Hong Kong SAR in 1997 .
The officers and soldiers , from the ground , navy and air forces of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison , were all in high spirits and took the blood test and transfusion with the help of the doctors from the Blood Transfusion Service .
`` The PLA troops organize the biggest number of donors and offer the most amount of blood in Hong Kong each year , '' said Dr. Lin Che Kit , hospital chief executive of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service .
`` It is not easy to organize as many as 400 persons to give blood in such efficiency . ''
He said the PLA officers and soldiers are treated the same as Hong Kong residents in giving blood , and each person whose weight is over 50 kilograms gives 450 cc blood .
As blood supply in summer is usually less than other seasons , the blood donated by the 400 PLA officers and soldiers will help maintain a sound blood supply in Hong Kong , he noted .
