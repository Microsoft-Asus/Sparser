LONDON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A Bermuda -registered company said Tuesday it has reached an agreement to lease Russia 's Mir space station in a last-ditch effort to keep the orbiting platform alive .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MirCorp , which was formed in December , already has paid $ 20 million to $ 30 million to the station to keep it up in space at least through the summer , said its president , Jeffrey Manber .
He said another $ 40 million would need to be raised to keep the station afloat through the end of the year and beyond .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` We think that we can come up with clever imaginative ways to use a manned orbiting platform , '' Manber said</ENAMEX> in a telephone interview from Alexandria , Va .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` God bless NASA and all the government space agencies , but we want to unleash the full imagination of the private sector . ''</ENAMEX>
No Russian officials were immediately available for comment .
Mir has been flying without a crew since August , and <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">heavily indebted Russia had said it would abandon the station next month unless private investors came up with funding .</ENAMEX>
But in January , the Russian government approved a new mission that sent up a cargo ship earlier this month and is set to blast off with Russian cosmonauts on March 31 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The turnaround came after RKK Energia , which operates the station , said it had received some foreign funding .</ENAMEX>
No other details were disclosed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MirCorp said in a statement that as part of a new agreement , due to be signed Thursday in London , it would help fund that mission .</ENAMEX>
Under the lease agreement , Energia will continue to operate the station .
Energia is 38 percent owned by the Russian government and a majority shareholder in MirCorp , Manber said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">MirCorp will seek additional sponsors by offering the use of Mir for advertising purposes , space tourism and private scientific and pharmaceutical research , Manber said .
He also said the station could be used by private companies to broadcast live images of the Earth and to repair or manufacture space satellites .</ENAMEX>
`` We believe that Mir is worth $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion dollars because it is in space and it works , '' Manber said .
`` It sounds basic , but anything already in space is priceless compared to planning something on the ground . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In addition to appealing to corporate sponsors , Manber said he also hopes to attract people who see the romantic side of the Mir story -- a space station created by the former Soviet Union being saved by an international investor for commercial use .</ENAMEX>
