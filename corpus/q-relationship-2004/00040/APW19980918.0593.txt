A spokesman for Resources Minister Sen. Warwick Parer said the results were scientifically useless because the program is designed to show more fish than there actually are in the waters .
Japan said Wednesday that it fished a total of 1,363 tons of tuna in its program conducted in the Indian Ocean between July 10 and Aug. 31 .
The program , which tries to assess tuna stocks in waters where tuna boats do not usually operate , was carried out despite criticism by Australia and New Zealand , the two other members of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna .
An official at Japan 's Fisheries Agency said the program showed that tuna stocks were recovering .
The data will be analyzed by a group of Japanese scientists this year and will be offered to Australia and New Zealand , if they request it , he said .
Parer 's office welcomed Japan 's move to crack down on Flag of Convenience tuna vessels as `` a big positive step . ''
Flag of Convenience vessels , not operating under the flag of countries that have regional fisheries pacts , are creating loopholes in fishing quota agreements .
Non -commissioned catches of tuna around Australia by such ships have risen rapidly and are now estimated at around 5,000 tons annually .
The total annual quota for the three member countries of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna is 11,750 tons .
Some Japanese industry sources say 2,000 to 3,000 tons of Southern Bluefin Tuna caught by Flag of Convenience vessels are shipped to Japan every year .
The Japanese government is preparing legal action that would prevent Japanese fishermen from serving on Flag of Convenience vessels .
It is also attempting to prevent imports of fish caught by such vessels .
Negotiations over setting the quota for tuna fishing will continue among Japan , Australia and New Zealand after the Oct. 3 Australian election .
