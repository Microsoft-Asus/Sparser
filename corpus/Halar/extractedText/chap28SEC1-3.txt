A SAMPLE OF PROTISTAN DIVERSITY

 

 Diplomonadida and Parabasala: Diplomonads and parabasalids lack mitochondria



 

 Euglenozoa: The euglenozoa includes both photosynthetic and heterotrophic flagellates



 

 Alveolata: The alveolates are unicellular protists with subsurface cavities (alveoli)



 

 Stramenopila: The stramenopile clade includes the water molds and the heterokont algae



 

 Structural and biochemical adaptations help seaweeds survive and reproduce at the ocean's margins



 

 Some algae have life cycles with alternating multicellular haploid and diploid generations



 

 Rhodophyta: Red algae lack flagella



 

 Chlorophyta: Green algae and plants evolved from a common photoautotrophic ancestor



 

 A diversity of protists use pseudopodia for movement and feeding



 

 Mycetozoa: Slime molds have structural adaptations and life cycles that enhance their ecological roles as decomposers



 

 Multicellularity originated independently many times
