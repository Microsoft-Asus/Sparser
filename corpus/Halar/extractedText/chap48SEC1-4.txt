VERTEBRATE NERVOUS SYSTEMS

 

 Vertebrate nervous systems have central and peripheral components



 

 The divisions of the peripheral nervous system interact in maintaining homeostasis



 

 Embryonic development of the vertebrate brain reflects its evolution from three anterior bulges of the neural tube



 

 Evolutionarily older structures of the vertebrate brain regulate essential automatic and integrative functions



 

 The cerebrum is the most highly evolved structure of the mammalian brain



 

 Regions of the cerebrum are specialized for different functions



 

 Research on neuron development and neural stem cells may lead to new approaches for treating CNS injuries and diseases
