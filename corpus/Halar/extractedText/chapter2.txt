Like other animals, beetles have evolved structures and mechanisms that defend them from attack. As chemical ecologist Thomas Eisner described in the interview opening this unit, the soil-dwelling bombardier beetle has a particularly effective mechanism for dealing with the ants that plague it. Upon detecting an ant on its body, this beetle ejects a spray of boiling hot liquid from glands in its abdomen, aiming the spray directly at the ant. (In the photo on this page, the beetle aims its spray at Dr. Eisner's forceps.) The spray contains irritating chemicals that are generated at the moment of ejection by the explosive reaction of two sets of chemicals stored separately in the glands. The reaction produces heat and an audible pop.

Research on the bombardier beetle has involved chemistry, physics, and engineering, as well as biology. This is not surprising, for unlike a college catalog of courses, nature is not neatly packaged into the individual natural sciences. Biologists specialize in the study of life, but organisms and the world they live in are natural systems to which basic concepts of chemistry and physics apply. Biology is a multidisciplinary science.

This unit of chapters introduces key concepts of chemistry that will apply throughout our study of life. We will make many connections to the themes introduced in Chapter 1. One of those themes is the organization of life into a hierarchy of structural levels (FIGURE 2.1), with additional properties emerging at each successive level. In this unit, we will see how the theme of emergent properties applies to the lowest levels of biological organization--to the ordering of atoms into molecules and to the interactions of those molecules within cells. Somewhere in the transition from molecules to cells, we will cross the blurry boundary between nonlife and life.

The properties of chemical elements and of the compounds they form, including the compounds crucial to life, ultimately result from the structure of atoms.





 Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds

Organisms are composed of matter, which is anything that takes up space and has mass.* Matter exists in many diverse forms, each with its own characteristics. Rocks, metals, oils, gases, and you and I are just a few examples of what seems an endless assortment of matter.

Some of the ancient Greek philosophers believed that the great variety of matter arises from four basic ingredients, or elements. They believed these elements to be air, water, fire, and earth--supposedly pure substances that could not be decomposed to other forms of matter. All other substances were thought to be formed by blending various proportions of two or more of the elements. Although these ancient philosophers proposed the wrong elements, their basic idea was correct.

An element is a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions. Today, chemists recognize 92 elements occurring in nature; gold, copper, carbon, and oxygen are examples. Each element has a symbol, usually the first letter or two of its name. Some of the symbols are derived from Latin or German names; for instance, the symbol for sodium is Na, from the Latin word natrium.

A compound is a substance consisting of two or more elements combined in a fixed ratio. Table salt, for example, is sodium chloride (NaCl), a compound composed of the elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) in a 1:1 ratio. Pure sodium is a metal and pure chlorine is a poisonous gas. Chemically combined, however, sodium and chlorine form an edible compound. This is a simple example of organized matter having emergent properties: A compound has characteristics beyond those of its combined elements (FIGURE 2.2).

 Life requires about 25 chemical elements

About 25 of the 92 natural elements are known to be essential to life. Just four of these--carbon (C), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N)--make up 96%  of living matter. Phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and a few other elements account for most of the remaining 4%  of an organism's weight. TABLE 2.1 (p. 28) lists by percentage the elements that make up the human body; the percentages for other organisms are similar. FIGURE 2.3 (p. 28) illustrates the effect of nitrogen deficiency in a plant.

In this controlled experiment, the plants on the left are growing in soil that was fertilized with compounds containing nitrogen, an essential element. The soil on the right is deficient in nitrogen. If the poorly nourished crop growing in this deficient soil is harvested, it will yield less food--and less nutritious food--than the crop on the left.

Some trace elements, such as iron (Fe), are needed by all forms of life; others are required only by certain species. For example, in vertebrates (animals with backbones), the element iodine (I) is an essential ingredient of a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A daily intake of only 0.15 milligram (mg) of iodine is adequate for normal activity of the human thyroid. An iodine deficiency in the diet causes the thyroid gland to grow to abnormal size, a condition called goiter (FIGURE 2.4). Where it is available, iodized salt has reduced the incidence of goiter.

 Atomic structure determines the behavior of an element

Each element consists of a certain kind of atom that is different from the atoms of any other element. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element. Atoms are so small that it would take about a million of them to stretch across the period printed at the end of this sentence. We symbolize atoms with the same abbreviation used for the element made up of those atoms; thus, C stands for both the element carbon and a single carbon atom.

Subatomic Particles

Although the atom is the smallest unit having the properties of its element, these tiny bits of matter are composed of even smaller parts, called subatomic particles. Physicists have split the atom into more than a hundred types of particles, but only three kinds of particles are stable enough to be of relevance here: neutrons, protons, and electrons. Neutrons and protons are packed together tightly to form a dense core, or atomic nucleus, at the center of the atom. The electrons, moving at nearly the speed of light, form a cloud around the nucleus (FIGURE 2.5).

Fig 2-5. Two simplified models of a helium (He) atom. The helium nucleus consists of 2 neutrons (gray) and 2 protons (magenta). Two electrons move rapidly around the nucleus. In model (a), the electrons are represented as a cloud of negative charge. The cloud is not to scale; it is actually much bigger relative to the nucleus. In (b), the electrons are shown as small blue spheres; the circle indicates that their average distance from the nucleus is about two-thirds of the radius of the electron cloud. (Our model of an atom will be refined as the chapter progresses.)

Electrons and protons are electrically charged. Each electron has one unit of negative charge, and each proton has one unit of positive charge. A neutron, as its name implies, is electrically neutral. Protons give the nucleus a positive charge, and it is the attraction between opposite charges that keeps the rapidly moving electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.

The neutron and proton are almost identical in mass, each about 1.7 &#160;X&#160; 10-24 gram (g). Grams and other conventional units are not very useful for describing the mass of objects so minuscule. Thus, for atoms and subatomic particles (and for molecules, as well), we use a unit of measurement called the dalton, in honor of John Dalton, the British scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800. (The dalton is the same as the atomic mass unit, or amu, a unit you may have encountered elsewhere.) Neutrons and protons have masses close to 1 dalton. Because the mass of an electron is only about 1/2,000 that of a neutron or proton, we can ignore electrons when computing the total mass of an atom.

Atomic Number and Atomic Weight

Atoms of the various elements differ in their number of subatomic particles. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nuclei. This number of protons, which is unique to that element, is referred to as the atomic number and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol for the element. The abbreviation 2He, for example, tells us that an atom of the element helium has 2 protons in its nucleus. Unless otherwise indicated, an atom is neutral in electrical charge, which means that its protons must be balanced by an equal number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom.

We can deduce the number of neutrons from a second quantity, the mass number, which is the sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number is written as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, we can use this shorthand to write an atom of helium as 24He. Because the atomic number indicates how many protons there are, we can determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number: A 24He atom has 2 neutrons. An atom of sodium, 1123Na, has 11 protons, 11 electrons, and 12 neutrons. The simplest atom is hydrogen 11H, which has no neutrons; it consists of a lone proton with a single electron moving around it.

Almost all of an atom's mass is concentrated in its nucleus, because the contribution of electrons to mass is negligible. Because neutrons and protons each have a mass very close to 1 dalton, the mass number is an approximation of the total mass of an atom, usually called its atomic weight. So, we might say that the atomic weight of helium (24He) is 4 daltons, although more precisely it is 4.003 daltons.

Isotopes

All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, but some atoms have more neutrons than other atoms of the same element and therefore weigh more. These different atomic forms are referred to as isotopes of the element. In nature, an element occurs as a mixture of its isotopes. For example, consider the three isotopes of the element carbon, which has the atomic number 6. The most common isotope is carbon-12, 126C, which accounts for about 99%  of the carbon in nature. It has 6 neutrons. Most of the remaining 1%  of carbon consists of atoms of the isotope 136C, with 7 neutrons. A third, even rarer isotope, 146C, has 8 neutrons. Notice that all three isotopes of carbon have 6 protons--otherwise, they would not be carbon. Although isotopes of an element have slightly different masses, they behave identically in chemical reactions. (The number usually given as the atomic weight of an element is actually an average of the atomic weights of all the element's naturally occurring isotopes.)

Both 12C and 13C are stable isotopes, meaning that their nuclei do not have a tendency to lose particles. The isotope 14C, however, is unstable, or radioactive. A radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, radioactive carbon decays to form nitrogen.

Radioactive isotopes have many useful applications in biology. In Chapter 25, you will learn how researchers use measurements of radioactivity in fossils to date those relics of past life. Radioactive isotopes are also useful as tracers to follow atoms through metabolism, the chemical processes of an organism. Cells use the radioactive atoms as they would nonradioactive isotopes of the same element, but the radioactive tracers can be readily detected. FIGURE 2.6 shows two methods biologists use to monitor radioactive tracers.

Fig 2-6. Using radioactive isotopes to study cell chemistry. Scientists use radioactive isotopes to label certain chemical substances in order to follow a metabolic process or locate the substance within a cell or an organism. (a) This researcher is performing an experiment to determine how temperature affects the rate at which certain cells make new copies of their DNA. First, the cells are placed in a medium that includes the ingredients for making DNA. One ingredient is labeled with 3H, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Any new DNA the cells make will incorporate 3H. Separate samples of the cells in their radioactive medium are incubated at different temperatures. After an allotted amount of time, samples are taken from each culture and their DNA is tested for radioactivity in a device called a scintillation counter (shown here). The DNA samples are placed in vials containing a fluid that emits flashes of light whenever radiation from the decay of the 3H tracer in the DNA excites chemicals in the fluid. The frequency of flashes, proportional to the amount of radioactive DNA present, is measured in counts per minute. When the counts for the various DNA samples are plotted against the temperature at which the cells were grown, as in the graph here, it is apparent that temperature dramatically affects the rate of DNA synthesis. This result might be useful to researchers studying the details of DNA synthesis. (b) A technique known as autoradiography can be used to locate the radioactively labeled DNA from part (a) within the cells. Thin slices of the cells are placed on glass slides and kept for some time in the dark covered by a layer of photographic emulsion. Radiation from the radioactive tracer present in any new DNA exposes the photographic emulsion, creating a pattern of black dots. In the photo, radioactive DNA in the cell on the left is clearly located in the cell's nucleus.

Radioactive tracers are important diagnostic tools in medicine. For example, certain kidney disorders can be diagnosed by injecting small doses of substances containing radioactive isotopes into the blood and then measuring the amount of tracer excreted in the urine. Radioactive tracers are also used in combination with sophisticated imaging instruments, such as PET scanners, which can monitor chemical processes as they actually occur in the body (FIGURE 2.7).

Fig 2-7. A PET scan, --a medical use for radioactive isotopes. PET, an acronym for positron-emission tomography, detects locations of intense chemical activity in the body. The patient is first injected with a nutrient such as glucose labeled with a radioactive isotope that emits subatomic particles called positrons. The positrons collide with electrons made available by chemical reactions in the body. A PET scanner detects the energy released in these collisions and maps as "hot spots" the regions of an organ that are most chemically active at the time. The color of the image varies with the amount of the isotope present in an area. In this image the bright yellow color identifies cancerous bone tissue in the patient's spine and at the bottom of one shoulder blade.

Although radioactive isotopes are very useful in biological research and medicine, radiation from decaying isotopes also poses a hazard to life by damaging cellular molecules. The severity of this damage depends on the type and amount of radiation an organism absorbs. One of the most serious environmental threats is radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents (FIGURE 2.8).

Fig 2-8. The Tokaimura nuclear accident. In 1999, workers at a nuclear power plant in Tokaimura, Japan, accidentally triggered a chain reaction that leaked large amounts of radioactivity into the surroundings. The accident exposed 46 workers in the plant to dangerous radiation doses. A mile from the plant, radiation levels peaked at 15,000 times higher than normal. About 300,000 people in nearby towns were checked for radioactive contamination, as shown here, and will continue to be monitored for possible long-term damage, such as cancers.

The Energy Levels of Electrons

The simplified models of the atom in FIGURE 2.5 greatly exaggerate the size of the nucleus relative to the volume of the whole atom. If the nucleus were the size of a golf ball, the electrons would be moving about the nucleus at an average distance of approximately 1 kilometer (km). Atoms are mostly empty space.

When two atoms approach each other during a chemical reaction, their nuclei do not come close enough to interact. Of the three kinds of subatomic particles we have discussed, only electrons are directly involved in the chemical reactions between atoms.

An atom's electrons vary in the amount of energy they possess. Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Potential energy is the energy that matter stores because of its position or location. For example, because of its altitude, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy. When the gates of the reservoir's dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy comes out of storage to do work, such as turning generators. Because potential energy has been expended, the water stores less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move to the lowest possible state of potential energy; in this example, water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity.

The electrons of an atom also have potential energy because of their position in relation to the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus; the more distant the electrons are from the nucleus, the greater their potential energy. Unlike the continuous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain discrete amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase. The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. An electron cannot exist in between its fixed states of potential energy.

The different states of potential energy that electrons have in an atom are called energy levels, or electron shells (FIGURE 2.9). The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the lowest energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, electrons in the third shell more energy still, and so on. An electron can change its shell, but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between the old shell and the new shell. To move to a shell farther out from the nucleus, the electron must absorb energy. For example, light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. (Indeed, this is the first step when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water.) To move to a shell closer to the nucleus, an electron must lose energy, which is usually released to the environment in the form of heat. For example, when sunlight excites electrons in the paint of a dark car roof to higher energy levels, the roof heats up as the electrons fall back to their original levels.

Fig 2-9. Energy levels of an atom's electrons. Electrons exist only at fixed levels of potential energy, which are also called electron shells. An electron can move from one level to another only if the energy it gains or loses is exactly equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. Arrows indicate some of the stepwise changes in potential energy that are possible.

Electron Configuration and Chemical Properties

The chemical behavior of an atom is determined by its electron configuration--that is, the distribution of electrons in the atom's electron shells. Beginning with hydrogen, the simplest atom, we can imagine building the atoms of the other elements by adding 1 proton and 1 electron at a time (along with an appropriate number of neutrons). FIGURE 2.10, an abbreviated version of what is called a periodic table, shows this distribution of electrons for the first 18 elements, from hydrogen (1H) to argon (18Ar). The elements are arranged in three rows, or periods, corresponding to the number of electron shells in their atoms. The left-to-right sequence of elements in each row corresponds to the sequential addition of electrons (and protons).

Fig 2-10. Electron configurations of the first 18 elements. In these diagrams, electrons are shown as blue dots and energy levels (electron shells) as concentric rings. The elements are arranged in rows, each representing the filling of an electron shell. As electrons are added, they occupy the lowest available shell. Hydrogen's 1 electron and helium's 2 electrons are located in the first shell. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell (the lowest available shell). The outermost energy level occupied by electrons is called the valence shell. Elements with the same number of valence electrons--fluorine and chlorine, for instance--have similar chemical properties.

Hydrogen's 1 electron and helium's 2 electrons are located in the first shell. Electrons, like all matter, tend to exist in the lowest available state of potential energy, which they have in the first shell. However, the first shell can hold no more than 2 electrons. An atom with more than 2 electrons must use higher shells because the first shell is full. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two of these electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell. The second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons. Neon, at the end of the second row, has 8 electrons in the second shell, giving it a total of 10 electrons.

The chemical behavior of an atom depends mostly on the number of electrons in its outermost shell. We refer to those outer electrons as valence electrons and to the outermost electron shell as the valence shell. In the case of lithium, there is only 1 valence electron, and the second shell is the valence shell. Atoms with the same number of electrons in their valence shells exhibit similar chemical behavior. For example, fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) both have 7 valence electrons, and both combine with the element sodium to form compounds (see FIGURE 2.2). An atom with a completed valence shell is unreactive; that is, it will not interact readily with other atoms it encounters. At the far right of the periodic table are helium, neon, and argon, the only three elements shown in FIGURE 2.10 that have full valence shells. These elements are said to be inert, meaning chemically unreactive. All the other atoms in FIGURE 2.10 are chemically reactive because they have incomplete valence shells.

Electron Orbitals

Early in the 20th century, the electron shells of an atom were visualized as concentric paths of electrons orbiting the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun. It is still convenient to use concentric-circle diagrams to symbolize electron shells, as in FIGURE 2.10. The atom is not this simple, however. In fact, we can never know the exact path of an electron. What we can do instead is describe the space in which an electron spends most of its time. The three-dimensional space where an electron is found 90%  of the time is called an orbital. Each electron shell consists of a specific number of orbitals of specific shapes (FIGURE 2.11).

Fig 2-11. Electron orbitals. The three-dimensional shapes in the top half of this figure represent electron orbitals--the volumes of space where the electrons of an atom are most likely to be found. Each orbital holds a maximum of 2 electrons. The bottom half of the figure shows the equivalent electron-shell diagrams. (a) The first electron shell has one spherical (s) orbital, designated 1s. Only this orbital is occupied in hydrogen, which has 1 electron, and helium, which has 2 electrons. (b) The second and all higher shells each have one larger s orbital (designated 2s for the second shell) plus three dumbbell-shaped orbitals called p orbitals (2p for the second shell). The three 2p orbitals lie at right angles to one another along imaginary x, y, and z axes of the atom. (The third and higher electron shells can hold additional electrons in orbitals of more complex shapes.) (c) To symbolize the electron orbitals of the element neon, which has a total of 10 electrons, we superimpose the 1s orbital of the first shell and the 2s and three 2p orbitals of the second shell. (Each orbital, remember, can hold 2 electrons.)

No more than 2 electrons can occupy the same orbital. The first electron shell has a single orbital and can thereby accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons. This orbital, which is spherical in shape, is designated the 1s orbital. The lone electron of a hydrogen atom occupies the 1s orbital, as do the 2 electrons of a helium atom. The second electron shell has four orbitals and therefore can hold 8 electrons. Electrons in each of the four orbitals have nearly the same energy, but they move in different volumes of space. There is a 2s orbital, spherical in shape like the 1s orbital, but with a greater diameter. The other three orbitals, called 2p orbitals, are dumbbell-shaped. Each 2p orbital is oriented at right angles to the other two. (The third and higher electron shells also have s and p orbitals, as well as orbitals of more complex shapes.)

The reactivity of atoms arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals of their valence shells. Recall that the electronic configurations in FIGURE 2.10 build up with the addition of 1 electron at a time. Like strangers getting on a bus with seats for two, each additional electron occupies a separate orbital until no empty orbitals remain in a shell. Only then do the orbitals begin to receive a second electron. The paired dots in FIGURE 2.10 represent paired electrons sharing an orbital. When atoms interact to complete their valence shells, it is the unpaired electrons that are involved.





 Atoms combine by chemical bonding to form molecules

Now that we have looked at the structure of atoms, we can move up in the hierarchy of organization and see how atoms combine to form molecules. Atoms with incomplete valence shells interact with certain other atoms in such a way that each partner completes its valence shell. Atoms do this by either sharing or transferring valence electrons. These interactions usually result in atoms staying close together, held by attractions called chemical bonds. The strongest kinds of chemical bonds are covalent bonds and ionic bonds.

Covalent Bonds

A covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms. For example, let's consider what happens when two hydrogen atoms approach each other. Recall that hydrogen has 1 valence electron in the first shell, but the shell's capacity is 2 electrons. When the two hydrogen atoms come close enough for their 1s orbitals to overlap, they share their electrons (FIGURE 2.12a). Each hydrogen atom now has 2 electrons associated with it in what amounts to a completed valence shell. Two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds constitute a molecule. In this case, we have formed a hydrogen molecule. We can abbreviate the structure of this molecule as H--H, where the line represents a covalent bond--that is, a pair of shared electrons. This notation, which represents both atoms and bonding, is called a structural formula. We can abbreviate even further by writing H2, a molecular formula indicating simply that the molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen.

Fig 2-12. Covalent bonding in four molecules. A single covalent bond consists of a pair of shared electrons. The number of electrons required to complete an atom's valence shell generally determines how many bonds that atom will form.

With 6 electrons in its second electron shell, oxygen needs 2 more electrons to complete its valence shell. Two oxygen atoms form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons (FIGURE 2.12b). The atoms are thus joined by what is called a double covalent bond.

Each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds the atom can form. When the bonds form, they give the atom a full complement of valence electrons. The bonding capacity of oxygen, for example, is 2. This bonding capacity is called the atom's valence and generally equals the number of unpaired electrons in the atom's outermost (valence) shell. You can readily determine the valences of life's most abundant elements from the electron configurations in FIGURE 2.10: The valence of hydrogen is 1; oxygen, 2; nitrogen, 3; and carbon, 4. One more complicated case is phosphorus (P), another element important to life. Phosphorus can have a valence of 3, as we would predict from its 3 unpaired electrons. In biologically important molecules, however, it generally has a valence of 5, forming three single bonds and one double bond.

The molecules H2 and O2 are pure elements, not compounds. (Recall that a compound is a combination of two or more different elements.) An example of a molecule that is a compound is water, with the molecular formula H2O. It takes two atoms of hydrogen to satisfy the valence of one oxygen atom. FIGURE 2.12c shows the structure of a water molecule. Water is so important to life that Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to its structure and behavior.

Another molecule that is a compound is methane, the main component of natural gas, with the molecular formula CH4 (FIGURE 2.12d). It takes four hydrogen atoms, each with a valence of 1, to complement one atom of carbon, with its valence of 4. We will look at many other compounds of carbon in Chapter 4.

Nonpolar and Polar Covalent Bonds. The attraction of an atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself. In a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element, the outcome of the tug-of-war for common electrons is a standoff; the two atoms are equally electronegative. Such a bond, in which the electrons are shared equally, is a nonpolar covalent bond. The covalent bond of H2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O2. The bonds of methane (CH4) are also nonpolar; although the partners are different elements, carbon and hydrogen do not differ substantially in electronegativity. In other compounds, however, where one atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond will not be shared equally. This sort of bond is called a polar covalent bond. For example, the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are polar (FIGURE 2.13). Oxygen is one of the most electronegative of the 92 elements, attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than they do near the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative charge, the unequal sharing of electrons in water causes the oxygen atom to have a partial negative charge and each hydrogen atom a partial positive charge.

Fig 2-13. Polar covalent bonds in a water molecule. Oxygen, being much more electronegative than hydrogen, pulls the shared electrons of the covalent bonds toward itself, as indicated by the arrows. This unequal sharing of electrons gives the oxygen a partial negative charge and the hydrogens a partial positive charge. The Greek symbol delta (d) indicates that the charges are less than full units. This "space-filling" model approximates the true shape of H2O.

Ionic Bonds

In some cases, two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for valence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips an electron completely away from its partner. This is what happens when an atom of sodium (11Na) encounters an atom of chlorine (17Cl) (FIGURE 2.14). A sodium atom has a total of 11 electrons, with its single valence electron in the third electron shell. A chlorine atom has a total of 17 electrons, with 7 electrons in its valence shell. When these two atoms meet, the lone valence electron of sodium is transferred to the chlorine atom, and both atoms end up with their valence shells complete. (Because sodium no longer has an electron in the third shell, the second shell is now the valence shell.)

Fig 2-14. Electron transfer and ionic bonding. A valence electron can be transferred from sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl), giving both atoms completed valence shells. The electron transfer leaves the sodium atom with a net charge of +1 (cation) and the chlorine atom with a net charge of -1 (anion). The attraction between the oppositely charged atoms, or ions, is an ionic bond. Ions can bond not only to atoms with which they have reacted, but to any other ions of opposite charge.

The electron transfer between the two atoms moves one unit of negative charge from sodium to chlorine. Sodium, now with 11 protons but only 10 electrons, has a net electrical charge of +1. A charged atom (or molecule) is called an ion. When the charge is positive, the ion is specifically called a cation; the sodium atom has become a cation. Conversely, the chlorine atom, having gained an extra electron, now has 17 protons and 18 electrons, giving it a net electrical charge of -1. It has become a chloride ion--an anion, or negatively charged ion. Because of their opposite charges, cations and anions attract each other in what is called an ionic bond. Any two ions of opposite charge can form an ionic bond. The ions need not have acquired their charge by an electron transfer with each other.

Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called ionic compounds, or salts. We know the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl) as table salt (FIGURE 2.15). Salts are often found in nature as crystals of various sizes and shapes, each an aggregate of vast numbers of cations and anions bonded by their electrical attraction and arranged in a three-dimensional lattice. A salt crystal does not consist of molecules in the sense that a covalent compound does, because a covalently bonded molecule has a definite size and number of atoms. The formula for an ionic compound, such as NaCl, indicates only the ratio of elements in a crystal of the salt. "NaCl" is not a molecule.

Fig 2-15. A sodium chloride crystal. The sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are held together by ionic bonds. The formula NaCl tells us that the ratio of Na+ to Cl- is 1:1.

Not all salts have equal numbers of cations and anions. For example, the ionic compound magnesium chloride (MgCl2) has two chloride ions for each magnesium ion. Magnesium (12Mg) must lose 2 outer electrons if the atom is to have a complete valence shell, so it tends to become a cation with a net charge of +2 (Mg2+). One magnesium cation can therefore form ionic bonds with two chloride anions.

The term ion also applies to entire molecules that are electrically charged. In the salt ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), for instance, the anion is a single chloride ion (Cl-), but the cation is ammonium (NH4+), a nitrogen atom with four covalently bonded hydrogen atoms. The whole ammonium ion has an electrical charge of +1 because it is 1 electron short.

Environment affects the strength of ionic bonds. In a dry salt crystal, the bonds are so strong that it takes a hammer and chisel to break enough of them to crack the crystal in two. Place the same salt crystal in water, however, and the salt dissolves as the attractions between its ions decrease. In the next chapter, you will learn how water dissolves salts.





 Weak chemical bonds play important roles in the chemistry of life

In living organisms, most of the strongest chemical bonds are covalent ones, which link atoms to form a cell's molecules. But bonding between molecules is also indispensable in the cell, where the properties of life emerge from molecular interactions. When two molecules in the cell make contact, they may adhere temporarily by types of chemical bonds that are much weaker than covalent bonds. The advantage of weak bonding is that the contact between the molecules can be brief; the molecules come together, respond to one another in some way, and then separate.

The importance of weak bonding can be seen in the example of chemical signaling in the brain. One brain cell signals another by releasing molecules that use weak bonds to dock onto receptor molecules on the nearby surface of a receiving cell. The bonds last just long enough to trigger a momentary response by the receiving cell. If the signal molecules attached by stronger bonds, the receiving cell would continue to respond long after the transmitting cell ceased dispatching the message, with perhaps disastrous consequences. (Imagine what it would be like, for instance, if your brain continued to perceive the ringing sound of a bell for hours after nerve cells transmitted the information from the ears to the brain.)

Several types of weak chemical bonds are important in living organisms. One is the ionic bond, which is relatively weak in the presence of water. Another type of weak bond, crucial to life, is known as a hydrogen bond.

Hydrogen Bonds

Among the various kinds of weak chemical bonds, hydrogen bonds are so important in the chemistry of life that they deserve special attention. A hydrogen bond forms when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to one electronegative atom is also attracted to another electronegative atom. In living cells, the electronegative partners involved are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms.

Let's examine the simple case of hydrogen bonding between water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) (FIGURE 2.16). You have seen how the polar covalent bonds of water result in the oxygen atom having a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms having a partial positive charge. A similar situation arises in the ammonia molecule, where an electronegative nitrogen atom has a partial negative charge because of its pull on the electrons it shares covalently with hydrogen. If a water molecule and an ammonia molecule are close together, a weak attraction will occur between the negatively charged nitrogen atom and a positively charged hydrogen atom of the adjacent water molecule. This attraction is a hydrogen bond.

Van der Waals Interactions

Even a molecule with nonpolar covalent bonds may have positively and negatively charged regions. Because electrons are in constant motion, they are not always symmetrically distributed in the molecule; at any instant, they may accumulate by chance in one part of the molecule or another. The results are ever-changing "hot spots" of positive and negative charge that enable all atoms and molecules to stick to one another. These van der Waals interactions are weak and occur only when atoms and molecules are very close together.

Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak bonds may form not only between molecules but also between different regions of a single large molecule, such as a protein. Although these bonds are individually weak, their cumulative effect is to reinforce the three-dimensional shape of a large molecule. You will learn more about the biological roles of weak bonds in Chapter 5.





 A molecule's biological function is related to its shape

A molecule has a characteristic size and shape. The precise shape of a molecule is usually very important to its function in the living cell.

A molecule consisting of two atoms, such as H2 or O2, is always linear, but molecules with more than two atoms have more complicated shapes. These shapes are determined by the positions of the atoms' orbitals. When an atom forms covalent bonds, the orbitals in its valence shell rearrange. For atoms with valence electrons in both s and p orbitals (see FIGURE 2.11), the single s and three p orbitals hybridize to form four new orbitals shaped like identical teardrops extending from the region of the atomic nucleus (FIGURE 2.17a). If we connect the larger ends of the teardrops with lines, we have the outline of a pyramidal shape called a tetrahedron.

Fig 2-17. Molecular shapes due to hybrid orbitals. (a) The single s and three p orbitals of a valence shell involved in covalent bonding combine to form four teardrop-shaped hybrid orbitals. These orbitals extend to the four corners of an imaginary tetrahedron (outlined in magenta). (b) Because of the positions of the hybrid orbitals, the two covalent bonds of water are angled at 104.5&#176;. This is seen most clearly in the ball-and-stick model. The space-filling model comes closer to the actual shape of the molecule. (c) The hydrogens of methane occupy all four corners of the tetrahedron, giving methane a tetrahedral shape.

For the water molecule (H2O), two of the hybrid orbitals in the oxygen atom's valence shell are shared with hydrogen atoms (FIGURE 2.17b). The result is a molecule shaped roughly like a V, its two covalent bonds spread apart at an angle of 104.5&#176;.

The methane molecule (CH4) has the shape of a completed tetrahedron, because all four hybrid orbitals of carbon are shared (FIGURE 2.17c). The nucleus of the carbon is at the center, with its four covalent bonds radiating to hydrogen nuclei at the corners of the tetrahedron. Larger molecules containing multiple carbon atoms, including many of the molecules that make up living matter, have more complex overall shapes. However, the tetrahedral shape of a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms is often a repeating motif within such molecules.

Molecular shape is crucial in biology because it determines how most biological molecules recognize and respond to one another. For instance, in the chemical signaling example mentioned earlier, the signal molecules released by the transmitting brain cell have a unique shape that specifically fits together with the shape of the receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell, much as a key fits into a lock (FIGURE 2.18). This complementarity of shape aids the formation of weak bonds between the two molecules. The attachment of the signal molecule to the receptor molecule stimulates activity in the receptor cell. Molecules with shapes similar to those of the brain's signal molecules can affect mood and pain perception. Morphine, heroin, and other opiate drugs, for example, mimic natural signal molecules called endorphins (FIGURE 2.19). These drugs produce euphoria and relieve pain by binding to endorphin receptors in the brain. The role of molecular shape in brain chemistry is an example of the relationship of structure to function, one of biology's unifying themes.

The shape of the signal molecules is complementary to the shape of receptor molecules located on the surface of the receiving cell. The actual molecules have much more complex shapes than represented here.

The boxed portion of the endorphin molecule is recognized by receptor molecules on target cells in the brain. The boxed portion of the morphine molecule, an opiate drug, is a close match.





 Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds

The making and breaking of chemical bonds, leading to changes in the composition of matter, are called chemical reactions. An example is the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water:





This reaction breaks the covalent bonds of H2 and O2 and forms the new bonds of H2O. When we write a chemical reaction, we use an arrow to indicate the conversion of the starting materials, called reactants, to the products. The coefficients indicate the number of molecules involved; for example, the 2 in front of the H2 means that the reaction starts with two molecules of hydrogen. Notice that all atoms of the reactants must be accounted for in the products. Matter is conserved in a chemical reaction: Reactions cannot create or destroy matter but can only rearrange it.

Photosynthesis, which takes place within the cells of green plant tissues, is a particularly important example of chemical reactions rearranging matter. Humans and other animals ultimately depend on photosynthesis for food and oxygen, and this process is at the foundation of almost all ecosystems. Following is the chemical shorthand that summarizes the process of photosynthesis:


The raw materials of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide (CO2), which is taken from the air, and water (H2O), which is absorbed from the soil. Within the plant cells, sunlight powers the conversion of these ingredients to a sugar called glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen molecules (O2), a by-product that the plant releases into the surroundings (FIGURE 2.20). Although photosynthesis is actually a sequence of many chemical reactions, we still end up with the same number and kinds of atoms we had when we started. Matter has simply been rearranged.

Fig 2-20. Photosynthesis: a solar-powered rearrangement of matter. This Elodea, a freshwater plant, produces sugar by rearranging the atoms of carbon dioxide and water in the chemical process known as photosynthesis. Sunlight powers this chemical transformation. Much of the sugar is then converted to other food molecules. Oxygen gas (O2) is a by-product of photosynthesis; notice the bubbles of oxygen escaping from the leaves in the photo.

Some chemical reactions go to completion; that is, all the reactants are converted to products. But most reactions are reversible, the products of the forward reaction becoming the reactants for the reverse reaction. For example, hydrogen and nitrogen molecules can combine to form ammonia, but ammonia can also decompose to regenerate hydrogen and nitrogen:

The opposite-headed arrows indicate that the reaction is reversible.

One of the factors affecting the rate of a reaction is the concentration of reactants. The greater the concentration of reactant molecules, the more frequently they collide with one another and have an opportunity to react to form products. The same holds true for the products. As products accumulate, collisions resulting in the reverse reaction become increasingly frequent. Eventually, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and the relative concentrations of products and reactants stop changing. The point at which the reactions offset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium. This is a dynamic equilibrium; reactions are still going on, but with no net effect on the concentrations of reactants and products. Equilibrium does not mean that the reactants and products are equal in concentration, but only that their concentrations have stabilized. The reaction involving ammonia reaches equilibrium when ammonia decomposes as rapidly as it forms. In this case, there is far more ammonia than hydrogen and nitrogen at equilibrium.

We will return to the subject of chemical reactions after more detailed study of the various types of molecules that are important to life. In the next chapter, we focus on water, the substance in which all the chemical processes of living organisms occur.
