CARACAS , Venezuela
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Exit polls indicated that Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo Chavez 's `` social revolution '' Sunday by electing him to a new six-year term , consolidating Latin America 's second leftist regime after Cuba .
An exit poll conducted by El Nacional , a leading Venezuelan daily newspaper , gave Chavez 54 percent of the vote compared to 34 percent for his nearest challenger , former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas .
Another exit poll by the Internet portal terra.com.ve gave Chavez 57 percent to 39 percent advantage .
Neither poll indicated its sample size or methodology .
To the cheers of hundreds of supporters , a beaming Chavez cast his ballot in a Caracas suburb as voting opened Sunday across Venezuela .
`` A new republic is being born , '' the president said .
A new constitution Chavez pushed through after taking office last year required public offices to be `` re-legitimized '' through Sunday 's balloting for the presidency , a new 165-member unicameral legislature , governors , mayors and other offices .
Chavez , who has completely overhauled Venezuela 's institutions during his short term , has asked voters to look past sharp rises in crime and unemployment by re-electing him and giving his reform movement a majority in Congress .
Most Venezuelans seemed to believe Chavez when he vowed to refocus his revolution from its current emphasis on erasing the old political order to what matters most to the people : jobs and personal safety .
`` These problems ca n't be fixed in one day or one year , '' said Milagros Iguerara , a 50-year -old housewife standing in line to vote .
`` He is going to need five years or eight years . ''
Because of strong support among the poor majority of Venezuela 's 23 million people , Chavez , 46 , has enjoyed a strong advantage in the polls over Francisco Arias Cardenas , a former governor who helped Chavez lead a failed 1992 coup attempt but who broke away from the president this year .
The country 's poor overwhelmingly have put their faith in Chavez 's `` social revolution , '' while the bulk of the middle and upper classes , frightened by Chavez 's attacks on business and his coziness with Cuba , support Arias .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Chavez is a testament to previous governments ' failure to provide a decent standard of living in the world 's third-largest oil-exporting country -- and a reminder that not everyone accepts globalization and free markets as a model for society .
`` Hugo , I am sure that nothing and no one can stop you now , '' Cuban President Fidel Castro told Chavez in a chummy telephone conversation Saturday as Venezuelan journalists in Cuba interviewed the Cuban leader .</ENAMEX>
Even if Chavez wins , he could emerge from the voting with a weaker mandate .
Polls show the local races are closer than the presidential vote , with many of Chavez 's `` revolutionary '' candidates running close races with incumbents from traditional parties .
The president 's movement is expected to win at least a simple majority in the legislature .
But Chavez may fall short of the two-thirds needed to rubber-stamp presidential appointments and proposed laws .
And the governorships of nearly half of the country 's 23 states could go to the opposition .
Thousands of people waited in lines for hours in Sunday 's hot tropical sun to cast ballots filled with dozens of candidates and parties .
The national election board ordered polling stations to stay open an extra two hours to accommodate the crowds and to compensate for technical glitches that delayed voting in some areas .
Arias cast his ballot hundreds of miles to the west of Caracas in his home state of Zulia , where he served twice as governor .
The country 's fate is now `` in the hands of God and the hands of the Venezuelan people , '' Arias told reporters .
`` At stake is our way of life of liberty . ''
Arias wants to reverse what he calls Chavez 's militarization of Venezuelan society and take a friendlier stance with business leaders to attract foreign investment .
Chavez , through his fiery speeches attacking a `` rancid oligarchy , '' has rekindled hope among Venezuelans who have seen their standard of living steadily decline over the last two decades .
Arias has tried hard to shake his image as the candidate of the rich , but Chavez 's depiction of him as a `` counterrevolutionary '' has played well in the slums and shantytowns that are home to most Venezuelans .
