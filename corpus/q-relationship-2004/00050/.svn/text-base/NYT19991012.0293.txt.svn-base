BOGOTA , Colombia --
Though artists are usually advised to choose what they know as their subject matter , the risks of such a strategy here are obvious .
By any measurement , Colombia is one of the most violent countries in the world , with guerrillas , drug dealers , paramilitary groups and gangs of ordinary criminals all killing and kidnapping against the backdrop of a decades-long civil conflict in which more than 300,000 people have died .
But Gloria Zea , director of the Museum of Modern Art here , believes that no matter the dangers , `` artists cannot evade their moral and civic responsibilities . ''
So in an effort to provoke what she calls `` a profound and unhurried meditation '' that can `` help change behaviors and habits that impede civil discourse , '' her museum , the capital 's most prestigious , has organized the first systematic examination here of `` the scourge that has bled the country dry , '' as she puts it , in an unsettling exhibition entitled `` Art and Violence in Colombia Since 1948 . ''
Each of the show 's dozen sections , spread over four floors , addresses one specific manifestation of the violence that afflicts this nation of 40 million people : torture , kidnappings and disappearances , refugees , even `` The Mutilation of Corpses , '' as one section is called .
Some works are disturbingly graphic ; others , allegorical .
There are oils , sculptures , etchings , photographs and installations , including video displays .
But all , regardless of style or medium , have as their focus the barbarity , both politically and drug-inspired , that is tearing this society apart .
For Colombians , the decision to make 1948 the exhibition 's starting point is logical and needs no explanation .
On April 9 of that year , Jorge Eliecer Gaitan , the Liberal Party leader and the front-running presidential candidate , was assassinated , an act that touched off riots and a vicious civil war , known simply as `` La Violencia , '' that continued on and off until 1966 .
The show 's 50-year sweep is intended to provide historical perspective , but it also permits the organizers to do something else : chronicle the long and difficult search of Colombian artists for a creative language of their own .
An early work like Alejandro Obregon 's 1948 canvas `` The April 10 Massacre , '' for example , takes the form of a conventional abstract , powerful in its portrayal of destruction but still clearly derived from Picasso 's `` Guernica . ''
Similarly , Debora Arango 's 1953 portrait of Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla , the military dictator who had just come to power in a coup , resorts to the imagery of Hieronymous Bosch .
But as the decades passed and violence became more embedded in Colombian society , artists , particularly those who are now 35 to 50 years old and who have lived with savagery around them their entire lives , began to experiment with form and technique and to find new ways to express their anguish .
`` When we started to put this exhibition together 18 months ago , we intended to have 100 works by about 30 artists , with a focus on older , established artists , '' said Alvaro Medina , the chief curator of the show .
`` But when we began to investigate , we found that more younger artists than ever before are working this theme , and with great forcefulness , so we have ended up with some 150 works by about 50 different artists . ''
Critics and viewers seem to have been especially moved by `` What Was Left , '' a multimedia installation by Patricia Bravo , 33 , a artist from Medellin , a city notorious for its drug cartel and its sicarios , or freelance assassins .
In 1996 , a year in which 4,675 people died violently in that city , Ms. Bravo went to the scene of every bomb explosion and was allowed by the police to collect bits and pieces of the debris .
She then laminated the fragments onto 200 rectangular panels , which were then mounted on three walls near the main entrance of the museum .
The objects are ordinary ones from daily life -LRB- buttons , letters , a tape measure , ribbons , a child 's homework , a first communion card -RRB- but seem strangely totemic after being wrenched out of context not once but twice .
`` My work is much like that of an archeologist , an effort to document the relationship between human beings and their surroundings at a particularly difficult historical and political moment , '' Ms. Bravo said in an interview .
`` I wanted these vestiges of lives to be laminated and sealed so that they could be frozen in time as a testimonial to this very violent epoch we are living through . ''
In a four-minute video installation that has also drawn a strong response , Juan Manuel Echavarria uses the destruction of a plate belonging to Simon Bolivar as a metaphor for the national experience .
As an electronic dirge plays in the background , hammer blows smash the platter , which is engraved with the motto `` Republic of Colombia Forever , '' into ever smaller pieces until nothing is left but dust .
The dust then metamorphoses into a pile of cocaine .
`` I wanted the message to be clear , so that you do n't have to be initiated into the world of art to understand this work , '' Echavarria said .
`` I wanted people to feel an emotional as well as an intellectual response , to show how Bolivar 's dream has played out , how Colombia is coming apart .
I knew I had succeeded when one of our former presidents came to me after he saw the exhibition and said that my piece made his blood freeze . ''
Echavarria , 50 , is a novelist who took up photography four years ago , he said , `` out of desperation and frustration , because I would spend a month writing a page of fiction and not be able to find le mot juste '' to describe the brutality going on .
For one work , `` Florist 's Cuttings , '' he photographed human bones and then , in the manner of an 18th-century botanical expedition , labeled them in Latin with the names of forms of torture that are commonly employed here .
Literally overpowering is another multimedia installation , ironically entitled `` Musa Paradisiaca , '' a Latin phrase that means `` Heavenly Muse '' but that also refers to the scientific name for the banana .
In a dark room , Jose Alejandro Restrepo has hung bunches of green bananas from the ceiling and attached them to television screens .
The screens broadcast recorded news reports of clashes between government troops and guerrillas or attacks by paramilitary forces on remote villages .
In the small , enclosed space , the smell of the bananas ripening is sickeningly sulphurous , like the stench of death .
Bananas also figure in Victor Laignelet 's 1988 canvas `` Zone , '' a still-life that portrays two bunches of the fruit , one green , the other blood-red .
To Colombians , both works refer to the 1928 massacre of 1,000 striking banana workers , one of the most traumatic events in modern Colombian history , and also the source of a central episode in Gabriel Garcia Marquez 's novel `` One Hundred Years of Solitude . ''
The show includes nothing , though , by the country 's most renowned artist , Fernando Botero , who lives in Italy in self-imposed exile in part because of concerns for his own security .
But the 303-page catalog accompanying the exhibition depicts three Botero works : an early 1949 canvas called `` Woman Crying , '' a self-explanatory 1973 acrylic called `` The War '' and an untitled 1978 depiction of two policemen beating a pedestrian with nightsticks .
`` To bring Botero 's paintings back from overseas would have cost us at least $ 15,000 in insurance , and we did n't have that kind of money , because this is a moment of national crisis that finds most of our usual sponsors doing quite badly economically , '' Medina explained .
`` So we did n't even ask him . ''
The catalog , assembled by Medina and Ms. Zea , goes beyond paintings , sculptures and installations to includes essays that examine novels , plays and films that address the role of violence in Colombian life .
The museum has also sponsored panel discussions and debates open to the public , some of which have generated great controversy in the politically charged atmosphere here .
Two days before the show opened , in mid- May , in fact , the museum received telephone calls warning that curators would be killed unless the exhibition was canceled .
`` Nothing happened , '' Medina said , `` but I have to admit that we were in a state of fear and anxiety for a couple of days , and that when the news got out , some school groups decided to cancel the visits they had planned . ''
Despite such threats , more than 60,000 people saw the show during its initial three-month run .
As a result of the extraordinary impact it has had , there are now plans to remount the exhibition in at least two more Colombian cities .
Medina said similar offers had also been received from museums in Spain and France .
`` The main emotion I felt seeing this show was fear , both for myself and for what has become of us as a society , '' said Claudio Sanchez , 30 , an art teacher who was visiting the show one Saturday morning in July with two pupils .
`` The more I saw , the more frightened I became . ''
