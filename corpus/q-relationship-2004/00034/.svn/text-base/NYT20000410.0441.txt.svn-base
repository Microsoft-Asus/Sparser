The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , April 11 : The unexpected announcement on Monday that the leaders of North and South Korea plan to meet in June could lead to a lessening of tensions on the Cold War 's last military frontier .
The talks between South Korea 's president , Kim Dae -jung , and Kim Jong -il , the North Korean leader , would be the first discussion between the leaders of the two Koreas since the peninsula was divided after World War II .
It is nearly 50 years since an armistice ended the Korean War .
But a peace agreement has yet to be signed .
Each side has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops on either side of a demilitarized zone filled with tank barriers and minefields .
Some 37,000 American troops remain permanently based in South Korea to bolster Seoul 's defenses should the North again attack .
Meanwhile , North Korea 's flirtation with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles compounds the dangers and the risk of renewed American military involvement .
Although the North 's main motive in seeking this meeting seems to be its desire to take up Seoul 's offers of humanitarian relief and economic assistance , the South is sure to bring up security issues as well .
For years , North Korea tried to reach around South Korean leaders to strike a deal with the United States .
Washington has wisely insisted that direct dialogue between North and South Korea must come first .
Since Kim Dae -jung was elected South Korea 's president in 1997 , he has courted new business , tourist and humanitarian ties with the North .
His `` sunshine policy '' has tried to couple continued military vigilance with new openings aimed at encouraging more predictable , less dangerous relations across the 38th Parallel .
The announcement of the June meetings , to take place in the North Korean capital , Pyongyang , confirms the wisdom of Seoul 's approach .
It does so at a particularly helpful time for Kim , just three days before important congressional elections that will determine how much political authority he commands during the remaining three years of his term .
The North 's agreement to these meetings seems to demonstrate that Kim il is now firmly in charge of North Korea and inclined to reach out diplomatically to the wider world .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In recent weeks the once reclusive North has sought improved ties not just with Seoul but with various European countries , China , Japan and the United States .</ENAMEX>
Though political developments inside North Korea remain largely opaque , this spurt of diplomatic activity must be considered encouraging .
North Korea is still dangerous and unpredictable .
Its economy barely functions and there are fears that it could abruptly collapse , sending millions of refugees fleeing south and perhaps sparking clashes across the DMZ .
Seoul should approach this meeting carefully .
Previous efforts to bring together the top Northern and Southern leaders have fallen through .
If the June meetings proceed as planned , however , they could start a belated but hopeful thaw in relations between the two Koreas .
