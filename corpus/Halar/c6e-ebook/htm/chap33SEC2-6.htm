However, molecular data place the lophophorates squarely in the protostome branch. These phyla are collectively called the <span class="Emphasis2">lophophorate animals</span> after the most distinctive structure they share, the lophophore (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.14</span>). The <span class="Emphasis2">lophophore</span> is a horseshoe-shaped or circular fold of the body wall bearing ciliated tentacles that surround the mouth (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.11</span>). The anus lies outside the whorl of tentacles. The cilia draw water toward the mouth between the tentacles, which help trap food particles for these suspension-feeders. The common occurrence of this complex apparatus in the lophophorate animals suggests that the three phyla are related. Other similarities, such as a U-shaped digestive tract and the absence of a distinct head, are adaptations to a sessile existence. In contrast to flatworms, which lack body cavities, and rotifers, which have pseudocoeloms, lophophorates have true coeloms completely lined by mesoderm (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.6c</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-14','../fig/big/fig33-14.jpg','fig33-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-14.jpg" alt="fig33-14" name="myfig33-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The lophophorate animals.</span> The most distinctive characteristic of these phyla is the lophophore, an organ that functions in suspension-feeding. <span class="Emphasis2">(a)</span> Bryozoans, such as this common sea mat <span class="Emphasis1">(Membranipora membranacea)</span>, are colonial lophophorates, many with hard exoskeletons. <span class="Emphasis2">(b)</span> Brachiopods are lophophorates with a hinged shell.

In most species, the colony is encased in a hard exoskeleton with pores through which the lophophores of the animals extend (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.14a</span>).

A brachiopod lives attached to its substratum by a stalk, opening its shell slightly to allow water to flow between the shells and the lophophore. All brachiopods are marine. The living brachiopods are remnants of a much richer past; only about 330 extant species are known, but there are 30,000 species of Paleozoic and Mesozoic fossils.
