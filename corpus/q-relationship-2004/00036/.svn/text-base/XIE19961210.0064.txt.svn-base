BEIJING , December 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang today urged the ongoing Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- in Singapore to play a positive role in the talks on China 's entry into the organization .
He noted that some Western countries consider that there are still difficulties and obstacles for China to enter the WTO , which has been noticed by China .
However , Shen said , according to the Chinese government , it has every qualification to enter the organization .
At present , the main obstacle to China 's bid is political considerations , with some Western nations putting excessive demands on China , he said .
`` This is not conducive to the future development of the WTO , nor to bilateral trade and economic ties , '' the spokesman noted .
