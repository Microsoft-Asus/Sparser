WASHINGTON , September 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday confirmed reports the Federal Bureau of Investigation is planning to shift a number of its agents into counter-terrorism operations .
But Reno said that there is no firm number of agents to be transferred , that the administration is asking Congress for 108 new agents to fight terrorism and that President Bill Clinton will be making an announcement once the overall plans are firm .
The Washington Post Thursday quoted `` senior federal law enforcement officials '' as saying that at least 500 agents would be reassigned to contend with the heightened threat of domestic and international terrorism .
In a speech after a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia killed 19 U.S. service members in June , Clinton said `` the war against terrorism '' had replaced the Cold War .
Since then , the FBI has been called in to investigate the crash of TWA Flight 800 , which killed all 230 people aboard on July 17 , and the pipe bomb explosion in Atlanta 's Olympic Centennial Park which caused the death of two people on July 27 .
Reno said Thursday the reassignments should not hurt other areas of FBI operations , such as violent crime and white-collar crime .
