COLOMBO , January 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Sri Lankan shippers have been hit by a 100-percent hike in war risk insurance levy on all exports and imports , official sources said today .
The revision in surcharge rates was prompted by an evaluation made by the War Risk Committee in London .
This followed warnings given by the Sri Lanka navy that ships plying in the Indian Ocean were at risk of terrorist attacks .
While private insurance companies have already effected the increase , the two government-owned insurance corporations -- the National Insurance Corporation and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation -- have not yet increased their premiums .
