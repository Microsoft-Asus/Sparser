WASHINGTON --
Delivering an emphatic message along with a blunt election-year threat , hundreds of thousands of mothers and other gun-control advocates rallied Sunday in the name of protecting children and to prod Congress to pass stricter gun control laws .
`` You are the future .
You are the ones who are going to make our lawmakers listen , '' Sarah Brady , chairwoman of Handgun Control , Inc. , told participants in the Million Mom March on the National Mall .
`` We must either change the minds of these lawmakers , or for God 's sake , in November , let 's change the lawmakers , '' said Brady .
Her husband , James , was Ronald Reagan 's press secretary when he was shot and seriously wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on the president 's life .
Organizers and participants saw Sunday 's event as an important step toward achieving their policy goals , which include licensing all gun owners , requiring trigger locks for handguns , and mandatory safety training .
They also want to change public attitudes about the way guns are sold and regulated .
By the end of the day Sunday , they were claiming success for the march .
Organizers of the event estimated more than 500,000 people took part .
There was no crowd estimate from the National Park Service .
About 300 people from Washington attended , state organizers said .
`` This has gone way beyond my expectations , '' said Melissa Chasan , 40 , of Mercer Island , who helped organize Washington state 's effort .
`` This has been amazing , '' she said , gazing over the immense crowd .
Similar rallies were scheduled in nearly 70 cities across the country .
In Olympia , Wash. , hundreds of women staged opposing Mother 's Day rallies Sunday , one group calling for an end to gun violence and one demanding that the right to keep and bear arms be protected .
The gun-control advocates did n't have the day to themselves .
Several thousand counter-demonstrators , organized by a group called Second Amendment Sisters , Inc. , gathered near the Washington Monument to argue that guns were needed for self-protection .
President Clinton and many Democrats have seized on gun control as a seminal issue in the fall election and they used the march as a way to expose their differences with Republicans .
`` Do n't be deterred by the intimidation , do n't be deterred by the screaming , do n't be deterred by the political mountain you have to climb .
You just remember this : There are more people who think like you in America , '' Clinton told the crowd in comments broadcast from the White House .
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the march .
Clinton , like many Democrats and the organizers of Sunday 's march at the Mall , backs legislation that would close a loophole allowing guns to be sold at gun shows without a full background check .
He supports rules that would require child safety locks to be provided with every handgun sold ; ban high-capacity ammunition clips ; bar the most violent juveniles from possessing firearms as adults ; and hold adults accountable if they allow children access to guns .
The National Rifle Association has countered with a pledge to spend an additional $ 1 million of its money on gun safety education in elementary schools , a proposal that organizers of the Million Mom March derided .
Supporters of the march say such efforts divert attention from core questions and allow opponents to claim that the goal is to keep guns away from law-abiding citizens .
That is not the case , supporters of the march said .
`` There are two kinds of people we need to keep from guns from -- criminals and children , '' said Rep. Jay Inslee , D - Wash. , who was one of the few members of Congress to attend the march here .
And despite failures by gun-control advocates to move tougher legislation through Congress , Inslee said the tide might be turning .
`` I believe this is the start of a larger movement that will result in common-sense laws , I really do , '' he said .
`` This issue has been so stuck on ideology for so long , but we 're hearing moms saying do n't get stuck on ideology , do what 's right . ''
`` This is the birth of our baby and we still intend to raise the child .
We are not going away , '' said Josie Powers , 28 , who helped organize a Saturday rally in Seattle and then flew to Washington for the main event .
The Million Mom March underscored the deep divide caused by gun control proposals .
The counter demonstration only blocks away drew women advocating gun rights .
`` The legally carrying people are the safe folks .
It 's the bad guys .
Why are n't we concentrating on the bad guys and leave decent , law-abiding people alone to defend themselves and their families ? ''
Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia Hupp said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
Hupp , whose parents were among those killed by a gunman in a Texas cafeteria in October 1991 , was a keynote speaker at the Second Amendment Sisters rally .
`` Registration and licensing is nothing but a controlled burn of the Second Amendment , '' Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the NRA , said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation . ''
`` That 's not the answer .
You do n't want to set aside or set on fire our freedoms .
What you want to do is you want to enforce the laws against the bad guys we already have . ''
Conceived by a New Jersey mother last year , the Million Mom March featured an array of celebrities from talk show host Rosie O'Donnell to singer Raffi to actress Susan Sarandon .
Women from Washington state marched behind an eight-foot banner that said , `` Congress , stop taking bribes from the NRA , '' a reference to the political contributions made by the group .
Many in attendance were motivated by tragedy .
`` The gun that killed my daughter in her classroom was one that could be loaded by a 6-year -old , carried by a 6-year -old , and fired by a 6-year -old , '' said Veronica McQueen , whose daughter , Kayla Rolland , was shot and killed by her classmate in her first grade classroom in Flint , Mich. , last Feb. 29 .
