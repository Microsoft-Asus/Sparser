TUNIS , August 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Terming the U.N. embargo against Libya as `` unacceptable and unjustifiable , '' Tunisia said Tuesday it will stand by Libya in confronting the sanctions .
Hamed Karoui , prime minister of Tunisia , made the remarks upon his arrival in Tripoli , capital of Libya , the Tunisia Africa News Agency reported .
But the news agency did not say if Karoui went there by air to break the U.N. imposed air embargo on Libya .
The U.N. imposed the air and arms embargo on 1992 after Libya refused to hand over two Libyans , suspected of bombing a Pan - Am airliner over Lockerbie , Scotland , in 1988 , for trial in the U.S. or Britain .
Libya has insisted the trial be held in a neutral country to ensure its justice .
Three African leaders have defied the embargo by flying to Libya last month .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">And the Organization of African Unity also made a call in June for its members to ignore the sanctions as of September 1 if the U.S. and Britain made no compromise</ENAMEX> .
Karoui , leading a high-level delegation on a two-day working visit , is going to hold talks with his Libyan counterpart Mohamed al- Mangoush on ways to enhance bilateral cooperation .
Karoui said the talks will serve as `` another brick in the palace of the fruitful cooperation and constructive integration between the two countries in the face of regional and international challenges . ''
