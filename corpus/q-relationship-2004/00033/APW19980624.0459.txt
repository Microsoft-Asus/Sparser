-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A protest boat from Hong Kong twice entered waters claimed by Japan around a group of disputed islands Wednesday and its occupants then abandoned ship , reporting a leak , Japan 's coast guard said .
The drifting , unmanned 100-ton trawler was one of four protest ships from Taiwan and Hong Kong staying just outside Japanese waters as of 8 p.m .
-LRB- 1100 GMT -RRB- , said a coast guard official .
Two others were heading back to Taiwan , he added .
All but one of the 25 activists and crew members from the trawler Diaoyutai went aboard other ships from Taiwan , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
A Japanese patrol boat picked up the remaining one , and the coast guard was consulting with immigration officials about how to return him home , the official said .
The six protest ships were making the latest in a series of efforts to land on the uninhabited , Japanese -controlled islands to dramatize claims to them by China and Taiwan .
Protesters hoped to plant a Chinese flag on one of the islands , expedition leader Albert Ho has said .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">` We are prepared to respond appropriately to any illegal entry , '' said Akira Suzuki , spokesman of the Okinawa regional headquarters of the coast guard , known as the Maritime Safety Agency .</ENAMEX>
The official who reported the latest activity said the agency did not know how many protesters were aboard the protest ships .
He also declined to say how many Japanese patrol boats were keeping watch around the islands , about 220 kilometers -LRB- 136 miles -RRB- northeast of Taipei in the East China Sea .
Kyodo News agency said about 50 were in the area .
The official said the Diaoyutai entered Japanese territorial waters for periods of 17 minutes and slightly more than an hour , with Japanese patrols asking it to leave each time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The islands are known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese .
Two years ago , a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels kept him from landing on the islands .</ENAMEX>
On a later protest expedition , several activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the islands .
Also , in May 1997 , the coast guard prevented Japanese right-wing activists from reaching one of the islands , where they have built two lighthouses .
One of the lighthouses later was reportedly knocked down by a storm .
