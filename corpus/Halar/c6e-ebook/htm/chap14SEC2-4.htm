A basic understanding of these rules of chance is essential for genetic analysis.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The probability scale ranges from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1, while an event that is certain <span class="Emphasis1">not</span> to occur has a probability of 0. With a two-headed coin, the probability of tossing heads is 1, and the probability of tossing tails is 0. With a normal coin, the chance of tossing heads is 1/2, and the chance of tossing tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling the number 3 with a die, which is six-sided, is 1/6. The probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event must add up to 1. With a die, the chance of rolling a number other than 3 is 5/6.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">We can learn an important lesson about probability from tossing a coin. For every toss, the probability of heads is 1/2. The outcome of any particular toss is unaffected by what has happened on previous trials. We refer to phenomena such as successive coin tosses, or simultaneous tosses of several coins, as independent events. The question of whether a tossed coin will come up heads or tails is analogous to the question of whether a gamete produced by a <span class="Emphasis1">Pp</span> heterozygote will carry allele <span class="Emphasis1">P</span> or allele <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.8</span>). In every fertilization involving such gametes, the ovum has a 1/2 chance of carrying the dominant allele and a 1/2 chance of carrying the recessive allele. The same odds apply to the sperm cell. Like two separate coin tosses, allele segregation during formation of the sperm and ovum occurs as two independent events.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig14-8','../fig/big/fig14-8.jpg','fig14-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig14-8.jpg" alt="fig14-8" name="myfig14-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 14-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Segregation of alleles and fertilization as chance events.</span> When a heterozygote (<span class="Emphasis1">Pp</span>) forms gametes, segregation of alleles is like the toss of a coin.

Two basic laws of probability that can help us in games of chance and in solving genetic problems are the rule of multiplication and the rule of addition.</p><p class="Header3">The Rule of Multiplication</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">What is the chance that two coins tossed simultaneously will land heads up? More generally, how do we determine the chance that two or more independent events will occur together in some specific combination? The solution is in computing the probability for each independent event, then multiplying these individual probabilities to obtain the overall probability of these events occurring together. By this rule of multiplication, the probability that both coins will land heads up is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4. An F<SUB>1</SUB> monohybrid cross is analogous to this game of chance. With flower color in pea plants as the heritable character, the genotype of a given F<SUB>1</SUB> plant is <span class="Emphasis1">Pp.</span> What is the probability that a particular F<SUB>2</SUB> plant will have white flowers? For this to happen, both the ovum and the sperm must carry the <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> allele, so we invoke the rule of multiplication. Segregation in the heterozygous plant is like flipping a coin. The probability that an ovum will have the <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> allele is 1/2. The chance that a sperm will have the <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> allele is 1/2. Thus, the probability that two <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> alleles will come together at fertilization is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4, equivalent to the probability that two independently tossed coins will land heads up (see the Punnett square in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.8</span>).</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">We can also apply the rule of multiplication to dihybrid crosses, such as the one shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7b</span>. For a parent with the genotype <span class="Emphasis1">YyRr,</span> the probability that a gamete will carry the <span class="Emphasis1">Y</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> alleles is 1/4. We can use the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of specific genotypes in the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation without having to construct a 16-part Punnett square. For example, the probability of an F<SUB>2</SUB> plant having the genotype <span class="Emphasis1">YYRR</span> is 1/16 (1/4 chance for a <span class="Emphasis1">YR</span> ovum &#160;X&#160; 1/4 chance for a <span class="Emphasis1">YR</span> sperm). This corresponds to the top box in the Punnett square of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.7b</span>.</p><p class="Header3">The Rule of Addition</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">What is the probability that an F<SUB>2</SUB> plant from a monohybrid cross will be heterozygous? Notice in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.8</span> that there are two ways F<SUB>1</SUB> gametes can combine to produce a heterozygous result. The dominant allele can come from the ovum and the recessive allele from the sperm, or vice versa. By the rule of addition, the probability of an event that can occur in two or more different ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of those ways. Using this rule, we can calculate the probability of an F<SUB>2</SUB> heterozygote as 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.</p><p class="Header3">Using Rules of Probability to Solve Genetics Problems</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">We can combine the rules of multiplication and addition to solve complex problems in Mendelian genetics. For instance, imagine a cross of two pea varieties that differ in three characters--a <span class="Emphasis1">trihybrid</span> cross. Suppose we cross a trihybrid with purple flowers and yellow, round seeds (heterozygous for all three genes) with a plant with purple flowers and green, wrinkled seeds (heterozygous for flower color but homozygous recessive for the other two characters). Using Mendelian symbols, our cross is

We can start by listing all genotypes that fulfill this condition: <span class="Emphasis1">ppyyRr, ppYyrr, Ppyyrr, PPyyrr,</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">ppyyrr.</span> (Because the condition is <span class="Emphasis1">at least two</span> recessive traits, this last genotype, which produces all three recessive phenotypes, counts.) Next, we use the rule of multiplication to calculate the probability for each of these genotypes from our <span class="Emphasis1">PpYyRr</span>&#160;X&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">Ppyyrr</span> cross (that is, we multiply the individual probabilities for the allele pairs). Finally, we use the rule of addition to pool the probabilities for fulfilling the condition of at least two recessive traits as shown at the top of the next column.</p><TABLE BORDER="0"><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="5"><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"><span class="Emphasis1">ppyyRr</span></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">&#188; (probability of <span class="Emphasis1">PP</span>) &#160;X&#160;&#189; (<span class="Emphasis1">yy</span>) &#160;X&#160; (<span class="Emphasis1">Rr</span>)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 1/16</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"><span class="Emphasis1">ppYyrr</span></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 1/16</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"><span class="Emphasis1">Ppyyrr</span></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 2/16</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"><span class="Emphasis1">PPyyrr</span></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 1/16</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="2" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText"><span class="Emphasis1">ppyyrr</span></P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 1/16 Chance of <span class="Emphasis1">at least two</span> recessive traits</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">= 6/16 or 3/8</P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="para26"></a><p class="BlockText">With practice, you’ll be able to apply the rules of probability to solve genetics problems faster than you could by filling in Punnett squares.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
