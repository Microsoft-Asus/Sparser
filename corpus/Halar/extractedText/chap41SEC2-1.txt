 Animals are heterotrophs that require food for fuel, carbon skeletons, and essential nutrients:an overview

A nutritionally adequate diet satisfies three needs: fuel (chemical energy) for all the cellular work of the body; the organic raw materials animals use in biosynthesis (carbon skeletons to make many of their own molecules); and essential nutrients, substances that the animal cannot make for itself from any raw material and therefore must obtain in food in prefabricated form.
