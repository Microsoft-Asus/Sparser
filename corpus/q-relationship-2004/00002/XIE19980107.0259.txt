WASHINGTON , January 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- NASA 's unmanned spacecraft Lunar Prospector was successfully sent into space Tuesday night at Cape Canaveral Space Center .
The 660-pound cylindrical Lunar Prospector , the first Moon mission by NASA in 25 years , will enter into Lunar 's orbit after about four and half days ' journey and begin its complete and detailed survey of the Moon .
With five scientific instruments on board , the spacecraft will gather data on the Moon 's structure , composition and potentially useful resources for future interplanetary exploration .
But one of its major objects is to look for the evidence that weather there is liquid water on the Moon .
Humans last visited the Moon in December 1972 .
Future pioneers could separate water , if it 's there , into hydrogen and oxygen and thus make their own rocket fuel .
After 18-month 's probe , the Lunar Prospector will crash-land on the Moon .
