SEOUL , South Korea --
In the two months since it agreed to freeze its long-range missile tests in exchange for the United States lifting economic sanctions , North Korea has been swamped with inquiries from foreign companies , investors and trade groups seeking to do business there .
With a population of 24 million , a low-cost , well-trained work force and close proximity to two important Asian economies , South Korea and Japan , North Korea has its attractions as a site for foreign investment .
Though the inquiries have led to several highly publicized trade missions to North Korea , few , if any , foreign firms are expected to actually set up shop there any time soon , because of one obstacle that has not changed : the hermetic country 's Stalinist political climate .
Government officials , consultants and people who have done business with North Korea said that unless the reclusive regime of Kim Jong Il simplifies the investment process and makes its dealings more open and businesslike , substantial new foreign investment and trade are unlikely .
`` A lot of investors will come to Pyongyang on a trade mission and take one look at the way North Korea operates , and they will never come back , '' said Anthony Michell , president of Euro - Asian Business Consultancy Ltd. , which advises companies with an eye on northeast Asia .
Michell said that North Korea might be an attractive place to manufacture goods for export to the United States , now that such trade will be legal , but that foreign companies will have to endure a long , convoluted and frustrating negotiation process to get established .
`` The biggest turnoff is dealing with an old-style Communist system in which people do n't understand the ways of the world , '' said Michael Breen , a public relations consultant who has advised companies seeking a foothold in North Korea .
`` It 's a very bureaucratic place , and party politics rule , '' Breen said .
`` It 's easy to be misunderstood , and most people who are friendly and supportive of the regime eventually run afoul and get thrown out . ''
He recalled the case of a Belgian entrepreneur who set up a diamond-cutting business in North Korea that employed several hundred people .
The business thrived for a while , and the government often showed off the factory to foreign trade delegations .
Then the entrepreneur was forced to leave the country without explanation .
`` North Korea does n't see you as an individual , but as part of the agenda of your country , '' Breen said .
`` Something happens at a high level with your country 's government that they do n't like , and the North Koreans take it out on you . ''
Still , investors remain interested .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A few pioneers , mainly South Korean conglomerates like Hyundai , Samsung and Daewoo , have already made major investments in tourism and manufacturing in North Korea .</ENAMEX>
And the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul plans to take a delegation of 10 United States business executives -- chosen from more than 90 applicants -- on a trade mission to North Korea as early as next month .
Obviously , nobody who does business in North Korea is going to make a lot of money right out of the starting blocks , '' said Jeff Jones , president of the chamber .
`` It 's a beginning , and everybody knows that it will be slow and difficult .
But over time we believe that North Korea will learn how to deal with U.S. businesses . ''
Members of the delegation will be seeking assurances from North Korea on remittances , ownership rights and security issues , the chamber said , and will want to see if distribution and transportation facilities , regulatory systems and labor will be adequate .
Jones said the initial business activities in North Korea are likely to be in areas like infrastructure development , finance , agriculture and telecommunications .
For example , Motorola , the mobile telephone company , will join the delegation .
Much of North Korea has not been wired for basic telephone service , and it may be faster and more economical for the country to install a national cellular system instead .
The Clinton administration agreed to relax sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act , dating from the Korean War in the 1950s , after North Korea pledged to stop development of a long-range missile that threatened to upset the balance of power in Asia .
The country 's erratic behavior has long scared off investors ; in the last year it has provoked a naval skirmish with the south over fishing rights and held a tourist captive on charges of being rude .
`` What 's most important to attract investors is the improvement of North - South relations and a reduction of military tensions between the two , '' said Myoung Gyon Chu , an official at South Korea 's Unification Ministry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">If large-scale foreign investment comes to North Korea , most analysts expect it to be on the coattails of the South Korean companies already making headway there .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The biggest investor by far is Hyundai Group</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A year ago , in the biggest inter- Korean joint venture since the country was partitioned in 1945 , Hyundai began running sightseeing cruise tours of Diamond Mountain , a scenic attraction on North Korea 's east coast .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Since 1996 , the Daewoo Group has operated a 1,300-employee joint venture in the north to manufacture shirts , jackets and bags for sale in Europe , Latin America and Japan , including items under the Pierre Cardin label .</ENAMEX>
It exports about $ 25 million of apparel a year .
Ki Hwan -moon , general manager of Daewoo , said it took $ 5 million and four years of negotiations with North Korea to get the company up and running .
`` We decided to do it because there was a new market opportunity , the production costs were lower and the workers speak the same language , '' he said .
`` Part of the investment is to promote good will and improve relations between the two countries . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But even major South Korean companies like Hyundai , which has long been a champion of investing in North Korea , sometimes find it difficult to deal with Pyongyang </ENAMEX>.
Hyundai reached an agreement on Oct. 1 to build a new industrial complex to make a variety of consumer products , but a follow-up delegation twice had to postpone a visit to the country because of a difference over where to build it : the company favors Haeju , a western port city less than 100 miles from Seoul , while the government prefers Sinuiju , far to the north near the Chinese border .
The delegation finally began its trip last Monday .
Other companies are closely watching Hyundai 's experience in North Korea .
Ghil Joon Choi , director of North Korean business projects for Samsung Group , said that he expects similar delays in obtaining approval to build a large consumer electronics factory and set up a fish-importing business there .
`` There has been no real progress since our last trip to North Korea , '' around the time of the June naval skirmish , he said .
Asked why foreign companies should consider North Korea worth the frustrations and risks , Jones , the chamber president , argued that economic integration would help stabilize the country , whose 24 million people will one day offer a lucrative market opportunity , just as South Korea did a generation ago .
`` If it does n't work out , then I guess we will lose a few bucks , but given how hard-working and bright the Koreans are , I suppose it will work , '' he said .
