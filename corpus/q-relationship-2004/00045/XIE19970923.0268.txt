ROME , September 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A Rome court trial of former Christian Democrat Minister Calogero Mannino shed more light today on the strong links between the Sicilian Mafia and Italian politicians in 1970s and 1980s .
Gioacchino Pennino , an ex- Mafia affiliate , told the court that the Mafia `` inspired and conditioned '' many of the political candidates of those years in Palermo , capital of Sicily .
Without Mafia support , it was impossible to enter and perform the public service , Pennino claimed .
Pennino , a well-known Palermo doctor , named a number of former Christian Democrats who had `` close '' relations with the Mafia .
The Mafia has a tradition to turn to political parties , he said .
He said , `` first the Monarchists , then the Liberals , the the Christian Democrats and finally the Socialists , for whom the Cosa Nostra bosses gave an order to vote en masses in the 1987 general election . ''
Pennino said that he used to frequented Christian Democrat circles but never agreed to run for political office .
`` I did n't want to make it even easier for the Mafia to blackmail me , '' he claimed .
He said that he had no knowledge on whether Salvo Lima , a powerful Christian Democrat and the leader of former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti 's faction in Sicily , was a Mafia -linked member of parliament .
Lima , who was killed by the Mafia in 1992 , has been alleged as the main link between Andreotti and the Mafia bosses .
Andreotti , a life senator and the seven-times premier denies all charges against him , saying they are part of a Mafia plot to revenge him for crackdowns on organized crime by governments he headed .
Andreotti 's trial began in 1994 .
