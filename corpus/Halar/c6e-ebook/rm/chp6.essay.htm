									<a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">A recent revival of the anti-evolutionary "argument from design" holds that biochemical pathways are too complex to have evolved, because all intermediate steps in a given pathway must be present to produce the final product. Critique this argument. How could you use the existing diversity of metabolic pathways that produce the same or similar products to support your case?</p>

									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">A researcher has developed an assay to measure the activity of an important liver enzyme present in liver cells which are being cultured in a lab. She adds the substrate for the enzymatic reaction to the dish of cells, then measures the appearance of the reaction products. The results are graphed as the amount of product on the <span class="Emphasis1">y</span> axis versus time on the <span class="Emphasis1">x</span> axis. The researcher noted four sections of the graph. For a short period of time, no products appeared (section A). In section B, the reaction rate was quite rapid (the slope of the line was steep). After some time, the reaction slowed down considerably (section C), although products continued to appear (the line was not flat). Still later, the reaction resumed its original rapid rate (section D). Draw the graph, and propose a model to explain the molecular events underlying this interesting reaction profile.</p>

									<a name="para93"></a><p class="BlockText">As mandated by the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act, the EPA has announced its intention to evaluate the safety of the most commonly used organophosphate insecticides (organic compounds containing phosphate groups). In agriculture, the most frequently used organophosphates account for half of the 58 million pounds applied annually nationwide. Organophosphates typically interfere with nerve transmission by inhibiting the enzymes that degrade the transmitter molecules that diffuse from one neuron to another. Noxious insects are not uniquely susceptible; humans and other vertebrates can be affected as well. Thus, the use of organophosphate pesticides creates some health risks. As a consumer, what levels of risk are you willing to accept in exchange for an abundant and affordable food supply? Is it prudent to expect "a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from pesticide exposure" ? What other facts would you like to know about this situation before you defend your opinion?</p>
