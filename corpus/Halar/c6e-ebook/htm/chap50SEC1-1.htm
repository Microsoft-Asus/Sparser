As hunters and gatherers, prehistoric people had to learn where game and edible plants could be found in greatest abundance. Naturalists, from Aristotle to Darwin, made the process of observing and describing organisms in their natural habitats an end in itself, rather than simply a means of survival. Because extraordinary insight can still be gained through this descriptive approach of discovery science (see Chapter 1), natural history remains a fundamental part of ecology.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Although ecology has a long history as a descriptive science, it is becoming increasingly experimental. In spite of the difficulty of conducting field experiments over large areas and over many years, many ecologists are testing hypotheses in the field. For example, in 1993, oceanographers added dissolved iron to a 64-km<SUP>2</SUP> area of open ocean in the equatorial Pacific to test on a large scale the hypothesis that a shortage of iron as an inorganic nutrient was limiting production in this ecosystem. The experiment was repeated in 1995 on an even larger scale with similar results--greatly increased phytoplankton growth when the iron was added. These kinds of field experiments make ecology a rapidly growing and exciting science.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
