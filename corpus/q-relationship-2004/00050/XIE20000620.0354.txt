ROME , June 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Italian Finance Police operating in the lower Adriatic port city of Bari Tuesday seized 191 kilograms of uncut cocaine with a street value of nearly 60 billion lire -LRB- about 29.6 million U.S. dollars -RRB- shipped to Italy by the Colombian Cali ' cartel .
Police reported that the cocaine was transported in cavities carved into rough blocks of granite , which were then sealed with plaster and painted to restore the original appearance of the granite .
The drugs , they said , could not be detected by a visual inspection of the granite or by sniffer dogs .
At the conclusion of an operation which included the lengthy surveillance of suspects and sites , it was learned that the Cali ' cartel shipped the cocaine via a stone-working company named Italagreco , in Sante Fe de Bogota , to another marble-working company in Andria , near Bari .
The blocks were taken off a freighter and hauled by truck to the Comar marble-working operation in Andria , owned by Giuseppe Cicco , with Cicco 's sister , Filomena , in charge of transport .
The cocaine was then removed from the granite blocks and packed into steel-reinforced concrete piers for storage .
In their search of a villa owned by Filomena Cicco , police came across lire valued at nearly 600,000 dollars , Dutch guilders and German marks .
Cicco was said to have the job only of storing the cocaine , the sale of which was in the hands of two Colombian Cali ' cartel emissaries identified as Leonardo Esquivel and Silvio Gomez Herrera .
Thus , said police , the drugs remained the property of the cartel until sale in smaller quantities and there was no direct relationship between buyers and sellers .
The lot of cocaine seized Tuesday had been ordered by a man identified as Gennaro Bonifacio , 32 , from Naples but with residence near Milan , indicating that the drugs were all bound for markets in the Lombardy region .
