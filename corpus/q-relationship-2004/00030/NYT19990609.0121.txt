WASHINGTON --
They were mysteriously appointed , they meet behind closed doors and they have questionable public accountability .
Yet members of the interim board of the Internet 's new oversight body are beginning to make decisions and shape policy that could ultimately affect everyone who uses the global network .
To finance the $ 5.9 million annual budget of the oversight body , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , or Icann , this temporary board has voted to levy a $ 1 a year tax on the more than four million Internet addresses , or domain names , that end in .com , .net and .org .
The board is also planning to impose tens of thousands of dollars in licensing and other fees on companies that want to get into the business of dispensing Internet addresses .
Recently , the board endorsed controversial recommendations for establishing a new global framework for resolving disputes over who can and cannot use certain words in their Internet addresses .
Esther Dyson , the chairwoman of the interim board , which was set up last year , says the group is carrying out its government-mandated charge to break up the current monopoly in Internet name registration and to move Internet governance to the private sector .
But critics say the board is overstepping its authority and ignoring another mandate -- to create a transparent , bottoms-up organization .
Instead , they say , the board is working behind the scenes with powerful international corporate and government interests to create a top-down hierarchy that flies in the face of the free-wheeling , consensus -based spirit that built the Internet .
Such sentiments are but the latest chapter in yearslong sniping fueled by international jealousies and myriad conspiracy theories .
What is different now , some observers say , is that the Internet , which is built on a cooperative technology for routing data around the globe is in less stable hands -- increasing the risk that angry factions will in effect secede from the network , damaging its integrity by splitting it into several smaller , disconnected networks .
Although such a split is considered unlikely , anxiety over who is running the show could curb investments in the rapidly growing electronic commerce industry .
`` The risks are that Icann has a little bit of authority but very little legitimacy , '' said Bill Whyman , an Internet analyst for the Legg Mason investment company in Washington .
`` This is an awkward consensus-building process .
If it pushes too far and causes itself to lose support among key constituencies , Icann itself can be undercut .
Then you have a very bad situation with no one in control .
Then you have a very bad situation for e-commerce . ''
Icann was created last year by one of the Internet 's founding fathers , Jon Postel , as the Clinton administration moved to complete the privatization of the Internet .
The U.S. government , which financed the creation of the Internet over several decades , had begun privatizing the network in 1995 by turning over responsibility for domain name registration -- that is , the assigning of Internet addresses -- to a Virginia -based company , Network Solutions Inc .
But as Network Solutions ' lucrative government-sanctioned monopoly became increasingly controversial , the administration made it a top priority to introduce competition into the registration business -- while also transferring oversight of the Internet to a private international body .
While a Commerce Department report last June mapped out the principles and goals for such a body , however , there were very few specifics spelled out .
Icann was set up as a nonprofit organization by Postel , a computer scientist at the University of Southern California who for years administered the address numbering system behind Internet domain names .
But he died unexpectedly shortly after the interim board was named last fall , turning unanswered questions about how he selected the members into something of an Internet mystery .
Whatever its origins , the interim board now has nine members -- plus the corporation 's temporary president , Michael Rogers .
In addition to Ms. Dyson , a well-known Internet analyst , publisher and entrepreneur , the board includes telecommunications executives and academics from the United States , Europe , Asia , Australia and Latin America .
Though the interim board had been expected to set up the procedures for building up a broad -based Icann membership that might elect a full-time board , the interim group has itself become a policy-making body .
Some critics say Icann pushed too far last month in Berlin , when it endorsed in principle recommendations of a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization for cracking down on cybersquatters , the speculators who register and then try to resell popular domain names , and for resolving disputes over who has the right to trademarks registered as Internet addresses .
The board referred the report to Icann 's domain name committee , which is to recommend ways to meet the goals .
But to many , the deck seems stacked in favor of big corporations and trademark holders since a key part of that committee -- members representing noncommercial name holders -- has not yet been appointed by the board .
Icann has yet to appoint the at-large members who will elect half of the permanent board .
Until a board is elected , Icann is largely responsible only to the Commerce Department , which endorsed its creation and is pushing for quick establishment of dispute-resolution mechanisms so that Icann can set up full-scale competition in the registration business .
`` There is a lot of pressure to introduce competition , '' said A. Michael Froomkin , a University of Miami law professor who was on the panel of experts that advised the World Intellectual Property Organization , an arm of the United Nations , in its drafting of the report .
In response to that pressure , Froomkin says , voicing a common criticism , Icann is `` going fast on the decision making instead of going faster on doing the setting up '' of an elected board .
Ms. Dyson , however , says Icann is caught between special interest groups : noisy critics crying for the board to slow down and quieter interests with a large stake in the process , who are insisting that the board move faster , particularly to resolve disputes over domain names and trademarks .
`` It 's frustrating to hear ` Let 's go slow ; let 's go fast , ' '' she said .
`` I just want to hear legitimate criticism of what we may or may not do .
Let 's argue it on the merits . ''
