WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The White House agreed Thursday to allow U.S. companies to sell the most powerful data-scrambling technology overseas with virtually no restrictions , a concession to America 's high-tech industry over law enforcement and national security objections .
The move was a defeat for the Justice Department , which had forcefully argued that criminals and terrorists might use the technology to scramble messages about crimes or deadly plots .
Even as the new policy was announced , Attorney General Janet Reno said at the White House , `` In stopping a terrorist attack or seeking to recover a kidnapped child , encountering encryption might mean the difference between success and catastrophic failure . ''
She said the policy `` will mean that more terrorists and criminals will use encryption . ''
To help law enforcement , the White House will urge Congress to give the FBI $ 80 million over four years to develop techniques to break messages scrambled by terrorists .
The decision should help U.S. companies in overseas competition -- and help consumers worldwide guarantee the privacy of their e-mail and online credit-card purchases .
Although Reno described dire consequences of criminals using encryption , she readily acknowledged the technology `` is critically important for protecting our privacy and our security , and the administration . ''
The White House 's announcement comes as Vice President Al Gore , a self-described technology buff , courts the favor of the booming high-tech industry during his presidential campaign .
`` This decision by the vice president , who was really leading this effort , now is consistent with the views of virtually everyone in the technology community , '' said Robert Holleyman , executive director of the Business Software Alliance .
Critics of restrictions on export sales said criminals and terrorists already could buy or download powerful encryption technology made in other countries .
`` Those who are going to misuse encryption for criminal purchases are n't going to limit themselves to U.S. -made encryption products , '' said Ed Gillespie , executive director of Americans for Computer Privacy .
The administration will allow high-tech companies to sell even the most powerful encryption technology overseas to private and commercial customers after a one-time technical review of their products .
`` A company -LRB- wanting approval -RRB- will need to come in with more than a brochure , '' Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said .
Reno said `` I 'm obviously not going to tell you '' whether the FBI already can decode messages scrambled using the newly permitted encryption strengths .
`` We are going to have a very significant research and development program in the months ahead of us , '' Hamre said .
`` This is a complex environment , it 's going to change every day and it 's going to take us a fair amount of effort to stay ahead of the problem . ''
The White House will still require companies to seek permission to sell the scrambling technology to a foreign government or military -- a condition Hamre said the Defense Department insisted upon -- and it maintains bans on selling to seven nations accused of terrorism : Iran , Iraq , Libya , Syria , Sudan , North Korea and Cuba .
Previously , the administration allowed companies to sell the most powerful scrambling technology only to specific industries overseas ; other foreign customers were generally limited to so-called 56-bit encryption products , meaning those with 72-quadrillion unlocking combinations .
`` This is a sweeping reform , '' said Dan Scheinman , senior vice president of legal and government affairs at Cisco Systems Inc .
`` Imagine you 're banking online -- you want to make sure those things are safe from a hacker .
You buy things , you want to make sure your credit card is secure . ''
The export limits never directly affected Americans , who are legally free to use encryption technology of any strength .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But U.S. companies have been reluctant to develop one version of their technology for domestic use and a weaker overseas version , so they typically sell only the most powerful type that 's legal for export , even to Americans .</ENAMEX>
`` Forcing U.S. companies to do business under tight export controls was like asking them to use a black rotary telephone in a cellular , call-waiting world , '' said Harris Miller , president of the Information Technology Association of America , a trade group .
Critics cited more than 800 products available worldwide with stronger scrambling technology than the United States allowed its companies to sell overseas .
`` You can pull it down over the Internet in less than 20 minutes , '' said Gillespie .
`` Having Japanese and German and Irish companies be at the forefront of this technology is not in our best interests . ''
A non-profit group of researchers demonstrated last summer it can unscramble a 56-bit coded message in just days using a custom-built computer worth less than $ 250,000 .
The White House announcement follows its decision exactly one year ago to relax export restrictions .
At the time , Gore promised the administration would reconsider its limits within the year .
