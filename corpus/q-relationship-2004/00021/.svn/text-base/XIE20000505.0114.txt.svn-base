LUANDA , May 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda has advised all the African countries to abstain the support for the imminent Togolese presidency of the Organization of the African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- .
According to the minister , this attitude of the Angolan government is based on the United Nations report on the sanctions against the Angolan rebels which asked the regional organizations to avoid organizing and holding international or regional meetings in the countries cited by the U. N. report as major supporters for the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi .
But according to the decision made at last summit of OAU , Togo will assume the presidency of the Pan - African organization in July of this year .
The present presidency of OAU is assumed by Algeria .
Miranda made the declaration when meeting with the African ambassadors to Angola during which he informed them of the U.N. report on the sanctions against Jonas Savimbi that was put forward by the head of the U.N. Angola Sanction Committee Robert Fowler in early March .
The minister solicited the support from the diplomats for the engagement and collaboration in the application of the sanctions imposed by U.N. `` At this moment , Togo is unsuitable for lodging and presiding the next OAU summit , '' Miranda stressed .
The Togolese government has been accused by Angola of violating the U.N. sanctions against Savimbi by providing education opportunities for the relatives of Savimbi , said local analysts .
