VIENNA , Austria --
The key to raising the price of oil , OPEC has decided , is found more in politics than economics .
After a decade of internecine fighting over which country should produce how much oil , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut through a lot of haggling here Tuesday to reach a production-cutting accord that was underpinned by the strength of newly arrived at political alliances .
The deal struck with four major independent oil-producing countries to withhold 2.1 million barrels a day from the market marks a departure for OPEC , where the dominant policy makers have over the years been oil ministers .
By contrast , this agreement -- which will reduce OPEC production by nearly 8 percent , and global output about 3 percent -- was created by diplomats , princes and prime ministers .
It was no coincidence that the principal component of the deal was a new political truce struck between Saudi Arabia and its political and ideological rival in the Persian Gulf , Iran .
It was remarkable that a deal over oil production involved visits by Iran 's foreign minister and oil minister to the Saudi capital late in February and early in March , followed by telephone negotiations between Crown Prince Abdullah , the effective leader of Saudi Arabia , and President Mohammed Khatami of Iran .
`` Saudi Arabia could see that the huge drop in revenues due to lower oil prices was hurting the moderate president of Iran , '' said former Algerian Oil Minister Nordine Ait - Laoussine , who observed the OPEC meeting here and knows his way around the economics and politics that govern the Middle East .
`` Khatami was coming under pressure from fundamentalist hard-liners in Iran , which is not in the best Saudi interest .
Abdullah knows he ca n't have bad relations with both Iran and Iraq , '' Ait - Laoussine said .
`` After all , he lives in that neighborhood . ''
For Prince Abdullah , Ait - Laoussine continued , an agreement to raise prices by cutting production `` was the only way of helping Khatami in Iran and easing the pressure on the budget in Saudi Arabia . ''
Nor was the pact disconnected from Venezuela 's new government , installed a month and a half ago .
It reversed a policy of violating OPEC production limits practiced by the previous administration , which had little regard for Venezuela 's status as a founding OPEC member .
The new government declared itself in alignment with OPEC and blamed the previous policy for contributing to a devastating fall in oil prices and income .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The depressed price of crude oil over the last year also helped persuade four big independent oil producers -- Mexico , Norway , Oman and Russia -- to amend their own free-market stance .
The four have in a way become de facto members of OPEC by agreeing to cut their production levels</ENAMEX> .
Such ideological and political shifts were buttressed by a change in relations with the big multinational oil companies that OPEC once considered adversaries .
After decades of battling big oil for political and physical control of prices and production , OPEC won -- only to find itself in the same trenches .
With the steep fall in prices , both producers and companies are bleeding , eager to cooperate to reverse the trend .
It is no coincidence that Iran , Algeria , Iraq , Kuwait and even Saudi Arabia are inviting the companies they kicked out 30 years ago to come back and invest in their oil industries .
`` Nothing moves markets like fear , '' said Peter Gignoux , manager of the petroleum trading desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London .
`` Around the oil markets today , you will not find a bear .
All wish OPEC good luck . ''
Of course , even the best intentions can falter .
Prices that had moved up in anticipation of OPEC 's production cuts weakened today for a second day on the possibility that some producers would try to cheat and sell more oil .
Crude oil for May delivery fell 17 cents a barrel , settling in New York trading at $ 15.34 .
Still , cheating is widely viewed as less likely now than it was in the past , because OPEC members seem to have learned the consequences of subverting their own agreements .
The Middle East Economic Survey , an authoritative newsletter in its coverage of the oil business , commented , `` OPEC has at last succeeded in coming to grips with the core of the problem of intolerably low oil prices , that there is no alternative to cutting oil production . ''
OPEC and its new fellow travelers do have some hurdles remaining .
Iraq , for example , is not part of the accord , and has nearly doubled its production in the last year under the United Nations oil-for-food program , to 2.7 million barrels a day .
The Iraqis have promised to push this to three million barrels a day .
There is also the problem of weak world demand .
The use of oil in Asia , which is mired in economic problems , has yet to pick up .
At least with Iraq , it appears that the eventual solution will be , again , politics .
Speaking to journalists in Vienna on Tuesday , Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rashid pointed at the way , saying : `` Iraq needs to be consulted , and a dialogue should be established with us .
Without this , we will not concern ourselves . ''
Translation : Make a political deal with Iraq similar to the deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran .
