HONG KONG , May 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- East Asian countries were urged to further enhance intra-regional trade and tourism to step up the region 's economic recovery , a senior Thai banking official said here Saturday .
`` It is absolutely essential for the governments of Asian countries to understand and appreciate the new trend of regional relationships , '' Olarn Chaipravat , director of the Thailand -based Siam Commercial Bank , told an international conference here on global economic transformation after the Asian economic crisis .
The director also urged Asian countries , particularly those in East Asia , to take advantage of the changing circumstances .
Since April 1999 , the intraregional trade and tourism within Asia have increased sharply -- so much so that if Asian countries continue their existing expansionary fiscal and intra-regional trade promotion policies , higher interest rates and a modest slowdown in the U.S. economy will not derail the strong recovery of Asia , the Siam director said .
International trade and financial positions of Asian countries are much stronger and intra-regional dependency has deepened , Olarn said .
Over 100 financial analysts and scholars from around the world attended the two-day event , which was co-organized by faculties of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Beijing University .
