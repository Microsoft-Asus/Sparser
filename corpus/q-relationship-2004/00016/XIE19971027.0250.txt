JERUSALEM , October 26 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed his concern to Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov about the alleged Russian assistance to Iran in developing missile and nuclear programs .
At a joint press conference after a two-hour meeting with Primakov , Netanyahu said he had discussed with the visiting Russian minister Israel 's concern about the threat posed by Iran in developing various weapon systems .
`` We are , as you know , concerned with the issue of Iran 's various weapon systems .
And we are trying to have a common basis of the fact in order to try to address something that ... concerns Israel a great deal , '' Netanyahu said .
Netanyahu praised Russia for its role as the co-sponsor , together with the United States , of the Israeli - Arab peace process since the 1991 Madrid conference and for its mediation efforts in defusing the tension between Israel and Syria last year .
He added that Israel is looking forward to such positive contributions from Russia to advancing the peace process .
He stressed that it is one of main concerns of his government to turn a new page in the Israeli - Russian relationship by developing it in the spirit of friendship and promoting mutual interests .
For his part , Primakov , who arrived here today from Damascus , denied once again the reports that Russia had transferred any technology that could promote Iran 's massive destructive weapon systems .
Primakov made the same denial at his meeting earlier today with his Israeli counterpart David Levy .
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Levy , he denounced the reports about Russian arms sales to Iran as rumors .
The Russian minister said he had discussed with Netanyahu all aspects of the latest developments in the Middle East peace process , including the Israeli - Palestinian negotiations and the deadlock in the Israeli - Syrian peace talks .
He expressed the hope that the Middle East would achieve a stable peace , to which Russia would continue making its contributions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">On his talks with Syrian President Hafez al- Assad , Primakov said that Assad had reaffirmed his commitment to continuing the peace process with Israel , but the Syrian leader insisted that the talks would be restarted from the point where it was broke off last year with Israel 's previous Labor government .</ENAMEX>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been deadlocked since early 1996 , especially after the access to power by Netanyahu 's hardline government in May last year .
Although Israel has repeatedly called for the unconditional resumption of the peace talks , Syria has been insisting that the talks should not be resumed anew but start from the point when they were suspended , namely on the promise made by the Labor government to totally withdraw Israeli troops from the occupied Golan Heights .
The issue of South Lebanese conflict was also discussed during the Netanyahu - Primakov meeting .
Primakov said the Lebanon issue was very important to achieve peace in the Middle East , adding that Russia is ready to send its forces to South Lebanon to participate in the peacekeeping efforts there .
His remarks confirmed earlier reports that Primakov , during his talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-sharaa , reacted favorably to the idea of Russia 's participation of the international monitoring committee observing the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah reached in April last year .
The current members of the observing committee are the United States , France , Israel , Lebanon and Syria .
Primakov is to hold a meeting with Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon this evening , which is believed to focus on a big deal on Israeli purchase of natural gas from Russia .
Israel is trying to award Moscow with some financial benefits as a way to discourage the cash-strapped Russia from assisting Iran 's missile and nuclear programs for economic considerations .
On Monday morning , Primakow is also to hold further discussions with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Israeli security concerns .
He then will travel to the West Bank city Ramallah to hold talks with officials of the Palestinian National Authority -LRB- PNA -RRB- on advancing the peace process .
It is not clear if he would meet with PNA President Yasser Arafat .
Primakov is currently on a week-long Middle East tour that aims to strengthen Russia 's role in the Middle East peace process .
The tour has taken him to Lebanon and Syria , and will take him to the Palestinian self-rule areas , Jordan and Egypt .
