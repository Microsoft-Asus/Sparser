The <span class="Emphasis2">notochord</span> is formed from dorsal mesoderm that condenses just above the archenteron, and the neural tube originates as a plate of dorsal ectoderm just above the developing notochord. The neural plate soon folds inward, rolling itself into the <span class="Emphasis2">neural tube,</span> which will become the central nervous system--the brain and spinal cord. These organs are hollow in most chordates because of this mechanism of development. In frogs the notochord elongates and stretches the embryo along its anterior-posterior axis. Later, the notochord will function as a core around which mesodermal cells gather and form the vertebrae. Parts of the notochord between the vertebrae persist as the vertebral discs in adults. (These are the discs that can "slip," causing back pain.)</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig47-11','../fig/big/fig47-11.jpg','fig47-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig47-11.jpg" alt="fig47-11" name="myfig47-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 47-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Organogenesis in a frog embryo.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Other condensations occur in strips of mesoderm lateral to the notochord, which separate into blocks called <span class="Emphasis2">somites.</span> The somites are arranged serially on both sides along the length of the notochord (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 47.11c</span>). Cells from the somites not only give rise to the vertebrae of the backbone, they also form the muscles associated with the axial skeleton. This serial origin of the axial skeleton and muscles reinforces the point made in Chapter 34 that chordates are basically segmented animals, although the segmentation becomes less obvious later in development. (There are signs of segmentation even in the adult, as in the series of vertebrae in a human or the segments of chevron-shaped muscles in a fish.) Lateral to the somites, the mesoderm splits into two layers that form the lining of the body cavity, or coelom.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">As organogenesis progresses, morphogenesis and cellular differentiation continue to refine the organs that arise from the three embryonic germ layers. Review TABLE 47.1, which lists the embryonic sources of the major organs and tissues in frogs and other vertebrates. Unique to vertebrate embryos, a band of cells called the <span class="Emphasis1">neural crest</span> develops along the border where the neural tube pinches off from the ectoderm. Cells of the neural crest subsequently migrate to various parts of the embryo, forming pigment cells of the skin, some of the bones and muscles of the skull, the teeth, the medulla of the adrenal glands, and peripheral components of the nervous system, such as sensory and sympathetic ganglia.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Embryonic development of the frog leads to a larval stage, the tadpole, which hatches from the jelly coat that originally cloaked the egg. Later, metamorphosis will transform the frog from the aquatic, herbivorous tadpole to the terrestrial, carnivorous adult.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
