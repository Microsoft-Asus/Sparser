Recall from Chapter 8 that osmosis, a special case of diffusion, is the movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane. It occurs whenever two solutions separated by the membrane differ in osmotic pressure, or <span class="Emphasis2">osmolarity</span> (total solute concentration expressed as molarity, or moles of solute per liter of solution; see Chapter 3). The unit of measurement for osmolarity used in this chapter is milliosmoles per liter (mosm/L); 1 mosm/L is equivalent to a total solute concentration of 10<SUP>-3</SUP><span class="Emphasis1">M</span>. The osmolarity of human blood is about 300 mosm/L, while seawater has an osmolarity of about 1,000 mosm/L. Two solutions separated by a selectively permeable membrane are said to be isoosmotic if they have the same osmolarity.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">There is no <span class="Emphasis1">net</span> movement of water by osmosis between isoosmotic solutions (although water molecules are continually crossing the membrane, they do so at equal rates in both directions). When two solutions differ in osmolarity, the one with the greater concentration of solutes is referred to as hyperosmotic and the more dilute solution as hypoosmotic. Water flows by osmosis from a hypoosmotic solution to a hyperosmotic one.<A href="javascript:popNote('44','1')"><SUP><B>*</B></SUP></A></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
