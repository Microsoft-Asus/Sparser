The Rainbow Warrior and its 16 crew members remained in the port of Muisne , 115 miles -LRB- 190 kilometers -RRB- northwest of Quito , on Tuesday .
They had planned to leave for Costa Rica .
`` We do not understand why the port captain of Muisne has detained our ship , '' said a Greenpeace communique read over a radio station .
