ASHGABAT , Turkmenistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Iran failed to secure an agreement for transporting Turkmenistan 's gas to world markets , as a visiting Iranian minister and the Turkmen president could not agree on the price during a meeting Thursday .
Iran 's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi offered Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov dlrs 32 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas .
But Niyazov refused , adding that Turkmenistan has even rejected Russia 's offer of dlrs 36 per per 1,000 cubic meters .
Transporting Turkmenistan 's gas through Iran is the shortest and cheapest route .
However , the United States strongly opposes the plan , because it considers Iran unreliable , and favors pipeline routes to Turkey .
Turkmenistan , eager to end its poverty through lucrative gas sales , is considering both routes .
But so far , it has failed to agree to a pipeline to Turkey either .
On Thursday , Niyazov said that his country first wants to settle a dispute with Azerbaijan -- a country through which the pipeline to Turkey would pass -- over Caspian oil fields .
Of the five nations bordering the Caspian , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores .
But Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan both have claims on the same oil fields .
Russia and Iran , which have little or no oil near their coasts , want the sea 's resources to be shared by all .
Kharrazi is to travel to Kazakstan on Friday .
