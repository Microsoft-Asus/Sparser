RELATING MENDELISM TO CHROMOSOMES

 

 Mendelian inheritance has its physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles



 

 Morgan traced a gene to a specific chromosome



 

 Linked genes tend to be inherited together because they are located on the same chromosome



 

 Independent assortment of chromosomes and crossing over produce genetic recombinants



 

 Geneticists can use recombination data to map a chromosome's genetic loci
