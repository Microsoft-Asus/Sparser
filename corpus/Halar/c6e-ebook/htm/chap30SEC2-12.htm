The ancestry of angiosperms is still uncertain, but, as discussed earlier, cladistic analysis of gene-sequence data points to <span class="Emphasis1">Amborella</span> and water lilies such as <span class="Emphasis1">Nymphaea</span> as the closest living relatives of early angio sperms (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 30.11</span>). The oldest fossils that are widely accepted as angiosperms are found in rocks of the early Cretaceous period that are about 130 million years old. In such rock strata, angiosperms are sparsely represented among a much greater abundance of ferns and gymnosperms. By the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, following a period of environmental disturbance, the angiosperms had radiated and become the dominant plants on Earth, as they are today. The change in fossils during the late Cretaceous is so extreme that geologists use the end of that period as the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
