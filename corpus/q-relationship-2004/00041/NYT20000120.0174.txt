MEXICO CITY --
Mexican officials put a quiet end this week to excavations for alleged mass graves containing victims of drug traffickers in the northern border city of Juarez .
It was an investigation that started with a spectacular burst of publicity last November and raised hopes that the remains of between 100 and 200 people missing in the Juarez area might be found by American FBI agents and Mexican officials working together .
In the end , Mexican officials said Thursday , the bodies of only nine people believed to have been killed by traffickers were found in four different sites .
The binational operation also caused a stir in Mexico because a number of politicians questioned why authorities here felt they had to request expert assistance from the FBI to uncover the graves .
Digging was halted in Juarez on Wednesday , Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo told Mexican senators and reporters during an appearance at the Senate here Thursday .
He said U.S. and Mexican officials are still conducting DNA testing to positively identify the remains of the nine dead , who are believed to have been killed by gunmen working for the Juarez -based Carrillo Fuentes drug-trafficking cartel .
Madrazo said witnesses are still being interviewed in connection with the case and that additional digging could resume if more information is obtained about other possible graves .
Some of the missing in the Juarez area are Americans .
Officials on both sides of the border said they hoped they would find some of the disappeared in graves on scattered ranches that were identified by informants .
Madrazo blamed leaks of erroneous information to the American press for inflating expectations that authorities would find mass graves containing dozens of bodies .
During testimony before senators on Thursday , Madrazo was forced to explain why he asked for the help of up to 72 FBI experts in forensic investigations and other criminal probes .
Some senators said the FBI presence violated Mexico 's sovereignty or implied the Attorney General 's office was too incompetent to conduct its own probe .
Much of the information about the whereabouts of graves stemmed from tips to the FBI in El Paso , Texas , across the border from Juarez .
`` It 's very important to mention that none of the FBI elements collaborating with the Attorney General 's office are acting as authorities or an invading police force , '' a defensive Madrazo told senators .
`` All the evidence is being controlled by the Attorney General 's office . ''
Mexico and the United States have agreed since 1940 to allow the presence of some FBI agents in Mexico , Madrazo added .
Mexican senator Adolfo Aguilar Zinser , a chief critic of the use of FBI agents in Juarez , agreed that Mexican law allows for cooperation .
But he called Mexican officials `` incompetent '' and questioned why they had to rely on so many foreign experts .
`` Mexico had the technology , '' he said , `` but it did n't have the credibility to apply it . ''
Mexican law enforcement in general is under pressure to prove at home and abroad that it is becoming more competent and less susceptible to bribes by the powerful Mexican drug cartels that operate in various cities here .
Witnesses say many of the disappeared in Juarez were last seen in the custody of state or federal police .
Madrazo said the search for graves was intended to strike a blow against the Juarez -based cartel and the police who have served as its protectors .

On Thursday Madrazo was asked whether the graves operation was linked to the annual `` certification '' of nations working with the United States to halt international drug smuggling .
Next month the Clinton administration will recommend whether the U.S. Congress should certify Mexico as a reliable drug-fighting partner .
Mexico has long opposed certification , calling it a unilateral and counter-productive action that angers Mexicans rather than encouraging cooperation .
`` All -LRB- certification -RRB- generates is tension .
And that tension only benefits the drug traffickers , '' Madrazo said , denying any link between the search for graves and certification .
Madrazo also explained why he recently called for Mexican law enforcement to use the names of the individuals who run Mexico 's most notorious cartels rather than the names of the cities where they are based .
Residents of Juarez and Tijuana , another border city , complain their cities ' images have been unfairly smeared because they are known as the homes of the two most violent cartels .
`` I think it 's an absolutely unjust stigmatization of those cities , '' Madrazo said .
