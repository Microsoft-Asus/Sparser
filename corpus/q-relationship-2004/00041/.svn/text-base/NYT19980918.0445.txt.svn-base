MEXICO CITY --
After a nearly three-year inquiry into drug corruption in Mexico , Swiss police investigators have concluded that a brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari played a central role in Mexico 's cocaine trade , raking in huge bribes to protect the flow of drugs into the United States .
In a secret , 369-page report , the investigators assert that Salinas ' elder brother , Raul , used his wide influence in the administration to organize an elaborate network of protection for drug smugglers .
He also channeled drug money to his brother 's presidential campaign , the report alleges .
`` When Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president of Mexico in 1988 , Raul Salinas de Gortari assumed control over practically all drug shipments through Mexico , '' the report states .
`` Through his influence and bribes paid with drug money , officials of the army and the police supported and protected the flourishing drug business . ''
From a low-profile position in the administration 's food-distribution agency , the report states , Raul Salinas commandeered government trucks and railroad cars to haul cocaine north .
On what some of his reputed former associates referred to as `` green-light days , '' he arranged for drug loads to transit Mexico without concern that they might be checked by the army , the coast guard or the federal police .
A partial copy of the report , which appears to be based largely on interviews with unidentified witnesses , was obtained by The New York Times .
Swiss officials said they expected it to be the basis for their government 's seizure in the coming weeks of more than $ 130 million that Raul Salinas deposited in Swiss banks .
Lawyers for Raul Salinas , who received a copy of the report about two months ago , dismissed it Friday as the slanderous product of a Swiss crusade to confiscate what they insist is a fortune that their client earned by legitimate means .
`` The report is absolutely false , '' Salinas ' lead attorney , Eduardo Luengo Creel , said in an interview .
`` It contains statements , assertions and situations that do not correspond to the facts .
It is a police report ; it does not have the validity of an evaluation by an investigating judge .
`` We do not even know who these people are , '' Luengo said of the many confidential informants listed in the document .
`` To accuse someone with anonymous witnesses is unconstitutional in any country that enjoys the rule of law . ''
The report states that Swiss investigators were unable to determine conclusively what involvement the former president , his father and other family members might have had in the purportedly illicit activities of Raul Salinas .
Some relatives , it implies , were among a group of people around Raul Salinas who were implicated in criminal activities by witnesses whom the report describes as `` principally credible '' ; it does not name any of those people .
The report also notes that the investigators did not look further into the matter , because the people mentioned were irrelevant to their inquiry into whether Salinas ' Swiss funds came from illegal activities .
Somewhat obliquely , the report adds : `` We have to seriously question the probability that a person with as much power as the president of Mexico for years did not learn about criminal activities of this extent , even if his brother was heavily involved . ''
The Swiss report is by far the most exhaustive assessment to date of Raul Salinas ' reported dealings with the Mexican underworld .
It is clearly a prosecutorial document , one that cites Salinas ' own version of events mostly to show how it appears to contradict other facts .
Because the seizure of Salinas ' assets would be a civil-court action , the report also aims at a considerably lower threshold of proof than would be required in a criminal case .
Raul Salinas was widely rumored to have grown rich on dubious business dealings during his brother 's presidency , but the accusations were almost never public or specific .
Shortly after Carlos Salinas stepped down in December 1994 , his chosen successor , Ernesto Zedillo , shattered a long Mexican tradition of impunity for presidential families by authorizing Raul Salinas ' arrest on charges that he ordered the murder of a leader of the governing party who was Raul 's former brother-in-law .
In the tiny maximum-security prison cell where Salinas has spent the last three and a half years , he has been struck by wave after wave of new allegations .
Federal prosecutors in New York are pressing ahead with a criminal investigation into the possibility that he may have laundered illicit funds through his accounts at Citibank headquarters in New York .
And after a series of reversals in their murder case , Mexican officials say they are close to announcing new corruption charges against him .
Much of the Swiss evidence seems to come from witnesses who are identified only by pseudonyms like `` Ludmilla '' and `` Juan , '' and whose credibility is difficult to judge .
As the true names of several of those witnesses have leaked out , Salinas ' lawyers have attacked their accounts .
But even when the informants are convicted criminals , the report often highlights reasons that their claims are credible .
Legal experts in Switzerland and the United States predicted that the confidentiality of the sources arrayed against Salinas might well prove a weak point in the Swiss government 's case .
If a seizure is ordered and lawyers for Salinas challenge it in court , as they insist they will , the judge who evaluates the case will have access to the witnesses ' identities .
Lawyers will not necessarily be able to investigate their backgrounds , and the police report is not expected to be made public .
In contrast to law-enforcement officials in the United States , who have studied Mexican drug corruption for years , the small team of Swiss federal police investigators had virtually no background in the subject .
But since their arrest of Salinas ' third wife , Paulina Castanon , as she tried to retrieve phony passports with her husband 's picture from a Swiss safe-deposit box in November 1995 , the Swiss detectives managed to scour U.S. court files and jail cells for anyone who might claim a link to their target .
In at least a few such cases , U.S. law-enforcement officials have acknowledged , those informants had been ignored or misused by prosecutors in the United States until the Swiss sought them out .
The Swiss report also cites some confidential witnesses who are described as people who once worked or socialized around Salinas , and it contains what two American investigators described as a meticulous analysis of his financial dealings .
`` For us , what they have would be a triable case , '' said one U.S. law-enforcement official who is familiar with the Swiss evidence .
`` It would n't be a slam-dunk , but you could definitely take it to court . ''
For the family of a former president who was once celebrated as the bold architect of a new relationship between Mexico and the United States -- the man who fathered the North American Free Trade Agreement and brought to power a new generation of Ivy -educated technocrats -- the report paints a devastating portrait .
Both Raul and Carlos , the report contends , were introduced to the drug trade in the late 1970s by their father , Raul Salinas Lozano , a former government minister .
`` Raul Salinas Lozano , with his political influence , would have preferred Raul at the head of the government in Mexico , '' it continues , quoting an informant close to the family to present a dark new twist on an old story of brotherly ambition .
`` But because Raul Salinas de Gortari 's infamous earlier life would not have permitted him to hold a high-level government position , the father decided to support his son Carlos instead . ''
Long before Carlos Salinas began to make his name in the mid-1980s as Mexico 's young , Harvard -trained budget minister , the report suggests , his father had built a friendship with one of the legendary figures of Mexico 's northern-border drug trade , Juan Guerra .
Such a relationship has been reported in the past , and angrily denied by Raul Salinas Lozano .
The eldest son of the one-time border senator -- Salinas Lozano was a dominant figure in the politics of his home state of Nuevo Leon -- and a nephew of the trafficker , Juan Garcia Abrego , inherited the connection , the report contends .
Quoting a series of former drug traffickers , the Swiss investigators state that Raul Salinas began arranging protection for both Garcia Abrego and traffickers of Colombia 's Medellin cartel even before his brother became president .
One of those traffickers , identified as `` Giuseppe , '' appears to be Jose Manuel Ramos , a former Colombian cocaine distributor who operated out of northern Mexico and Texas until his arrest in 1990 .
Three U.S. law-enforcement officials familiar with his case described Ramos , who remains in prison , as highly credible .
Both Ramos and his wife , Luz Salazar , or `` Ludmilla , '' referred the Swiss detectives to payment ledgers and other documents that had been seized at the time of their arrest in Houston to show that over a two-year period between 1987 and 1989 , they themselves paid Salinas $ 28.7 million .
