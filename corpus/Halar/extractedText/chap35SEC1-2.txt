THE PROCESS OF PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

 

 Meristems generate cells for new organs throughout the lifetime of a plant: an overview of plant growth



 

 Primary growth: Apical meristems extend roots and shoots by giving rise to the primary plant body



 

 Secondary growth: Lateral meristems add girth by producing secondary vascular tissue and periderm



A plant's continuous growth and development depend on processes that shape organs and generate specific patterns of specialized cells and tissues within those organs. Growth is the irreversible increase in mass that results from cell division and cell expansion. Development is the sum of all of the changes that progressively elaborate an organism's body. The early stages of growth and development--germination of the seed and emergence of the seedling--are among the topics of Chapter 38. Here we will study how plants continue to grow after their shoot and root systems are established.
