MOSCOW , January 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin on Wednesday denied as `` unfounded '' Japanese newspaper reports on a possible interim agreement on transferring two South Kuril islands to Japan .
Karasin , who is in charge of drafting a peace treaty with Japan , said such reports `` are aimed at disrupting public opinion , '' Interfax reported .
Japanese mass media recently reported that Tokyo is considering the possibility of concluding an interim agreement with Moscow on the transfer of two of the four disputed South Kuril islands to Japan and continuing talks on the territorial status of the remaining two islands .
The four islands , known as the Northern Territories in Japan , have stalled relations between Moscow and Tokyo for decades .
The long island chain was given to Japan in 1875 by Russia in exchange for the northern half of Sakhalin Island .
During the Second World War , Russia retook the islands from Japan along with the southern half of Sakhalin .
In 1951 , Japan relinquished all claims to the islands but later reversed its stance on the southern Kurils , stating that these islands had always been Japanese possessions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In 1996 , the governments of the two countries restarted discussions over territorial sovereignty and fishing rights in order to find a peaceful solution .</ENAMEX>
At a regular press conference Wednesday , Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin also denied the Japanese reports as `` sheer fabrication . ''
Moscow is guided by the `` need to find a mutually-acceptable solution to the territorial problem without affecting the two countries ' state interests , political positions and dignity , '' Rakhmanin said .
