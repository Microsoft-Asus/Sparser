DAYTON , Ohio --
People are talking about psychology again , and the talk is hot .
This time it 's like the telephone game -- the last messages are really juicy , but then you find out the first one , and it is so dull that you suspect someone substituted a completely different message .
Gina Dalfonzo of the Family Research Council denounced a recent American Psychological Association study on child sexual abuse , as well as cultural forces that `` are making pedophilia look attractive to its potential victims . ''
Dalfonzo referred to `` a coalition of family groups , psychologists and members of Congress '' who are equally displeased with the APA study .
She added that Dr. Laura Schlessinger also has things to say about all this -- namely , that the study is `` junk science . ''
I am a psychologist , and where I come from , an accusation of `` junk science '' is like tomatoes and eggs on your car .
Here is what the fuss is about : The APA 's Psychological Bulletin -LRB- 1998 , vol .
124 -RRB- featured a study entitled `` A Meta - Analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College Samples . ''
For those not familiar with the term , a meta-analysis examines data from a set of studies in order to answer some research question .
This particular study examined the assumptions that child sexual abuse causes harm in a manner that is `` pervasive , '' `` intense '' and `` an equivalent experience for boys and girls . ''
Their conclusion was that child sexual abuse `` does not cause intense harm on a pervasive basis regardless of gender in the college population . ''
If readers take the authors ' conclusions at face value -- which I recommend -- they will discover that the authors are clear and conservative in stating their findings .
They do n't say pedophilia is OK .
They do n't even come close .
For example , they do discuss the usefulness of new terms -LRB- `` adult-adolescent sex , '' etc. -RRB- .
But they clearly explain that the idea is to have more precise language among researchers , so these researchers can produce better science about child sexual abuse .
I actually scoured the APA piece for misstatements , overstatements , anything that could be construed as dramatic enough to make Dr. Laura 's Web page .
I came up empty .
In contrast , her Web page offered all sorts of misstatements and drama -- now here was a critic 's smorgasbord .
Dr. Laura stated that the article in question `` proposes that psychologists stop using judgmental terms like ` child-abuse , ' ` molestation ' and ` victims . ' ''
Her statement ignored the authors ' very complete explanation of the reason for using more specific terms in the scientific community .
It also ignored their discussion of the relationships among scientific , legal and moral perspectives on child sexual abuse .
It 's right in the article , should she care to go back and look .
Dr. Laura also found reason to muse about a scenario in which `` psychology indeed recognizes consensual pedophilia as harmless . ''
How did she get there ?
Perhaps she did not read the article , because she is also under the impression that it is an `` overview of all -LRB- emphasis mine -RRB- the research studying the harm resulting from childhood sexual abuse . ''
Wow .
`` A '' for effort to anyone who even tries to write that one .
Allow me to say that I am fascinated when people criticize scientific studies on the basis of their topics or their conclusions alone .
Science is the business of asking questions , savory or unsavory , and people may not always like what they find .
In any case , if critics want to get into the game , they will have to do more than shout from the sidelines .
It is not enough to skim read .
It is not enough to read excerpts or , worse yet , to force the subject material into a completely different agenda -LRB- although that will make the critic more scientifically interesting -RRB- .
Dispute the statistical methodology .
Replicate the study and get different results .
That will get you in the ring .
Or there is another option .
Some may not realize that studies published in APA journals do not necessarily represent the APA 's official stance .
Journal editors are interested in presenting quality science .
If people have concerns about the APA 's stance with regard to pedophiles or child sexual abuse survivors , they should be more interested in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , or DSM .
This is the book that outlines diagnostic criteria for psychological disorders .
Keep in mind that debate , hashing and rehashing is everyday stuff to the DSM people , so you 'll have to get your thinking cap on really good before you knock on that door .
Of course , there are other hot topics from which to choose .
I have one : Investigate how Dr. Laura , in good conscience , can present herself as `` Dr . ''
in an advice-giving profession when her Ph.D. is in a different field .
Now that is scandal material .
Romy L. Cawood , Ph.D. is a counseling psychologist
