The chief federal prosecutor 's office said Wednesday that an extreme-leftist Turk suspected of being a leader in a terrorist organization has been arrested in Germany .
The office in Karlsruhe identified the suspect only as 43-year -old Mesut D.. It said he was arrested Tuesday during searches at 11 homes and two clubs allegedly frequented by members of the extreme-leftist Karatas wing of the banned Turkish extremist group Devrimci Sol .
The homes were located in North - Rhine Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Baden - Wuerttemberg and Bavaria state .
The two clubs were in Cologne and Stuttgart .
Mostly propaganda material was confiscated , the statement said .
It said that Mesut D. is suspected of being a leader of the group in the Cologne area .
The Interior Ministry banned Karatas and its rival splinter group , Yagan , on Aug. 13 , saying they finance their activities largely by blackmailing Turkish residents and businesses in Germany .
Both groups split off from Devrimci Sol in 1992 and have long used violence and murder to gain dominance in Germany , home to some 2 million Turks .
Both have a combined membership of about 1,300 and have adopted Devrimci Sol 's goal of overthrowing the Turkish government to replace it with a Marxist regime , according to the ministry .
In June several Karatas members were arrested for suspected blackmail , murder and attempted murder in Germany .
Prosecutors at the time said the leader of the Karatas wing ordered members to attack and sometimes kill Yagan wing members and Turks unwilling to contribute money .
They also blame the group for arson attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany .
Germany banned Devrimci Sol in 1983 .
