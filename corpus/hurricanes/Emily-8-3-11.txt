-- Short blurb on WHDH weather site

Rain from Tropical Storm Emily has begun falling in Puerto Rico as the system moves on a track that could take it to Florida by the end of the week.

While we're tracking Tropical Storm Emily and it'll get closer to the East Coast by Sunday, it'll still be down off the coast of the Carolinas by then.

Hurricane Emily, which is moving its way across the Caribbean, is now on course for the island of Hispaniola, split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Both countries are on hurricane alert and the former has ordered evacuations, still vulnerable after the earthquake it suffered last year. Miami's National Hurricane Center predicts that the storm's centre will pass over the island late today and then onto the Southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos tomorrow. There are also possible risks of tropical storms for the U.S. Virgin Islands over the next few hours.
