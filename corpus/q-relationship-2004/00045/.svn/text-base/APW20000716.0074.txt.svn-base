BUFFALO , N.Y .
-LRB- AP -RRB- - The FBI is investigating a gambling ring connected to organized crime that uses a toll free 1-800 telephone number and an offshore office in the Dominican Republic to take bets .
Federal agents and prosecutors say payoffs and collections are made by members of a Mafia -linked group headed by one of western New York 's longtime bookies , Benjamin `` Sonny '' Nicoletti of Lewiston in Niagara County .
Nicoletti has not been charged , but the U.S. attorney 's office has filed papers in U.S. District Court regarding the suspected gambling ring .
`` I ca n't talk about the case beyond what is stated in court papers , but I can tell you , as far as the government concerned , this arrangement is illegal , '' prosecutor Anthony M. Bruce said .
`` Bookmaking has been outlawed in New York state .
So if you have a bookmaking operation and part of the bookmaking activity takes place in New York state , we would definitely consider that to be illegal activity . ''
Nicoletti 's attorney , Joel L. Daniels , declined to comment on the allegations , except to say that he is aware the FBI is trying to build a bookmaking case against him .
`` The investigation is based on allegations that Nicoletti is a member or associate of the Buffalo La Cosa Nostra family and , as such , controls illegal gambling in the Niagara Falls area , '' FBI Special Agent Robert W. Utz said in court papers .
`` Nicoletti profits handsomely from this arrangement . ''
Law enforcement officials believe the 1-800 ring allegedly run by Nicoletti has been in operation since at least 1997 and takes in millions of dollars in sports wagers each year .
