If a chimpanzee is placed in an area with a banana hung high out of reach and several boxes on the floor, the chimp can "size up" the situation and stack the boxes, enabling it to reach the food. Such novel problem-solving behavior is highly developed in some mammals, especially primates and dolphins, and notable examples have also been observed in some bird species, especially crows, ravens, and jays. Ravens, for example, exhibit marked individual variation in their attempts to solve some of the problems imposed on them by experimenters (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 51.13</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig51-13','../fig/big/fig51-13.jpg','fig51-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig51-13.jpg" alt="fig51-13" name="myfig51-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 51-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Problem solving.</span> Behavioral biologist Bernd Heinrich placed ravens in an experimental situation in which they had to solve the problem of obtaining food hanging from a string. The raven shown here solved the problem by using one foot to pull the string in increments and the other foot to secure the string so the food didn’t just drop again. Of interest was the tremendous individual variation in behavior that Heinrich observed. Some ravens never learned to get at the food, while others solved the problem in different ways.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Watching an animal solve a problem makes us aware that its nervous system has a substantial ability to process information. An expanding research effort on animal cognition seeks to understand information processing at all levels, from the nervous system activities that underlie sophisticated behavior, such as problem solving, to the internal representations animals have about physical objects in their surroundings.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
