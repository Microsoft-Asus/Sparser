									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">One of the revelations of the human genome sequence draft announced in February 2001 was the presence of relict prokaryotic sequences--genes of prokaryotes incorporated into our genome but now defunct molecular fossils. What kinds of mutational changes may have occurred to maroon bacterial genes in our genome?</p>

									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">Researchers have long puzzled over the observation that some prostate cancer cells thrive despite treatments that eliminate testosterone and other androgens usually necessary for prostate cell survival. It has recently been suggested that estrogen, often considered a female hormone, may be activating genes that are normally controlled by an androgen receptor. Describe one or more experiments to test this hypothesis. (The hormones mentioned are all steroids; to review their mode of action, see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.10</span>.)</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">A chemical called dioxin, or TCDD, is produced as a by-product of some chemical manufacturing processes. Trace amounts of this substance were present in Agent Orange, a defoliant sprayed on vegetation during the Vietnam War. There has been a continuing controversy over its effects on soldiers exposed to it during the war. Animal tests have suggested that dioxin can be lethal and can cause birth defects, cancer, liver and thymus damage, and immune system suppression. But its effects on humans are unclear, and even animal tests are equivocal; a hamster is not affected by a dose that can kill a guinea pig. Researchers have discovered that dioxin acts somewhat like a steroid hormone. It enters a cell and binds to a receptor protein, which in turn attaches to the cell’s DNA. How might this mechanism help explain the variety of dioxin’s effects on different body systems and in different animals? How might you determine whether a type of illness is related to dioxin exposure or whether a particular individual became ill as a result of exposure to dioxin? Which would be more difficult to demonstrate? Why?</p>
