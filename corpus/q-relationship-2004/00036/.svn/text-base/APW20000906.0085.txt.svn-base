WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The United States will not accept a Chinese proposal to label Taiwan a `` customs territory of China '' for its entry into the World Trade Organization , President Clinton said in a letter made public Wednesday .
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms , R - N.C. , meanwhile , urged his colleagues to `` stand up for Taiwan '' in the debate over China trade .
Republican Sen. John Kyl of Arizona blasted a Beijing proposal that the document setting out terms for membership in the WTO make it clear that Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau all are part of China , in effect using the WTO to assert its disputed claim to Taiwan .
`` We should hold out the prospect of legislative action , '' said Kyl .
He did not specify what that legislation would do .
Under an agreement signed in 1992 , once China joins the WTO , Taiwan would immediately follow .
Hong Kong is already a member as it is treated as a separate customs territory .
Clinton , in an Aug. 31 letter to Kyl , said his administration has rejected China 's proposal to call Taiwan `` a separate customs territory of China . ''
`` We have advised the Chinese that such language is inappropriate ... and that we will not accept it , '' Clinton 's letter said .
As the bill to normalize trade with China went into its second day of debate in the full Senate , Helms ' committee held a separate hearing on issues related to Taiwan .
`` In a just world , '' said Helms , Taiwan would long ago have been admitted to the 137-member trade organization because it is more advanced economically than China and has for years met the requirements for membership .
Helms and Kyl called for some kind of pressure to prevent China from blocking Taiwan 's WTO membership .
`` I think ...
Congress ought to go ahead and do something , '' said Helms .
`` I think we ought to stand up for Taiwan now . ''
Fellow Republican Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming argued against an amendment to the China trade bill , saying it would delay passage .
`` I think we need to find a way to get that message '' to China without holding up permanent normal trade status , said Craig .
China trade was the first order of business Tuesday as the Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders of both parties determined to approve the permanent normal trade relations -LRB- PNTR -RRB- before lawmakers close shop to campaign before the November elections .
While supporters believe they have a solid majority in the Senate , they face two main problems -- time limitations as Congress rushes to finish its work for the year and the determination of some senators to link normalized trade to China 's weapons proliferation and human rights record .
The House approved the China trade bill last May on a 237-197 vote , and the concern is that any Senate amendments to that bill would effectively kill it for the year because there would n't be time for the two chambers to work out differences between the measures .
In the Senate debate Wednesday , Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana urged support of the bill , saying rejection of PNTR will likely lead to an indefinite delay in Taiwan 's entry into the WTO .
-- The bill is H.R. 4444 .
