JOHANNESBURG , January 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- With higher growth rates than the rest of the sub- Saharan region , the 14-member Southern African Development Community -LRB- SADC -RRB- has become an emerging market with great potential .
According to the latest SADC Finance and Investment report , the SADC has successfully achieved continuous economic growth since the middle of the 1990s thanks to its peacekeeping efforts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- .
The SADC Secretariat has predicted a growth rate of three to 3.5 percent for the year 1999 in the bloc after it recorded a positive growth of 1.7 percent in 1998 .
In 1999 , Mozambique boasted a growth rate of 11.2 percent , followed by Botswana 5.6 percent and Mauritius 5.3 percent , and Mozambican economic growth is expected to hit 10 percent this year .
Prompted by the economic development , the inflation rates in Botswana , Mauritius , Namibia , Lesotho , Tanzania and South Africa all dropped to the lowest level in history .
Attracted by continuous economic improvement , some western countries have increased assistance to the SADC .
In the past two years , the United States provided an economic aid worth 350 million U.S. dollars to help the SADC member states build infrastructures like roads , ports , power plants and irrigation works .
Britain offered 50 percent of its foreign loans to the SADC .
France chose South Africa as a breakthrough-point for its economic ties with the SADC .
The European Union and Japan are actively consolidating the bilateral relationship with the SADC , paving the way for further economic and trade exchanges .
The SADC and EU have jointly announced that they will host a series of conferences to boost foreign investment in southern Africa .
The stable economic development in the sub-region also lays a good foundation for the establishment of a SADC free trade area , which will in turn tap the development potential in the sub-region .
SADC Acting Executive Secretary Preg Ramsamy announced recently that the long-waited SADC Free Trade Agreement will be implemented in April this year .
According to the agreement signed in July 1999 , a free trade zone should be established before 2004 , and by 2008 , tariff imposed on non-sensitive commodities should be removed between the SADC member states .
The implementation of the free trade pact will surely speed up economic development in the SADC or even in the whole Africa .
The recent significant development in the sub-region should also be attributed to the exploitation of mineral resources .
With the increase of natural resources exploration , the overall growth in sub- Saharan Africa may hit four percent in the year 2000 , analysts here predicted .
The GDP of Mozambique , Botswana and Angola this year may well increase by 10 percent , 8.9 percent and eight percent respectively .
The processing and export of mineral products have always been the pillar for most SADC member countries like South Africa , Botswana , Namibia , Angola and the DRC .
The rich natural resource is a unique gift endowed by the nature , providing the SADC member states a wonderful condition to develop their tourism , which has been identified as the key economic drive for the region in the 21st century .
This ever-expanding service sector could by 2010 provide some 650,000 jobs through southern Africa .
Over 1.6 million jobs could also be created directly and indirectly by travel demand across the region 's broad economy .
The regional governments are expected to pool their resources to effect rapid socio-economic development for greater economic cooperation and adequate and effective moves toward economic growth .
As the past year has witnessed , the continuation of the armed conflicts in Angola and the DRC impacted negatively on the economic stability , economic management and investor confidence in the directly involved countries as well as the SADC region at large .
At an extraordinary summit in Maputo earlier this month , heads of state of the SADC countries published a communique urging the U.N. Security Council to send a full peace-keeping force to the DRC to speed up the peace process .
And the U.N. Security Council has voted to send 5,500 military personnel to the DRC to supervise the cease-fire between the government troops and the rebels .
The Angolan government has succeeded in soliciting international support and isolating the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi and taken an upper hand in the central highlands fighting fields .
The anticipated peace in the DRC and Angola would surely further promote the development in the SADC region .
However , stimulating economic growth remains a challenge for the community .
The SADC member countries have to redouble their commitment and act in a true African spirit to ensure that the new millennium became the golden age for Africa .
SADC is a 14-country regional bloc comprising Angola , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Seychelles , Swaziland , Tanzania , Zambia , Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
