BRUSSELS , October 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea and the European Union , despite their dispute over European access to South Korea 's telecoms market , signed a five-year trade agreement here today to boost economic and political ties .
Under the agreement , both sides will grant each other most-favored nation trading status and promote commercial , scientific and technology links .
The two sides , signing the pact on the fringes of the EU Foreign Ministers Council in Luxembourg , were careful to skirt around their row over the EU 's access to South Korea 's telecoms market .
The EU has accused Seoul of loading government telecoms purchases in favor of local suppliers or suppliers from the United States -- with which it has a preferential trade agreement -- and freezing out European companies .
The EU claims Europe 's telecoms businesses lose some 900 million U.S. dollars a year because of South Korea 's telecoms procurement policies and has threatened to take the matter to the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- .
The dispute had delayed the signing of the new trade agreement but the two sides still struck the accord earlier this year after the EU decided there was no prospect of getting the South Koreans to back down on the issue .
South Korea is an important trading partner for the EU .
In 1995 the country was the EU 's tenth biggest export market .
