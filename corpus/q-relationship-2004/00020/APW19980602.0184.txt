BEIJING
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
China on Tuesday blamed India for the nuclear arms race in South Asia while muting criticism of staunch ally Pakistan .
India was `` solely responsible '' because it tested nuclear bombs first , and Pakistan 's tests were a reaction to the nuclear threat from India , Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a briefing .
India 's five detonations in mid- May and a series of Pakistani explosions last week has stirred fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia .
Beijing originally condemned India for its tests but throughout the crisis has struck a more conciliatory line with Pakistan .
Chinese statements have noted Pakistan 's security concerns , while expressing `` regret '' over its nuclear response to India .
Beijing was particularly upset that the Indian government tried to justify its tests by casting nuclear-power China as its main threat .
Relations between the two countries had been improving in recent years despite a dispute over their border .
Although Zhu blamed India on Tuesday for starting the arms race , he also urged both countries to heed growing worldwide support against nuclear testing and proliferation .
`` We believe neither India 's nuclear tests nor Pakistan 's conforms to the historical trend , '' Zhu said .
China calls on both countries to show `` maximum restraint '' and `` immediately abandon nuclear weapons development , '' Zhu said .
Beijing also is urging them to sign the Non -proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , he said .
Zhu also repeated the government 's denial of allegations that it has helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons .
China has always been against the spread of nuclear weapons and has not helped any country acquire them , he said .
