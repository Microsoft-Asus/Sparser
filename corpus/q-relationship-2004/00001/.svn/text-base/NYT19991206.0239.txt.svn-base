UNITED NATIONS --
The chairman of Europe 's leading intergovernmental organization promoting democracy and human rights said Monday that he planned to go ahead with a restricted visit to Chechnya next week despite profound differences with Russia over the conduct of its war and in particular its threat of an attack on Grozny .
Knut Vollebaek , Norway 's foreign minister and current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , said in an interview that he had asked the Russians for a political peacemaking role for the organization , but had initially been rebuffed and barred from the area .
The organization spans Western Europe and the former Soviet bloc countries , and Russia is a member .
On Saturday , the Russian government relented in part and told him he could take a delegation of observers on a two-day trip to Dagestan , Ingushetia and parts of Chechnya under Russian army control .
`` It is important that we look at the humanitarian needs , '' Vollebaek said , `` because if at a later stage we play a political role , it is important to be seen now , being with the people who are suffering . ''
He said that he planned to meet Chechnyans displaced by the fighting and listen to their stories .
`` Even though we might say that this is limited , not the full mandate that I had wanted , I still think it is important , '' he said .
Vollebaek , whose organization has played a leading role in human rights monitoring in Kosovo , also said he wanted to make the point that internal conflicts -- which is how Russia describes its war against Muslim rebels in Chechnya -- cannot be ignored by the OSCE because the war could have an unsettling impact throughout the Caucasus area and into Central Asia .
Civil wars in Central Asia , he said , would be `` something that can be worse than the Balkans . ''
Russia , which has largely prevented international organizations from visiting Chechnya , has also managed to escape official censure of any kind at the United Nations .
The Russian war , with almost daily reports of atrocities against civilians , has not been brought to the Security Council for discussion .
An Eastern European diplomat suggested that there was great reluctance to interfere in a traditional Russian sphere , whatever the situation .
But there is mounting concern among Islamic nations and others that fear the possibility that the Chechnya crisis will become a new crusade for Islamic militants , especially if Grozny is destroyed with significant loss of life .
As of Monday , the city of Grozny , which Russia ordered evacuated ahead of a major offensive , was not on the OSCE delegation 's itinerary .
