The shoot system consists of stems, leaves, and flowers. Leaves are attached by their petioles to the nodes of the stem, with internodes of the stem separating the nodes. Axillary buds, located in the axils of petioles and stems, have the potential to extend as vegetative or floral branches. The two classes of angiosperms, monocots and eudicots, differ in anatomical details.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity35A:<span class="Emphasis1">

Vascular tissues integrate the parts of the plant. Water and minerals move up from roots in the xylem. Sugar is exported from leaves or storage organs in the phloem. Tracheids and vessel elements, the water-conducting cells of xylem, have thick walls and are dead at functional maturity. Sieve-tube members are the sugar-transporting cells of phloem. Though alive at functional maturity, sieve-tube cells depend on the services of neighboring companion cells.</p></LI><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Plant tissues are composed of three basic cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma (pp. 726-728,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 35.10</span>, <span class="SmallCap">35.11</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Parenchyma cells, relatively unspecialized cells that retain the ability to divide, perform most of the plant’s metabolic functions of synthesis and storage. Collenchyma cells, which have unevenly thickened walls, support young, growing parts of the plant. Sclerenchyma cells--fibers, sclereids, and the water-conducting cells of xylem--have thick, lignified walls that help support mature, nongrowing parts of the plant.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">THE PROCESS OF PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Meristems generate cells for new organs throughout the lifetime of a plant: <span class="Emphasis1">an overview of plant growth</span> (pp. 729-730,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 35.12</span>, <span class="SmallCap">35.13</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Apical meristems elongate shoots and roots through primary growth.

These primary meristems give rise to the dermal, vascular, and ground tissues of the primary plant body. In roots, the apical meristem is located near the tip, where it regenerates the root cap as well as producing the primary meristems. The apical meristem of a shoot is located in the terminal bud, where it gives rise to a repetition of internodes and leaf-bearing nodes.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in the Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">
