MANILA , Philippines
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Filipino women protested Sunday against an accord that would bring U.S. forces back to the islands , while U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought assurances from government leaders that the agreement would pass the Senate .
Philippine President Joseph Estrada also received assurances from Keizo Obuchi , the man expected to become Japan 's new prime minister next week , that development assistance would continue and the two countries ' ties would grow closer .
The high-level meetings occurred on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum .
Estrada said he sought Obuchi 's support for his administration 's efforts to improve the lives of impoverished Filipinos in the southern region of Mindanao .
Parts of Mindanao rank among the country 's worst economic backwaters due to a Muslim separatist struggle that has raged for three decades .
One thrust of Japan 's substantial development assistance to the Philippines has been Mindanao , which has also been particularly hard hit by a drought caused by the El Nino weather condition .
Obuchi `` assured me that under his leadership , he will establish a very close relationship with the Philippines , '' Estrada told reporters after meeting the Japanese foreign minister at the presidential palace .
`` Whatever help we will need , he will support . ''
Estrada won the May 11 presidential elections by a wide margin on a pro-poor platform .
In a separate meeting , Albright sought assurances from Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon that the Visiting Forces Agreement , allowing resumption of joint U.S. - Philippine military exercises , would pass the country 's Senate .
Siazon said that was his wish as well as Estrada 's , said a senior U.S. official , who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity .
Meanwhile , about 50 women , carrying placards with anti- U.S .
slogans and yelling , `` Never again ! '' protested outside the steel gates of the seaside Manila Hotel where Albright and Siazon were meeting .
One of the protesters , Janice Monte of the left-wing women 's movement called Gabriela , said that a return of U.S. troops would promote more prostitution of women and children in the country , as when American bases were open north of Manila .
Other left-wing groups have said they would hound Albright with protests until she leaves the country Wednesday .
The proposed accord provides certain legal protections for U.S. troops while in the Philippines , a change that will allow military exercises to resume .
The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996 , when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed here .
Filipino senators voted against a treaty renewing the lease of the last U.S. military base in the Philippines , at Subic Bay , north of Manila , in 1991 .
The base closed a year later , ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in this former American colony .
The two countries used to conduct six to eight military exercises a year , involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time .
