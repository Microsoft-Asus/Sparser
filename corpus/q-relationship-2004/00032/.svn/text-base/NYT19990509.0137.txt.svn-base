WASHINGTON --
Prescription drugs were not a major issue when Medicare was created in 1965 , and thus never included as a benefit .
But 34 years later , medicine has been transformed by new drugs to treat the ills of old age , from osteoporosis to heart disease , and many of the elderly are struggling to pay the bill .
The issue has great and growing power at the grass roots , politicians and health care advocates say , and with the goad of an election just over the horizon , lawmakers in both parties on Capitol Hill are suddenly working on a variety of proposals to do something about it .
The debate will be fully joined in a matter of weeks when the Clinton administration produces its plan to overhaul Medicare , which is expected to propose a major new drug benefit .
Yet there is also widespread agreement that it will be very hard to actually pass legislation on the issue , and not simply because of partisan politics .
Medicare , the federal health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled , already has problems paying for benefits over the long term ; because of that , many politicians say , any expansion of benefits must be tied to a broader restructuring of the program , an extremely divisive prospect .
As Sen. John B. Breaux , the Louisiana Democrat who headed a federal advisory commission that deadlocked over how to restructure Medicare , put it : `` People want the goodies .
They want dessert .
But you 've also got to reform the system to make it work . ''
More than a third of the 39 million people on Medicare have no coverage for prescription drugs they use outside hospitals , and many others with some form of private coverage have substantial out-of-pocket costs .
It was not hard to start a conversation about the issue at the Berkeley Senior Center in Martinsburg , W.Va. , last week .
`` My medicine bill was almost $ 200 last month , '' said Edith Dennison , 82 , a retired millworker who says she pays that bill out of her Social Security check .
Dorothy Baker , a friend who is also 82 , said her bill was more than $ 100 .
Judy Knick pulled out a list of her medications , pointed to one and declared , `` This is the one that kills me -- $ 145 for 30 at the Wal - Mart . ''
Social workers at Berkeley Senior Services , a private , nonprofit agency that operates the center , say they have become expert at getting the low-income elderly onto drug-company programs that provide free medication , and patching together other forms of assistance .
Heather Triplett , a Berkeley outreach worker , said : `` A lot are embarrassed or ashamed to admit that they ca n't afford their prescriptions .
So they go from month to month and never let anyone know what a dire situation they 're in .
Sometimes their kids call us . ''
The cost can be to a patient 's health as well as pocketbook .
Addressing that concern , Roni Mather , a registered nurse , recently gave a talk at the senior center about the importance of patients ' taking medication as directed , and not trying to economize by stopping short when they feel better .
`` Cost really comes into play with our patients , '' Ms. Mather said .
Medicare beneficiaries who do have some drug coverage get it in several ways .
About a fourth of all beneficiaries had coverage through employer-sponsored plans in 1995 , according to the National Academy of Social Insurance , a research group , while less than a tenth bought supplemental Medigap insurance with a drug benefit , which is substantially more expensive than a standard Medigap policy .
The rest of those with coverage are either members of health maintenance organizations that provide drug benefits , or qualify for Medicaid , the insurance program for the poor .
Thirteen states have programs to help the lower-income elderly who are not poor enough for Medicaid .
Medicare does cover prescriptions for its beneficiaries in hospitals .
Besides the third of all Medicare beneficiaries with no drug coverage at all , what worries some analysts are the signs of erosion in private coverage .
The number of large companies offering their retired employees such benefits is declining , according to the administration .
Meanwhile , some health maintenance organizations are putting new limits on how much they will cover for prescription drugs .
Some of the elderly have lost their drug benefits because their health maintenance organizations have pulled out of the Medicare market .
`` I went through a period toward the end of last year when four of the eight HMOs that treat seniors pulled out of my area , '' said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin , D - Md .
`` So I had a town hall meeting and a huge crowd showed up . ''
They were `` panicked , '' he said , over the loss of prescription drug benefits .
With coverage limited , advocates say , the out-of-pocket costs for the elderly are substantial , because of both the rising prices of drugs and the greater use of them .
Spending on outpatient pharmaceuticals this year is expected to average $ 942 per Medicare beneficiary , roughly half paid by insurers and half paid by the beneficiaries , according to the National Academy of Social Insurance .
About 29 percent have out-of-pocket expenses of more than $ 500 a year .
Dr. Jerry Avorn , a geriatrician and expert on drugs at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , said a Medicare patient today might be a woman in her 70s , on medication for osteoporosis , cholesterol , high blood pressure and depression .
`` She could easily end up with bills of three or four thousand dollars a year , primarily to prevent the occurrence of disability in future years , '' Avorn said .
`` In that light , we 're really in a new era of pharmacological therapy for the elderly . ''
In contrast , Avorn said , `` When Medicare was first created back in the ' 60s , our understanding of drugs was quite different .
They were primarily used to treat acute illness and made up a small part of the health care budget .
In the three-plus decades since , medicine has become not just about the treatment of acute disease but about ongoing management of chronic illness , and even more about the lowering of risk status for things like hypertension . ''
As a result , many advocates argue , the lack of prescription drug coverage raises important questions of equity .
The issue has caught fire on Capitol Hill , with both parties promising action .
But the enthusiasm masks the serious difficulties in its path .
Among the biggest questions : Should a new prescription drug benefit cover everyone on Medicare , or just the lower-income ?
How should it be paid for ?
An analysis of five possible drug benefits by the National Academy of Social Insurance showed them adding $ 17 billion to $ 24 billion in the first year to Medicare , whose total spending is about $ 200 billion a year .
-LRB- MORE -RRB- Lawmakers are keenly aware that one of the last major efforts to expand Medicare benefits was disastrous : a 1988 law intended to provide additional coverage for catastrophic illnesses and for prescription drugs that was financed , in part , by a surtax on the elderly .
The backlash was so intense that it was repealed the following year , before the drug benefit even began .
Moreover , all the current maneuvering is taking place in the shadow of the 2000 elections , in which the House , where Republicans have only a thin majority , is considered up for grabs .
Some Republicans suggest that the Democrats are less interested in passing legislation than in creating a campaign issue .
Republican leaders say they will offer a more responsible approach to the problem .
`` Republicans are working on a prescription drug plan for seniors that will not bankrupt Medicare , '' Rep. Bill Thomas , R - Calif .
and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health , said last week .
`` The Democrats ' bill is a poison pill , '' he added .
Add to that some powerful lobbies , notably the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , which is fiercely opposed to any Medicare prescripti plan that would involve government price controls , asserting it would hinder research .
For all of that , many analysts say that sooner or later , the Medicare benefit package must be retrofitted for the changing medical needs of the elderly .
Dr. Christine K. Cassell , chairman of the geriatrics department at Mount Sinai Medical Center , said , `` If you were to look at the current Medicare population , living as long as they do , and say , ` Let 's design a cost-efficient but effective health care plan , ' you 'd do it very differently .
