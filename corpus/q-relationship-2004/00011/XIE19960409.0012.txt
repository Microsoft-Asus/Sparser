TEHRAN , April 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iran announced here today it has smashed a Turkish espionage ring mostly made up of Turkish diplomats in the Islamic Republic .
But the announcement , made by intelligence director general of East Azarbaijan province , did not give the total number of the arrested .
In the announcement , the intelligence director general accused four Turkish diplomats of having links with the espionage ring and conducting spying activities , and the four accused are as follows : Ardal Kuzoghlu , Turkish political attache at the consulate in Orumiyeh ; Khalil Olomoz , political attache at the Turkish Embassy in Tehran ; Ali Hussein Hakan Kadakal , political attache at the Orumiyeh Consulate ; and Qadri Jan , political attache at the consulate in Tabriz .
The intelligence director general , who was not identified by name , said further information on the espionage ring will be put forward to the media and the public in the coming days .
The intelligence officer was quoted as saying that confessions of those arrested and the documents discovered from the spy den indicate that the spies garnered information and put it at the disposal of the Turkish Intelligence Agency .
The official said that the ring conspired against the Islamic Republic of Iran and intended to interfere with Iran 's internal affairs .
They were trying to form clandestine groups in an effort to carry out unlawful operations and acts of sabotage against the sovereignty of Iran .
The report said that the confessions of the members of the espionage ring indicate that a number of Turkish intelligence officers , who were planted under the guise of diplomats at the Turkish embassy in Tehran and its consulates in Tabriz and Orumiyeh , spearheaded these covert activities .
Observers here noted that the latest move taken by the Iranian government would further deteriorate the already-sour relations between Iran and Turkey .
The relations between Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold after the publications of news reports that Turkey and Israel signed a military agreement under which the Israeli air force is permitted to train in the Turkish sky .
Iran has warned against the Turkish government that it would pose threat to the national security of the Islamic Republic .
Iran 's First Vice - President Hassan Habibi said that the presence of foreign forces in the region is not acceptable to the Islamic Republic of Iran .
`` If the news is correct , it is going to hurt the feeling of the Islamic nation , '' Habibi said in a meeting with visiting Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Toygun .
In reply , Toygun said that Ankara attached great importance to its friendly relations with other countries .
It would not allow any country to disrupt its friendly relations with Iran .
According to an Iranian report , the Turkish official denied that his country did not allow Israel to use its airspace and base .
He was quoted by Iranian official news agency IRNA as saying that his country did not intend to create tension in the region , especially with Iran .
In a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati Monday night , Toygun said that the news about allowing Israel use Turkish airspace was `` blown out of proportion by the world media . ''
