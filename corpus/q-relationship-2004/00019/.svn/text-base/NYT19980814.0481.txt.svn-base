PARIS --
France 's conservatives , defeated last year by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin 's Socialists , are reeling again after the party 's latest decision and the reaction it provoked .
The party decided on Thursday to admit as a member Jacques Blanc , president of the assembly for the Languedoc - Roussillon region , who had accepted support from the extreme right to keep his post .
In response , Gilles de Robien , former leader of a conservative umbrella group that supported Jospin 's predecessor , Alain Juppe , snipped his plastic Liberal Democracy party card on a France 3 television broadcast .
`` I have nothing more to do with this family , which has no more republican ideals , '' he said .
Last March , Blanc and two other conservative regional assembly leaders were expelled from the mainstream conservative umbrella group -- the Union for French Democracy -- after they accepted support from the far-right National Front to keep their posts despite conservative losses to the Socialists and other leftist parties in regional elections .
The National Front has called for returning millions of immigrants to their countries of origin .
