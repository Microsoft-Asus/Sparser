WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Pentagon probably will send several hundred soldiers to Nigeria and Ghana to train those West African countries ' soldiers for peacekeeping duty in Sierra Leone , officials said Thursday .
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said no final decision has been made on the number of American troops to be involved , but that a small group of U.S. soldiers now in Nigeria and Ghana are expected to complete an assessment by the end of the week on the assistance those two countries will require .
`` I think it 's reasonable to assume that once they complete their work it would require several hundred U.S. trainers and support personnel to train several battalions in Nigeria , Ghana and maybe another country , '' Bacon said .
In Sierra Leone , guerrillas of the Revolutionary United Front are waging war against government forces and in May kidnapped hundreds of United Nations troops .
In response to the U.N. peacekeeping crisis there , President Clinton pledged $ 20 million to bolster the effort .
The training of Nigerian and Ghanian soldiers is part of that , Bacon said .
Asked about the Pentagon 's announcement , Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said : `` It depends on how long the commitment is .
If it is a limited amount with a good focus , then I 'll be supporters , '' he told reporters while campaigning in California .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , who was traveling with Bush , added that troop deployments under the Clinton administration have suffered from `` a lack of cohesion , a lack of focus . ''
