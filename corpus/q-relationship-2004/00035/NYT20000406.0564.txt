CARACAS , Venezuela --
For helping to engineer the spectacular rise in oil prices over the last year , fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have rewarded him with the group 's presidency .
Now Ali Rodriguez Araque , Venezuela 's minister of energy , faces the daunting task of stabilizing prices at a level that both producers and consumers will find acceptable .
Rodriguez 's sudden emergence as OPEC 's public face is just one sign of the higher profile in international energy affairs that Venezuela is vigorously seeking .
Since President Hugo Chavez took office 14 months ago , this nation of 23 million people , the largest exporter of oil outside the Middle East and the leading supplier to the United States in recent years , has gone from lamb to lion on oil matters .
`` Under this government , Venezuela has been tremendously assertive , showing that we have our own identity and our own way of doing things , '' said Alan J. Viergutz , a former president of the Venezuelan Oil Chamber , the main industry group here .
`` That stands in complete contrast to the previous government , which if not anti- OPEC did not believe in OPEC solidarity . ''
The creation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 40 years ago was in large part the work of Venezuela 's oil minister at the time , Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso .
But throughout most of the last decade Venezuela 's image within the cartel was that of a quota buster whose lack of discipline contributed to low prices for producers and earned the resentment of OPEC 's other , mainly Middle Eastern , members .
`` In 1997 and 1998 , Venezuela 's relationship with other members of OPEC was one of invective , of insults , '' Hector Ciavaldini , president of the state oil company PDVSA , which also owns the American -based Citgo oil company , recalled in an interview with the Venezuelan newsmagazine Primicia .
`` It had ruptured . ''
A month after being sworn in , Chavez , a populist former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt here in 1992 , castigated Venezuela 's previous policy as one of `` inundating the market with no respect for production quotas , without giving any importance to the price of a barrel . ''
He promised `` a profound transformation , '' and was as good as his word , immediately cutting production by 625,000 barrels to 2.7 million barrels a day .
That set off grumbling here that Chavez was favoring his OPEC partners over domestic producers , since the cutbacks led to a recession that is still afflicting the local industry and is likely to inhibit its ability to increase production now .
But the price of Venezuelan oil has nearly quadrupled , to $ 28 a barrel at its peak last month , giving Chavez an economic and political bonanza he has been quick to exploit both here and abroad .
At Chavez 's behest , Rodriguez played a key role in getting non- OPEC producers like Mexico to adhere to the production cuts that originally sent the price of oil skyrocketing .
Then , at their meeting in Vienna last week , OPEC oil ministers adopted a Venezuelan proposal intended to reduce future turmoil in the market by allowing the price of oil to fluctuate only in a `` band '' between $ 22 and $ 28 a barrel .
In the past , the OPEC presidency has often been seen as a post of much prestige but little practical power .
Rodriguez returned from Vienna , however , saying that his fellow oil ministers had granted him the authority to enforce the price band by decreeing production increases or decreases as he saw fit , without convening a meeting of the whole group .
`` If prices fall below $ 22 , we will cut production by 500,000 barrels a day '' to push prices back up , Rodriguez , who did not respond to requests for an interview , explained in a television appearance here this week .
`` When prices are above $ 28 a barrel , we will increase production . ''
The mechanism Rodriguez proposed has yet to be tested , and in the same television appearance he said that he thought `` it will be necessary to have an additional increase in oil production this year '' because `` prices went down , but less than expected '' after the Vienna meeting .
There are also many skeptics who believe that the international oil market is simply too unruly for a price band ever to function effectively .
`` It is going to be very difficult , if not impossible , to micromanage the market , '' said Eduardo Lopez , a Latin American oil specialist at Petroleum Finance Co. , a Washington -based consulting concern .
`` OPEC is not a central bank , and though it has found a new strength , you still have all these countries with a different agenda , and on top of that you have cheating . ''
At first glance , Rodriguez may seem an odd choice to be overseeing the calibration of supply and demand for a commodity that is essential to modern global capitalism .
He was active in a Cuban -inspired guerrilla group in the 1960s and is still a member of a party that is on the far left fringe of Chavez 's coalition .
Eventually , though , he abandoned armed revolutionary struggle and , equipped with a law degree earned in 1961 , entered conventional politics .
It was after being elected to the lower house of the Venezuelan Congress in 1983 that his interest in oil policy blossomed .
He gradually rose to chairman of that body 's energy committee and became a member of the National Energy Council .
`` Ali is entirely the contrary of the image or stereotype you would have of a guerrilla fighter , '' said Viergutz , who is president of an oil investment company and helped develop the oil band concept .
`` He is a very flexible , prudent and open-minded person , and though he may have been a Communist , he has come to see there are other economic systems besides the state-oriented model . ''
Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to punish oil producers for driving up gasoline prices , a move interpreted here as specifically aimed at Venezuela .
OPEC 's decision in Vienna to increase output by 1.7 million barrels a day appears to have headed off an immediate showdown , but even so there are other areas in which conflict between the United States and Venezuela may be looming .
As part of the higher profile in world energy policy it has been seeking , the Chavez government has sought and been granted an OPEC heads of state meeting , scheduled to be held here in September .
Chavez has a tour of the Mideast scheduled for June , and he is expected to personally invite two of Washington 's most bitter enemies , the Libyan leader , Moammar Gadhafi , and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq , to attend the conference .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In addition , the state oil company , acting on Chavez 's orders , has expressed interest in investing in the Cuban oil industry .
If it does , oil analysts here have pointed out , it will almost certainly run afoul of United States legislation that calls for sanctions against foreign companies that make use of American assets nationalized in Cuba without compensation .</ENAMEX>
`` Venezuela has always been a major oil producer and exporter , '' a foreign oil analyst here said .
`` What has changed is that this government is now prepared to use that weight to become a major player on the international scene . ''
