They are mainly bottom-dwelling scavengers, ingesting such food as worms and sick or dead fish. Rows of slime glands on a hagfish’s flanks secrete a gooey substance (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.8</span>). The glands produce small amounts of the slime when a hagfish is feeding, a behavior that may repulse other scavengers. But when a hagfish is attacked by a potential predator, it can secrete enough water-absorbing goo to form several liters of slime in less than a minute. The slime can coat the gills of a predatory fish, sending it into retreat or even suffocating it.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-8','../fig/big/fig34-8.jpg','fig34-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-8.jpg" alt="fig34-8" name="myfig34-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A hagfish.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The skeleton of a hagfish is made entirely of cartilage, a rubbery connective tissue (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 40.2</span>). In addition to the cartilaginous cranium (skull), a strong but flexible rod of cartilage (which is actually the notochord) extends the length of the body, much like the notochords of lancelets (cephalochordates). The hagfish notochord provides support and a skeleton against which muscles can exert force to drive the animal’s serpentine (snakelike) swimming.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Hagfishes do not have vertebrae, and so, as we pointed out earlier, these chordates are only included with vertebrates if we equate the subphylum Vertebrata with the clade marked Craniata in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.1</span>. Until recently, a popular hypothesis was that hagfishes lost their vertebrae secondarily during their descent from an ancestor with a true vertebral column. However, more detailed study has convinced most zoologists that the hagfish skeleton is truly primitive. In fact, hagfishes are now considered to be the most primitive living vertebrates (or craniates), diverging from the vertebrate lineage about 530 million years ago, during the early Cambrian.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
