WASHINGTON --
President Clinton on Thursday sharply eased restrictions on computers that U.S. companies can export to countries like Russia and China , arguing that advances in technology have made ordinary machines just as powerful as the supercomputers of a few years ago .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Clinton 's decision marked a major victory for U.S. computer makers , who lobbied hard for the change so they could export products unfettered by regulations that have given foreign competitors a big advantage in overseas sales</ENAMEX> .
Under the old regulations , exports of machines with high-speed computer chips were restricted because they could be used for military purposes .
But those kinds of chips are now so widely available that they are commonly installed on personal computers sold at computer stores and over the Internet .
While most elements of Clinton 's order go into effect immediately , Congress has six months to review his decision , which will allow the Chinese military -- and military-related groups in the Middle East , India , Pakistan and the former Soviet Union -- to buy computers that are three times more powerful than those allowed under current rules .
With the rule change the administration appeared to be moving to a different philosophy on export controls : It is virtually giving up efforts to control mass-produced computer technology , no matter how powerful .
Instead , it is focusing its export control efforts on the most specialized , high-end machines and software .
`` We need to focus our resources on products that are not widely available , '' John Podesta , the president 's chief of staff , said Thursday .
So far , even some of the harshest critics of the leakage of nuclear technology to China have not objected to the administration 's actions .
The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination , George W. Bush Jr. , was fundraising Thursday in Silicon Valley , among the executives who have pressed hardest for the change .
In a statement released by Bush 's campaign in California , the Texas governor appeared to be in general agreement with the administration position , saying that `` the current system of export controls is broken .
Too often it penalizes our high-tech companies by controlling technology that is widely available from other countries while failing to prevent unique technology from falling into dangerous hands . ''
Clinton , in a statement , said that maintaining the current level of controls `` would hurt U.S. exports without benefiting our national security . ''
His commerce secretary , William Daley , held a Sony Playstation aloft in the White House press room Thursday , and said that unless the export controls were eased , a powerful new version of the popular game machine available this Christmas would be classified as a restricted supercomputer under existing U.S. rules .
The widespread use of high-speed chips in everyday personal computers and games forced the administration 's hand in announcing the liberalization of the rules , the first since 1996 .
But the fact remains that the new regulations will allow U.S. manufacturers to sell computers around the world , without export licenses or government review , that are equally powerful to those used for nuclear weapons design a decade ago .
National security officials said that the kind of machines currently used to simulate nuclear explosions , however , will remain strictly controlled .
`` Our security concerns were heard at every corner , '' the deputy secretary of defense , John Hamre , said Thursday , when pressed on whether America 's commercial interests were trumping its interests in controlling technology that clearly can be used by nations seeking to produce advanced weapons .
But , he added , `` there is no way in which we can control supercomputers , which now are available in the tens of thousands per month or hundreds of thousands per month . ''
Moreover , the definition of a controlled computer or computer chip -- the kind that requires an export license to countries considered a `` proliferation risk '' -- seems likely to change more frequently .
Podesta , said that Washington would now review its export control limits every six months , and raise them if they have become outdated .
Just a month ago , amid the revelations of spying and lax security at Los Alamos National Laboratory , it seemed unlikely that the White House would take the political risk of liberalizing the rules on computer exports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But the chief executives of several high technology firms , from Lewis M. Platt of Hewlett - Packard to Andrew S. Grove , the chairman of Intel , made the case that unless the U.S. rules were relaxed , billions in sales would be lost to European and Japanese manufacturers</ENAMEX> .
`` There comes a moment when a technology is so widely available that the kind of limits that we put in place just a few years ago simply do n't make any sense anymore , '' Platt said during an lobbying trip last month .
The regulation of computers and microprocessors has long been based on a rough measure of their speed : Millions of theoretical operations per second , or MTOPS .
As a benchmark , a fast version of Intel 's Pentium III chip , the standard in many $ 2,000 personal computer systems today , is rated at about 1,300 MTOPS .
New versions of the chip , due out later this year , will top 2,000 MTOPS , and may be connected together in computers that will run at 12,000 MTOPS or faster .
Virtually all computers can be shipped to America 's closest allies -- Western Europe , Japan , Canada , Mexico , Australia and New Zealand -- regardless of their speed .
The White House said Thursday that Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic -- the new members of NATO -- and Brazil will be added to that list .
Tighter restrictions apply to a second class of countries , including most of South America , South Korea , South Africa , and much of Southeast Asia .
Under current rules , companies need to obtain individual export licenses to ship computers that run faster than 10,000 MTOPS to those nations .
But companies have complained that they are losing sales of faster personal computers and `` file servers '' that are commonly found in ordinary offices .
Clinton 's order doubles that limit to 20,000 MTOPS .
The controversy surrounds the third category : nations that are considered `` proliferation risks . ''
They include China , Russia , Vietnam and most Middle Eastern countries .
Under the current rule companies must get individual licenses to ship any computer faster than 2,000 MTOPS to a military user , and faster than 7000 MTOPS for civilian users .
But experts say the distinction is becoming meaningless : There is no way to assure that a fast personal computer sold to a civilian users in China does not make its way into the hands of the military .
Clinton 's proposal is to raise the limit for military users to 6,500 MTOPS , and for civilian users to 12,300 MTOPS .
The latter figure was proposed by the computer industry , which fears that billions of dollars of sales to the Chinese market could be lost if the rules are not changed by year 's end .
