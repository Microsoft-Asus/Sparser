A pipeline across Georgia for transporting Azerbaijan 's Caspian Sea oil to the West will begin operating in April , the head of Azerbaijan 's state oil company said Monday .
The line connecting Azerbaijan 's capital , Baku , and the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa will start pumping oil Apr. 1 , 1999 , Natik Aliev said .
Aliev was in Georgia 's capital Tbilisi for talks with President Eduard Shevardnadze .
Many U.S. oil companies have invested in Caspian projects , and the United States wants the bulk of the crude to flow through a longer , as-yet-unbuilt pipeline across Azerbaijan , Georgia , and Turkey .
Washington thinks that pipeline would bind those countries closer to the West , and make an alternate oil route across Russia and Iran less likely .
A decision on which pipeline will be used for most Caspian oil is expected this month .
Caspian oil reserves are believed to be the largest outside the Middle East , but they remain relatively untapped because countries with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive projects off the ground .
