THE SYNTHESIS OF PROTEIN

 

 Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of a polypeptide: a closer look



 

 Signal peptides target some eukaryotic polypeptides to specific destinations in the cell

 Comparing protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes: a review



 

 Point mutations can affect protein structure and function



 

 What is a gene? revisiting the question



We will now examine more closely how genetic information flows from mRNA to protein--the process of translation. As we did for transcription, we'll concentrate on the basic steps of translation that occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes while pointing out key differences.
