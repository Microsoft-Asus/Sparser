Flowering plants provide nearly all our food. All of our fruit and vegetable crops are angiosperms. Corn, rice, wheat, and the other grains are grass fruits. The endosperm of the grain seeds is the main food source for most of the people of the world and their domesticated animals. We also grow angiosperms for fiber, medications, perfumes, and decoration.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Like other animals, early humans probably collected wild seeds and fruits. Agriculture was gradually developed as humans began sowing seeds and cultivating plants to have a more dependable food source. As they domesticated certain plants, such as the squash represented by the seed in the photo that introduced this chapter, humans began to intervene in plant evolution by selective breeding designed to improve the quantity and quality of the foods the crops produced. Agriculture is a unique kind of evolutionary relationship between plants and animals.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
