GROZNY , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Russian government conducted elections Sunday for a Chechnya deputy to the Russian parliament , but the balloting was criticized by human rights groups and faced wide skepticism among voters in the war-ravaged republic .
The voting was run by the Russian military , which entered Chechnya last September , and no outside election observers were present .
Results were expected Monday .
More than 40 percent of Chechnya 's eligible voters cast ballots , election officials said .
But many Chechens said they would not vote and there was little information available about the 13 candidates .
Some people in Grozny did n't even know the election was going on , while others said they were indifferent .
`` I wo n't vote because I do not know the candidates , '' 28-year -old Adam Beroyev said .
`` Anyway , Moscow will appoint the person it needs . ''
There had been fears of rebel attacks to disrupt the voting , but the capital , Grozny , was reported quiet .
Some 23,000 Russian soldiers permanently based in Chechnya -- 5 percent of the registered voters -- voted earlier , officials said .
Chechen refugees living at a camp in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia also cast ballots .
Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a 1994-96 war , then moved back in last September in a bid to end the republic 's de facto independence and quash what the Kremlin called a breeding ground for terrorists .
Elections for the lower house of parliament were held in the rest of Russia in December , when fighting in Chechnya made it impossible to hold a local election .
Human rights groups claimed the election here would be a farce because parts of Chechnya are still in rebel hands and most areas controlled by Russian forces are n't safe .
Russian troops were on high alert in the republic Sunday , and civilian movement was severely restricted .
Skeptics also criticized having Russian soldiers vote .
They said the election would only sacrifice lives because rebels promised to step up attacks to discourage Chechens from electing a deputy to the lower house , or State Duma .
The Kremlin -appointed civilian leader of Chechnya , Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov , said the election would finally make Chechnya a legitimate part of Russia after years of war .
`` Chechnya will now return to its legal place in Russian political life , '' Kadyrov said , according to Interfax .
On Saturday , rebels attacked a polling station , killing one Russian serviceman and wounding three , military officials said .
An Interior Ministry lieutenant was injured in a separate attack on a polling station overnight Sunday .
Four other servicemen were wounded overnight in grenade attacks in villages , Russian news reports said .
