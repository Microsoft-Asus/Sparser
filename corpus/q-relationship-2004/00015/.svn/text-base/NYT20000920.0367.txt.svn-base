UNITED NATIONS --
Four years after taking control of most of Afghanistan , the Islamic Taliban movement sent a high-level delegation to New York this week to lobby for the country 's seat in the United Nations .
`` We 're here to challenge the United Nations on their reason for not recognizing us , '' the team leader , Deputy Foreign Minister Abdur Rahman Zahid , said in an interview .
`` How can they recognize that band of thugs sitting beyond our borders ? ''
Zahid , taking the Taliban on the diplomatic offensive for the first time , was referring to the mujahedeen , a loose coalition of mostly exiled holy warriors whom the United States once supported in their war against the Soviet Union .
For the last few weeks , in a succession of speeches and meetings affecting Afghanistan here , the mujahedeen have been the sole representatives of a country they no longer rule .
The mujahedeen alliance controls less than 10 percent of Afghanistan .
Its president , Burhanuddin Rabbani , is in exile , and its legacy to the country , U.N. officials say , was the destruction of the capital , Kabul , and much of the nation 's public works in interfactional war .
Throughout the recent summit meeting here , the Taliban have had no opportunity to speak officially , even though they have been excoriated from the General Assembly podium for supporting terrorism , exporting opium and abusing human rights , especially those of women .
Yet the United Nations is the organization , Zahid said , that is trying to teach the Taliban cooperation , tolerance and democracy .
`` This is the world that we live in , '' he said .
`` A government is recognized that does not exist .
Its president does not have an address .
But they have the U.N. seat , all the Afghanistan embassies , everything . ''
The Taliban government -- largely isolated at the behest of Iran , Russia and the United States , if for different reasons -- is recognized by three nations : Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , speaking on Monday at a program sponsored by the White House Project , an organization that supports women in politics , repeated Clinton administration demands that the Taliban agree to a broad -based democratic government .
To the Taliban , that amounts to giving part of the country back to the armed opposition and rekindling the war , Zahid said , adding , `` If the U.N. at least vacated the seat , the opposition would have an incentive to talk . ''
Meanwhile , weapons flow in .
`` We are up to our necks in arms , '' Zahid said .
`` What we need are pencils and books . ''
The Taliban recently banned the cultivation of opium poppies .
Echoing warnings last week from Pino Arlacchi , the top anti-crime official for the United Nations , Zahid said that crop-substitution projects were failing because help in building sugar and cotton mills had not materialized and that the Taliban had no other incentives to offer poppy growers .
Zahid said outsiders often forgot that some opium trade originated in the opposition-controlled areas , where Russian and Central Asian crime figures operate .
Gemstones -- rubies , emeralds and lapis lazuli -- are also smuggled and sold in Europe by the opposition , including diplomats of the defunct government , he said .
Although the Taliban government is not recognized by U.N. members , who will again consider what do with Afghanistan next month , it is treated as the de facto government by U.N. agencies , which run programs there .
Afghanistan is also under Security Council sanctions for refusing to turn over Osama bin Laden , the Saudi -born militant , to American courts .
On human rights , Zahid , who is meeting U.N. officials and other diplomats , said Taliban officials now let women work in health services , the Interior Ministry , at airports and for certain U.N. agencies like the World Food Program .
But he said demands for a representative government and elections were unrealistic in a country destroyed by two decades of war , a drought and almost no foreign aid .
`` How do they expect us to be in a position to hold elections ? ''
Zahid asked .
`` In all of Afghan history , there has never been an election .
After 20 years of war , when we are only beginning to create institutions , when we are the first Afghan government to try to stop opium production , how can they expect us to do this now ?
They are demanding of us what they never before expected of this country . ''
