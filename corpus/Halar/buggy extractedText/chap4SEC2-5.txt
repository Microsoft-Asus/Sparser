 The chemical elements of life: a review

Living matter, as you have learned, consists mainly of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with smaller amounts of sulfur and phosphorus. These elements share the characteristic of forming strong covalent bonds, a quality that is essential in the architecture of complex organic molecules. Of all these elements, carbon is the virtuoso of the covalent bond. The chemical behavior of carbon makes it exceptionally versatile as a building block in molecular architecture: It can form four covalent bonds, link together into intricate molecular skeletons, and join with several other elements. The versatility of carbon makes possible the great diversity of organic molecules, each with special properties that emerge from the unique arrangement of its carbon skeleton and the functional groups appended to that skeleton. At the foundation of all biological diversity lies this variation at the molecular level.

Now that we have examined the basic architectural principles of organic compounds, we can move on to the next chapter, where we will explore the specific structures and functions of the large and complex molecules made by living cells: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
