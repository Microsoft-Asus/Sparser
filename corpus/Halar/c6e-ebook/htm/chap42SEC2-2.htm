A body wall only two cells thick encloses a central gastrovascular cavity, which serves for both digestion and for distribution of substances throughout the body (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.11</span>). The fluid inside the cavity is continuous with the water outside through a single opening; thus, both inner and outer tissue layers are bathed by fluid. Thin branches of the gastrovascular cavity extend into the tentacles of a hydra, and some cnidarians have even more elaborate gastrovascular cavities (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.1</span>). Since digestion begins in the cavity, only the cells of the inner layer have direct access to nutrients, but the nutrients have only a short distance to diffuse to the cells of the outer layer.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-1','../fig/big/fig42-1.jpg','fig42-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-1.jpg" alt="fig42-1" name="myfig42-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Internal transport in the cnidarian <span class="Emphasis1">Aurelia</span>.</span> The mouth leads to an elaborate gastrovascular cavity (shown in blue) that has branches radiating to and from a circular canal.

The flat shape of the body and the branching of the gastrovascular cavity throughout the animal ensure that all cells are bathed by a suitable medium and diffusion distances are short.</p><p class="Header3">Open and Closed Circulatory Systems</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">For animals with many cell layers, gastrovascular cavities are insufficient for internal transport because diffusion distances are too great for adequate exchange of nutrients and wastes. In these more complex animals, two types of circulatory systems that overcome the limitations of diffusion have evolved: open circulatory systems and closed circulatory systems. Both have three basic components: a circulatory fluid (<span class="Emphasis2">blood</span>), a set of tubes (<span class="Emphasis2">blood vessels</span>) through which the blood moves through the body, and a muscular pump (the <span class="Emphasis2">heart</span>). The heart powers circulation by using metabolic energy to elevate the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, which then flows down a pressure gradient through its circuit and then back to the heart. This <span class="Emphasis2">blood pressure</span> is the motive force for fluid movement in the circulatory system.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">In insects, other arthropods, and most mollusks, blood bathes the organs directly in an <span class="Emphasis2">open circulatory system</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.2a</span>). There is no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid, and the general body fluid is more correctly termed <span class="Emphasis2">hemolymph.</span> One or more hearts pump the hemolymph into an interconnected system of <span class="Emphasis2">sinuses,</span> which are spaces surrounding the organs. Here, chemical exchange occurs between the hemolymph and body cells. In insects and other arthropods, the heart is an elongated tube located dorsally. When the heart contracts, it pumps hemolymph through vessels out into sinuses. When the heart relaxes, it draws hemolymph into the circulatory system through pores called ostia. Body movements that squeeze the sinuses help circulate the hemolymph.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-2','../fig/big/fig42-2.jpg','fig42-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-2.jpg" alt="fig42-2" name="myfig42-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Open and closed circulatory systems.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">In a <span class="Emphasis2">closed circulatory system,</span> blood is confined to vessels and is distinct from the interstitial fluid (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.2b</span>). One or more hearts pump blood into large vessels that branch into smaller ones coursing through the organs. Here, materials are exchanged by diffusion between the blood and the interstitial fluid bathing the cells. Earthworms, squids, octopuses, and vertebrates have closed circulatory systems.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
