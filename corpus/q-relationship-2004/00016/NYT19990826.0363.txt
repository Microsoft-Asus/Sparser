ALMATY , Kazakhstan --
The sale of about 40 MiG fighter jets to North Korea has set off a diplomatic furor here , including a possible U.S. threat to cut off aid .
What Kazakhstan officials describe as a rogue group that included senior government officials had already delivered an undisclosed number of the jets to North Korea before the deal was discovered last month and the shipments halted .
The affair has brought down Nurtai Abukayev , head of the State Security Committee , who had been considered one of the most powerful men in the country after President Nursultan Nazarbayev .
In an interview , Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said neither Nazarbayev nor Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev knew of the sale in advance .
Yet the sale , the second such incident this year , has angered some of Kazakhstan 's most important foreign allies and caused the government to appear inept , naive or reckless .
The episode comes at a tense moment in which the United States , Japan and South Korea have protested North Korea 's ostensible plan to test-fire a long-range missile .
Details are sketchy , but diplomats say a Kazakh company agreed to provide North Korea with 30 to 40 MiG -21s , a 1960s-era fighter that is still effective in an arena like the Korean Peninsula .
For the second time in a month , Japan and South Korea have issued diplomatic protests to Kazakhstan , but the government seems particularly worried about a diplomatic breach with the United States , a guarantor of Kazakhstan independence from Russia .
The Clinton administration is reviewing the matter and `` there certainly is the possibility that sanctions may be triggered , '' a U.S. official familiar with the case said in a telephone interview from Washington .
Kazakhstan is scheduled to receive about $ 75 million in much-needed U.S. aid this year , but that money and future funds are in jeopardy because of the sale , the official said .
North Korea is one of seven nations that Washington considers sponsors of terrorism , and U.S. law prescribes sanctions against countries that provide `` lethal military assistance '' to any of them .
The State Department has a range of options , from waiving sanctions entirely to halting all assistance .
In the last publicly disclosed application of such sanctions , in April , three Russian companies were barred for a year from any business with the United States after they sold antitank weapons to Syria .
When the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 , some of its military goods were in republics that eventually became independent nations , and became their property .
While a thriving global arms market has resulted , experts say it has been relatively unusual for the weapons to be sold to nations on the U.S. list of nations that support terrorism .
Four months ago , the Kazakhstan government managed to smooth over a similar incident .
On March 19 , Azerbaijan announced that it had impounded a Russian -registered cargo plane on a flight from Kazakhstan that was carrying six disassembled MiG -21s .
There was confusion as to its destination .
The manifest listed Slovakia .
Kazakh officials said it was headed for the Czech Republic .
Crew members said they were going to North Korea .
Azerbaijan said the jets were headed to Yugoslavia , which is subject to a U.N. embargo and was then being bombed by NATO .
In the end , no conclusion was reached .
`` Maybe they did n't realize the importance of selling these planes , especially to a terrorist country like North Korea , '' a diplomat here said .
`` They do now . ''
