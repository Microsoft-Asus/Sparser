Lawyers charged ahead Wednesday with final arguments in their attempts to 
prove former Cabinet Minister Maurice Papon ordered the arrests that led to 
deportation of 1,690 Jews during World War II .  It was the third day of the 
marathon final arguments of some two dozen lawyers representing of alleged 
victims and their families of the roundups that occurred while Papon was the 
head of the Jewish Affairs Services in the Bordeaux prefecture .  Papon , who 
along with his lawyers will have the chance to speak later this month in the 
war crimes trial , remained silent as the civil party lawyers made their case 
.  `` Maurice Papon is afflicted with the syndrome of the German shepherd : 
always faithful whoever is the master , '' said lawyer Jean-Serge Lorach . 
Papon maintains that he had no major power was just following orders he 
received from his boss , Maurice Sabatier , who was the prefect of Bordeaux 
during the war .  Raymond Blet , another civil party lawyer who spoke 
Wednesday , cast in doubt Papon's claim that he actually helped the French 
resistance during the war .  Papon , who was chief police inspector for the 
Bordeaux region during World War II and later budget minister , is the 
highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy regime to stand trial for 
complicity in crimes against humanity .  He is accused of signing the arrest 
orders that led to the deportation of 1,690 Jews from Bordeaux during World 
War II .  They later died at the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz .  Civil party 
lawyers are to continue making their arguments all this week .  A verdict is 
expected by the end of March .  Papon 's trial is now in its sixth month . 
On Wednesday , seven more civil party lawyers were to address the three 
judges and nine jurors with their final arguments .
