Of these four, genetic drift and natural selection are more important, but we will look at mutation and gene flow as well. We will see that all four of these causes of microevolution represent departures from the conditions required for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (We will not consider departures from the Hardy-Weinberg assumption of random mating; non-random mating can affect the relative frequencies of homozygous versus heterozygous genotypes, but often has no effect on allele frequencies.)</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Natural selection is the only cause of microevolution that generally adapts a population to its environment. The other agents of microevolution may affect populations in positive, negative, or neutral ways. Natural selection always has a positive effect, because selection favors the disproportionate propagation of favorable traits.</p><p class="Header3">Genetic Drift</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Flip a coin 1,000 times, and a result of 700 heads and 300 tails would make you very suspicious about that coin. But flip a coin ten times, and an outcome of seven heads and three tails would seem within reason. The smaller the sample, the greater the chance of deviation from an idealized result--an equal number of heads and tails, in the case of a sample of coin tosses. This deviation from the expected result, due to the sample size being finite in size rather than infinite, is called sampling error.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s apply coin toss logic to a population’s gene pool. If a new generation draws its alleles at random from the previous generation, then the larger the population (the sample size), the more closely the new generation will represent the gene pool of the previous generation. Thus, one requirement for a gene pool to maintain the status quo--Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium--is a large population size (actually infinitely large, an ideal never met). The gene pool of a small population may not be accurately represented in the next generation because of sampling error. It is analogous to the erratic outcome from a small sample of coin tosses.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.4</span> applies this concept of sampling error to a small population of wildflowers. Chance causes the frequencies of the alleles for red (<span class="Emphasis1">R</span>) and white (<span class="Emphasis1">r</span>) flowers to change over the generations. And that change fits our definition of microevolution. This evolutionary mechanism, a change in a population’s allele frequencies due to chance, is called <span class="Emphasis2">genetic drift.</span> Two situations that can shrink populations down to a small size -- small enough for genetic drift to have large effects -- are known as the bottleneck effect and the founder effect.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-4','../fig/big/fig23-4.jpg','fig23-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-4.jpg" alt="fig23-4" name="myfig23-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Genetic drift.</span> This small wildflower population has a stable size of only ten plants.

The small surviving population may not be representative of the original population’s gene pool. By chance, certain alleles will be overrepresented among the survivors. Other alleles will be underrepresented. And some al leles may be eliminated altogether. Genetic drift may continue to change the gene pool for many generations until the population is again large enough for sampling errors to be less significant. The analogy in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.5</span> illustrates why genetic drift due to a drastic reduction in population size is called the <span class="Emphasis2">bottleneck effect.</span></p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-5','../fig/big/fig23-5.jpg','fig23-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-5.jpg" alt="fig23-5" name="myfig23-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The bottleneck effect: an analogy.</span> Shaking just a few of the marbles through the bottleneck is like drastically reducing the size of a population following some environmental disaster. By chance, blue marbles are overrepresented in the new population, and gold marbles are absent. Similarly, bottlenecking a population of organisms tends to reduce variability.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Bottlenecking usually reduces the overall genetic variability in a population because at least some alleles are likely to be lost from the gene pool. An important example of this concept is the potential loss of individual variation, and hence adaptability, in bottlenecked populations of endangered species, such as the cheetah. The fastest of all running animals, cheetahs are magnificent cats that were once widespread in Africa and Asia. Like many African mammals, their numbers fell drastically during the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago. At that time, the species may have suffered a severe bottleneck, possibly as a result of disease, human hunting, and periodic droughts. Some researchers think that the South African cheetah population suffered a second bottleneck during the 19th century when South African farmers hunted the animals to near extinction. Today, only three small populations of cheetahs exist in the wild. Genetic variability in these populations is very low compared to populations of other mammals. In fact, genetic uniformity in cheetahs rivals that of highly inbred varieties of laboratory mice!</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The Founder Effect.</span> Genetic drift is also likely whenever a few individuals from a larger population colonize an isolated island, lake, or some other new habitat. The smaller the sample size, the less the genetic makeup of the colonists will represent the gene pool of the larger population they left. The most extreme case would be the founding of a new population by one pregnant animal or a single plant seed. If the colony is successful, genetic drift will continue to affect the frequency of alleles in the gene pool until the population is large enough for sampling errors from generation to generation to be minimal. Genetic drift in a new colony is known as the <span class="Emphasis2">founder effect.</span></p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">The founder effect probably accounts for the relatively high frequency of certain inherited disorders among human populations established by a small number of colonists. In 1814, 15 people founded a British colony on Tristan da Cunha, a group of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean midway between Africa and South America. Apparently, one of the colonists carried a recessive allele for retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals. Of the 240 descendants who still lived on the island in the late 1960s, four had retinitis pigmentosa, and at least nine others were known to be carriers, based on pedigree analysis. The frequency of this allele is much higher on Tristan da Cunha than in the populations from which the founders came. In addition to inherited diseases, the founder effect also alters the frequencies of many alleles that affect more subtle characteristics.</p><p class="Header3">Natural Selection</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires that all individuals in a population be equal in their ability to survive and produce viable, fertile offspring. This condition is probably never completely met. Populations consist of varied individuals, with some variants leaving more offspring than others. This differential success in reproduction is what Darwin meant by <span class="Emphasis2">natural selection.</span> Selection results in alleles being passed along to the next generation in numbers disproportionate to their relative frequencies in the present generation. One possible cause of such a disproportion might be differential survival. For example, in our imaginary wildflower population, perhaps white flowers (<span class="Emphasis1">rr</span>) are more visible to herbivorous insects, so that more white flowers are eaten. Plants with red flowers (<span class="Emphasis1">RR or Rr</span>) would therefore have more opportunity to produce offspring. Selection can also affect reproductive success more directly. For example, red flowers may be more effective than white ones in attracting the pollinators required for seed production. This difference would disturb Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the frequency of the <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> allele would increase in the gene pool, and the frequency of the <span class="Emphasis1">r</span> allele would decline.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Of all the agents of microevolution that change a gene pool, only selection is likely to adapt a population to its environment. Natural selection accumulates and maintains favorable genotypes in a population.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">Natural selection and genetic drift cause most of the changes in allele frequencies that we observe in evolving populations. However, allele frequencies can also be changed by migration between populations or by mutation, and in some cases these factors are important.</p><p class="Header3">Gene Flow</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">A population may gain or lose alleles by <span class="Emphasis2">gene flow,</span> genetic exchange due to the migration of fertile individuals or gametes between populations. Perhaps, for example, a population near our hypothetical wildflower population consists entirely of white-flowered individuals (<span class="Emphasis1">rr</span>). A windstorm may blow pollen from the <span class="Emphasis1">rr</span> population to our wildflower population, and allele frequencies may change in the next generation.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">Gene flow tends to reduce differences between populations. If it is extensive enough, gene flow can eventually amalgamate neighboring populations into a single population with a common gene pool. As humans began to move about the world more freely, gene flow undoubtedly became an important agent of microevolutionary change in populations that were previously quite isolated (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.6</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-6','../fig/big/fig23-6.jpg','fig23-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-6.jpg" alt="fig23-6" name="myfig23-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Gene flow and human evolution.</span> The migration of people throughout the world is transferring alleles between populations that were once isolated.

A new mutation that is transmitted in gametes can immediately change the gene pool of a population by substituting one allele for another. For any one gene locus, mutation alone does not have much quantitative effect on a large population in a single generation, because a mutation at any given gene locus is a very rare event. If some new allele produced by mutation increases its frequency by a significant amount in a population, it is not because mutation is generating the allele in abundance, but because individuals carrying the mutant allele are producing a disproportionate number of offspring as a result of natural selection or genetic drift.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Although mutations at a particular gene locus are rare, the cumulative impact of mutations at <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> loci can be significant. This is because each individual has thousands of genes, and many populations have thousands or millions of individuals. Certainly over the long term, mutation is, in itself, very important to evolution because it is the original source of the genetic variation that serves as raw material for natural selection.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
