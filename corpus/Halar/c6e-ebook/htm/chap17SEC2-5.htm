In contrast, eukaryotes have three types of RNA polymerase in their nuclei, numbered I, II, and III. The one used for mRNA synthesis is RNA polymerase II. In the discussion of transcription that follows, we start with the features of mRNA synthesis common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and then describe some key differences.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The three stages of transcription, as shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.6</span> and described next, are initiation, elongation, and termination of the RNA chain.

In prokaryotes, the RNA polymerase itself specifically recognizes and binds to the promoter. In eukaryotes, a collection of proteins called <span class="Emphasis2">transcription factors</span> mediate the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription. Only after certain transcription factors are attached to the promoter does the RNA polymerase bind to it. The completed assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bound to the promoter is called a <span class="Emphasis2">transcription initiation complex.</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.7</span> shows the role of transcription factors and a crucial promoter DNA sequence called a <span class="Emphasis2">TATA box</span> in forming the initiation complex.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig17-7','../fig/big/fig17-7.jpg','fig17-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig17-7.jpg" alt="fig17-7" name="myfig17-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 17-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The initiation of transcription at a eukaryotic promoter.</span> In eukaryotic cells, proteins called transcription factors mediate the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase.

Once the polymerase is firmly attached to the promoter DNA, the two DNA strands unwind there, and the enzyme starts transcribing the template strand.</p><p class="Header3">Elongation of the RNA Strand</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">As RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, it continues to untwist the double helix, exposing about 10 to 20 DNA bases at a time for pairing with RNA nucleotides (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.6</span>). The enzyme adds nucleotides to the 3<B>&#39;</B> end of the growing RNA molecule as it continues along the double helix. In the wake of this advancing wave of RNA synthesis, the DNA double helix re-forms and the new RNA molecule peels away from its DNA template. Transcription progresses at a rate of about 60 nucleotides per second in eukaryotes.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">A single gene can be transcribed simultaneously by several molecules of RNA polymerase following each other like trucks in a convoy. A growing strand of RNA trails off from each polymerase, with the length of each new strand reflecting how far along the template the enzyme has traveled from the start point (see FIGURE 17.22). The congregation of many polymerase molecules simultaneously transcribing a single gene increases the amount of mRNA transcribed from it, which helps the cell make the encoded protein in large amounts.</p><p class="Header3">Termination of Transcription</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Transcription proceeds until after the RNA polymerase transcribes a terminator sequence in the DNA. The transcribed terminator--an <span class="Emphasis1">RNA</span> sequence--functions as the actual termination signal. There are several different mechanisms of transcription termination, the details of which are still somewhat murky. In the prokaryotic cell, transcription usually stops right at the end of the termination signal; when the polymerase reaches that point, it releases both the RNA and the DNA. By contrast, in the eukaryotic cell, the polymerase continues for hundreds of nucleotides past the termination signal, which is an AAUAAA sequence in the pre-mRNA (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.8</span>). But then, at a point about 10 to 35 nucleotides past the AAUAAA, the pre-mRNA is cut free from the enzyme. The cleavage site on the RNA is also the site for the addition of a poly(A) tail--one step of RNA processing, our next topic.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig17-8','../fig/big/fig17-8.jpg','fig17-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig17-8.jpg" alt="fig17-8" name="myfig17-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 17-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">RNA processing: addition of the 5<B>&#39;</B> cap and poly(A) tail.</span> Enzymes modify the two ends of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecule.
