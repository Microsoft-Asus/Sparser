Each of the 22 maternal autosomes has a homologous paternal chromosome. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determines whether the person is female (XX) or male (XY). Single, haploid (<span class="Emphasis1">n</span>) sets of chromosomes in ovum and sperm unite during fertilization to form a diploid (2<span class="Emphasis1">n</span>) single-celled zygote, which develops into a multicellular organism by mitosis. At sexual maturity, ovaries and testes (the gonads) produce haploid gametes by meiosis. Sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis in relation to fertilization. Multicellular organisms may be diploid (as in animals), or haploid (as in most fungi), or may alternate between haploid and diploid generations (as in plants).</p></LI><LI><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Meiosis reduces chromosome number from diploid to haploid: <span class="Emphasis1">a closer look</span> (pp. 239-243,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 13.6</span>-<span class="SmallCap">13.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The two cell divisions of meiosis, meiosis I and meiosis II, produce four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis is distinguished from mitosis by the events of meiosis I. In prophase I, replicated homologous chromosomes, each chromosome with two chromatids, undergo synapsis. Nonsister chromatids cross over, exchanging segments (the crossover sites appear as chiasmata). The paired chromosomes (tetrads) align on the metaphase plate, and at anaphase I, the two chromosomes of each homologous pair (not the sister chromatids) move to separate poles. The cell divides, with half the chromosomes going to each daughter cell. Meiosis II separates the sister chromatids, yielding four haploid daughter cells.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity13B:<span class="Emphasis1">
