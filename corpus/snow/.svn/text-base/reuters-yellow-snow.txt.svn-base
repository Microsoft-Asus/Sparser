MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Emergency Ministry planned to fly a
chemical laboratory on Thursday to the Omsk region in southern Siberia
to analyse oily yellow and orange snow which has covered an area home
to 27,000 people. 

"A special mobile chemical laboratory will enable us to carry out
express analysis of the snow at the site," Viktor Beltsov, a spokesman
for the ministry, said. 

The snow covered a 1,500 sq km area with 7,280 homes, Beltsov said.

Omsk is a heavily industrial city with a number of oil and gas refineries.
