TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Thirty activists left Taiwan Tuesday night aboard three fishing boats in a new bid to land on a group of uninhabited East China Sea islands administered by Japan but claimed by China and Taiwan .
They were scheduled to meet and sail to the islands together with 25 protesters from Hong Kong who left that Chinese territory aboard their own boat on Sunday .
Activists briefly attacked four Japanese reporters on the scene while port authorities inspected the boats , but no serious injuries were reported .
Police escorted the reporters away .
The Taiwan contingent is led by Kin Chieh -shou , a local council member from the tiny New Party , which strongly advocates Taiwan 's reunification with China .
New Party lawmaker Lee Ching -hau , a son of former Premier Lee Huan , was among the crowd at Keelung fishing port on Taiwan 's north coast seeing the group off with marching music and chants of `` Long live the Republic of China , '' the Taiwanese government 's formal name .
Funding problems restricted the size of the protest to three boats , the TVBS television network reported .
Previous armadas have boasted up to 31 boats .
The protesters expected to arrive at the Diaoyu islands at around 4 : 30 a.m. -LRB- 2030 GMT -RRB- .
Taiwan and China claim the islands have been theirs for centuries .
Japan first claimed the group in 1895 and has administered them since 1972 .
Kin led a series of expeditions to the islands in 1996 and 1997 , and briefly raised a Taiwanese flag during one landing .
Equipped with wet suits and inflatable rafts , his group staged a rehearsal landing last week at an island just off Taiwan 's north coast .
A Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned in 1996 when Japanese coast guard vessels prevented an expedition he was leading from landing on he islands .
