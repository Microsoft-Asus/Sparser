									<a name="para90"></a><p class="BlockText">During the mitotic cell cycle, the chromosome number doubles and then is restored to its original value by cell division.

Can you think of any advantage to the process as it actually occurs, compared with the alternative? Or do you think they would be equally good ways of organizing the cell cycle?</p>

Why do you think this is true? What kinds of lifestyle changes could we make to help prevent cancer? What kinds of prevention programs could be initiated or strengthened to encourage these changes? What factors might impede such changes and programs?</p>
