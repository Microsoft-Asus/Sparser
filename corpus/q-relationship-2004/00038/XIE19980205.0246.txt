CANBERRA , February 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Australian Prime Minister John Howard Thursday refused to rule out a World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- challenge to a United States export push into Asia which could threaten some of Australia 's key markets .
Howard cited a case in which the U.S. threatened to go to the international trade umpire in an attempt to force Australia to abandon subsidies paid to textiles , clothing and footwear manufacturers as justification for taking a tough stand on the U.S. behavior in Asia .
Since the financial turmoil swept East Asia last year , the U.S. has offered cash-strapped nations such as South Korea and Indonesia billion-dollar credit guarantees in a bid to bolster exports of U.S. agricultural commodities .
Asked in a press conference here whether Australia was considering taking a case to the WTO , Howard told reporters : `` I do n't rule anything out . ''
`` The Americans have not been reluctant to take us to the World Trade Organization , the Americans played hard ball over Howe leather and the Australian government 's first responsibility is to protect the interests of Australian jobs and Australian exporters , '' he said .
In the Howe Leather case , the U.S. complained that subsidies paid to Australian manufacturers of leather upholstery for automobiles discriminated against U.S. companies .
Howard Wednesday accused U.S. exporters of being actively avaricious in trying to steal Australian markets in nations such as Indonesia and South Korea which were still reeling from financial crisis .
He told the news conference that the government was still gathering evidence of the U.S. trade behavior in the region and would assess that information before deciding on a response .
