 Diverse feeding adaptations have evolved among animals

The mechanisms by which animals ingest food are highly varied but fall into four main groups. Many aquatic animals are suspension-feeders that sift small food particles from the water. Clams and oysters, for example, use their gills to trap tiny morsels, which are then swept along with a film of mucus to the mouth by beating cilia. Baleen whales, the largest animals ever to live, are also suspension-feeders. They swim with their mouths agape, straining millions of small animals from huge volumes of water forced through screenlike plates attached to their jaws (FIGURE 41.6).

Fig 41-6. Suspension-feeding: a baleen whale. The humpback whale and other baleen whales use comblike plates suspended from the upper jaw to sift small invertebrates from enormous volumes of water. The whale opens its mouth and fills an expandable oral pouch with water, then closes its mouth and contracts the pouch. This forces water out of the mouth through the baleen, leaving a mouthful of trapped food.

Substrate-feeders live in or on their food source, eating their way through the food. Examples are maggots that burrow into animal carcasses, and leaf miners, which are larvae of various insects that tunnel through the interior of leaves (FIGURE 41.7). Earthworms are also substrate-feeders or, more specifically, deposit-feeders. Eating their way through the dirt, earthworms salvage partially decayed organic material consumed along with soil.

Fluid-feeders make their living by sucking nutrient-rich fluids from a living host (FIGURE 41.8). Mosquitoes and leeches suck blood from animals. Aphids tap the phloem sap of plants (see FIGURE 36.18). Because these fluid-feeding species harm their hosts, they are considered parasites. Hummingbirds and bees, however, are fluid-feeders that benefit their host plants, transferring pollen as they move from flower to flower to obtain nectar.

Most animals are bulk-feeders that eat relatively large pieces of food (FIGURE 41.9). Their adaptations include such diverse utensils as tentacles, pincers, claws, poisonous fangs, and jaws and teeth that kill their prey or tear off pieces of meat or vegetation.

Fig 41-9. Bulk-feeding: a python. Most animals ingest relatively large pieces of food. This is especially true of snakes, which cannot chew their food into pieces and must swallow it whole--even if the prey is much bigger than the diameter of the snake. In this amazing scene, a rock python is beginning to ingest a gazelle it has captured and killed. After swallowing its prey, which may take more than an hour, the snake will spend two weeks or more in a quiet place digesting its meal.
