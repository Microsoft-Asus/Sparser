TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The price of joining the World Trade Organization hit home in Taiwan on Monday , when a popular rice wine was pulled off the shelves and substituted with a wine costing three times as much .
The Bureau of Cigarette and Wine Monopoly suspended sales of michiu , a rice wine used widely in cooking , as part of a package of concessions by Taiwan in its bid to join the body that governs international trade .
But some consumers were furious when they went to the stores and found that michiu , which costs about 72 cents a pint , had been replaced with Fragrant Rice Michiu , which costs $ 2.10 .
`` It is , after all , a cooking wine and the price hike is outrageous , '' said Chang Pi -hua , a mother of two .
Many Taiwanese generously add the wine to popular recipes like stewed chicken , duck and mutton .
Hoping to be accepted as a WTO member sometime this year , Taiwan agreed to gradually increase the price of michiu over five years to $ 5.60 .
WTO members also have demanded that Taiwan impose taxes on liquor based on alcoholic content , regardless of its use , and scrap its liquor monopoly .
The Legislature was expected to consider new liquor taxes proposed last month by the Cabinet sometime before Taiwan 's anticipated entry into WTO later this year .
After the taxes were proposed , angry consumers immediately started hoarding michiu , clearing out the shelves in stores .
The bureau responded by suspending sales Monday .
Responding to concerns that the suspension would result in more people illegally brewing their own wine , bureau head Shih Yen -shiang said Monday that michiu may be placed back on sale next week .
