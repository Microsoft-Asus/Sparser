PARIS --
In the shadows of the war in Kosovo , a ferocious upheaval is reshaping the criminal landscape of Europe .
As NATO bombs and Serbian troops disrupt a Kosovar crime network that has dominated the narcotics trade across the continent , underworld clans from neighboring Albania are making a powerful bid to take over .
They are the real government of Europe 's poorest -- and most lawless -- nation , and by some estimates even more dangerous to the Allied campaign than the tanks and anti-aircraft systems of Yugoslavia .
`` Albania has become the leading country in a wide variety of trafficking , in clandestine immigration , in prostitution .
It ranks as a top exporter of narcotics , '' the nation 's own former president , Sali Berisha , charged in a January speech accusing his successors of corruption and links to criminal syndicates .
`` Until recently , our heroin abusers got their supplies from Kosovars based in Zurich , '' Chief Jean - Bernard Lagger of the Geneva police brigade told investigators from Geopolitical Drug Watch -LRB- OGD -RRB- , Europe 's most respected narcotics surveillance organization .
`` But now , Albanian traffickers have moved into Geneva to deliver drugs to their doorstep . ''
Police officials say that the clans , known as `` fares '' in Albanian , have even begun contesting turf with South American cartels in the European cocaine market .
`` The criminal mentality in certain fares existed before the war , but it was relatively small-time , '' says Michel Koutouzis , senior researcher at OGD and Europe 's leading expert on organized crime in the Balkans .
`` What the Kosovo crisis and the war have done is to elevate that mentality enormously , to push it to a much higher level . ''
The clans have embraced what police officials call the `` Sicilian model '' of criminal organization .
Put simply , this model works on the consolidation of a firm power base at home , with deadly influence on the political structure , from which domestic crime syndicates gradually build international operations .
By the time NATO and hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees arrived in Albania two months ago , the consolidation was well under way .
`` Whole districts and towns are actually under the utter control of the gangs , '' former president Berisha says .
In the countryside surrounding the cities of Vlore and Durres , according to the French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur and other European periodicals , refugee convoys from the war zone have been held up by armed bands in the past two weeks , with young Kosovar women singled out and abducted .
Elsewhere in the country , humanitarian workers and journalists from many Western news services report highly organized war profiteering -- including the diversion of aid shipments into the black market , bribery demands by customs agents processing the shipments in Albanian ports , and gang-run `` taxi firms '' charging as much as $ 120 to transport exhausted refugee families less than eight miles from the Kosovo border to the Albanian town of Kukes .
The normal fee is $ 4 .
An unheated room for aid workers in Kukes today rents for $ 300 per night , in ramshackle houses that sold outright for less than $ 1,000 before the NATO bombings began .
`` It 's like the Klondike during the Gold Rush , '' Albanian journalist Frrok -LRB- CQ -RRB- Cupi told the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche , describing the profits being reaped from foreign military and humanitarian operations .
Men claiming to be sales agents for the national telecommunications company have asked as much as $ 3,000 for the computer card necessary to connect a cellular phone with the satellite network .
`` We should know from experience -- from places like Rwanda and Somalia and Bosnia -- that humanitarian agencies must deal with the local mafias in a war zone , '' says Koutouzis .
`` There is no other way to get to the victims . ''
Those who try to sidestep the clan syndicates do so at their own peril , in a land where the number of illegally owned Kalashnikov automatic assault weapons in some cities is greater than the number of residents .
On April 30 , the Associated Press reported that `` almost every journalist '' who has gone to the refugee camp at Bajram Curri in northern Albania has been robbed , including a team from the Associated Press .
The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe , which oversees the camp , has had two of its official vehicles hijacked by armed men .
The U.S. Army 's Task Force Hawk installation at the Tirana airport , outside the Albanian capital , ranks `` crime '' ahead of `` Yugoslav forces '' among the main threats to American troops in Albania .
Locked inside a hermit country for half a century while the eccentric pseudo- Marxist regime of the late Enver Hoxha prevailed , the Albanian clans did not arrive on the European organized crime scene until the early 1990s , more than a decade after Kosovar drug lords mounted their own successful takeover of the heroin trade .
Albanian crime bosses have made up for their late start with extraordinary aggressiveness and risk-taking , say European law enforcement authorities .
In Germany alone , more than 800 Albanian nationals are currently serving prison sentences for heroin trafficking , a phenomenal number from a country with scarcely 3 million people .
The only larger foreign group in German prisons is from Turkey , which has 20 times the population of Albania and millions of its citizens resident in Germany .
Unhampered by the political struggle that led Kosovar drug bosses to put their empires at risk in a war with Belgrade , Albanian clans have also extended their reach far beyond the drug trade .
As their local power base has solidified , they have rapidly become major players in a dizzying array of criminal enterprises abroad .
Regional clans from southern Albania are believed to have formed an active partnership with the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and its branches in mainland Italy , and emerged as the principal agents and enforcers in sex rings fed by Albanian speedboat fleets that ferry undocumented immigrants across the Adriatic Sea .
In February , a Chronicle reporter found dozens of automobiles with Palermo license plates parked under heavy guard in the gang-infested southern port of Vlore , near waterfront cafes where much of the conversation was in Sicilian dialect .
The police chief of Vlore , Colonel Sokol Kociu , contends that a special high-speed ferry service has even been established to serve Cosa Nostra emissaries traveling back and forth between Sicily and Albania .
Law enforcement officials in Italy say the Cosa Nostra is moving steadily into finance and money-laundering , while the dirty work of international organized crime is subcontracted to others .
There is no mistaking the substantial Albanian presence in this arena .
Of 447 men and women arrested in Italy in 1997 for `` exploitation of prostitutes , '' according to that country 's Ministry of the Interior , 204 were Albanian nationals .
Three months ago , a Milan court indicted 20 Albanian men who were allegedly part of a syndicate that transported 800 unaccompanied Albanian children under age 16 to Italy , where many were forced to beg in the streets under threat of torture .
The speedboats that carried these children west have not been deterred by dozens of Allied warships in the Adriatic .
On a single night during the NATO bombardments of Kosovo and Serbia , April 26 , the contraband fleet dumped 1,200 clandestine emigrants on the beaches of southern Italy .
The violence of the Albanian crime clans has soared exponentially since 1997 , when Albania 's entire financial structure collapsed , throwing the country into chaos .
Riots erupted across the nation .
Army units and meagerly paid police , who earn under $ 100 per month , abandoned their bases and armories .
In the free-for-all that ensued , looters carried off an estimated 2 million pounds of explosives and 750,000 to 1,000,000 Kalashnikov rifles .
The Albanian government says that fewer than 10 percent of the looted weapons have been recovered .
`` Obviously , as long as the arms stores circulating in Albania are n't recovered , a real crackdown on crime there will not be feasible , '' says Italian Interior Minister Rosa Jervolino , who leads Rome 's effort to coordinate law enforcement activities against Albanian -based underworld organizations .
The Albanian legislature , known locally as `` the Kalashnikov Parliament '' because of its members ' ties to weapons dealers , shows little interest in the problem .
The arms windfall provided an important boost to the the KLA in Kosovo , but an even larger one to the narcotics bosses and smugglers of Albania .
`` The same crime groups that traffic in human beings also traffic in drugs and in weapons , '' says Jervolino .
The economic and social effects of their activity -- and the intimidation that often accompanies it -- have been devastating .
`` The number of the Italian investors in Albania is 10 times less than it was in 1996 , '' notes former president Berisha .
`` Thousands and thousands of intellectuals are fleeing Albania only because they feel insecure for their lives and for the lives of their children . ''
Since 1992 , one-fifth of the country 's entire population has abandoned Albania , usually for the grim life of an undocumented alien in Western Europe .
Vlore and its rival northern counterpart , Durres , are also primary stations on Europe 's most extensive stolen car circuit , which doubles as a transport system for narcotics .
Hundreds of late-model luxury cars are parked on the streets .
The cars have usually completed a circuitous journey , with both drivers and vehicles carrying faked papers , crossing through several Western European nations before they enter Albania from Macedonia .
`` At each stage of the journey , the cars deliver drugs and stock up on televisions , video equipment and other household goods , '' the OGD reports .
`` A ` transporter car ' will make only one or two international trips , to avoid identification .
The car is given as a bonus to the courier , who can have its registration changed by making a simple declaration to an Albanian official . ''
In Chronicle interviews three months ago , clan leaders in Vlore openly boasted that two-thirds of all automobiles in the country are stolen .
`` We regard that figure as entirely credible , '' said Lieutenant Domenico DiGianturco of the Guardia di Finanza , Italy 's customs police .
The president of the central bank of Albania made the mistake of taking one of the vehicles on a vacation to Italy in 1996 -- where he was promptly arrested by the Guardia di Finanza and charged with car theft .
Bribery demands by Albania 's own customs officers , a thriving business in `` normal '' times , has boomed with the avalanche of humanitarian aid and military supplies .
The number of trucks disembarking at the port of Durres from Italian ferries has risen by nearly 700 percent in two months , from an average of fewer than 30 per day to more than 200 .
The only way to prevent massive theft , insists Colonel Kociu , Vlore 's beleaguered police commander , is to put the trucks immediately under the protection of a special armed military force as soon the convoys arrive .
Otherwise , he says , `` the aid meant for refugee camps will be diverted onto the black market . ''
Kociu echoes Berisha 's charge that the crime clans are directly linked to political parties in Tirana , and through them wield control over the nation 's ragged customs service .
Although current President Rexhep Mejdani , a former physics professor , is personally regarded as honest , even he concedes that graft and racketeering in his own bureaucracy are out of control .
Reliable sources told The Chronicle that a European Union investigative unit assembled 70 files on customs corruption and turned them over to the Albanian finance ministry in January .
The findings have not yet been made public .
But evidence of the corruption 's scale can be gleaned from a mammoth disparity between declared tax and customs receipts and the consumption of certain import goods in Albania .
In 1998 , reports Tirana journalist Sami Neza , Albanians smoked an estimated 8,000 tons of U.S. and Western European cigarettes .
The total amount officially checked through Albanian customs was 11 tons .
`` There 's a virus that stands in the way of being honest in Albania : the virus of illegality , '' Colonel Kociu says .
`` This virus lives and exists for the wretched interests of politicians .
It is cultivated in the nerve centers of the state , in the customs service , in law enforcement , in the courts .
It 's an epidemic . ''
Two months ago , a four-man official delegation from the Albanian government was prevented by Italian police from boarding a flight to France while the plane was in transit at Milan 's Malpensa airport .
The police were put on guard by discrepancies in one of the men 's diplomatic passports .
The suspicious `` diplomat '' turned out to be Gazmend Mahmutaj -- wanted for murder , and thought by European police to be the Albanian mafia 's `` boss of bosses '' -- traveling under an alias .
His destination was the headquarters of the European Parliament in Strasbourg , where the group was scheduled to participate in the ratification of an International Crime Tribunal treaty .
