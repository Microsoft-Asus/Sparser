It is difficult to imagine that each of us began life as a single cell about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Less than a month after conception, our brains were taking form and our developing hearts had already begun to pulsate (see photograph). It took a total of only about nine months--the length of a school year--to be transfigured from zygote to newborn human, built of billions of differentiated cells organized into specialized tissues and organs.

By combining molecular genetics with classical approaches to embryology, developmental biologists are now beginning to answer many of the questions about how a single fertilized egg cell gives rise to a specific animal. Chapter 21 described some of the recent research, introducing you to a number of basic genetic and cellular mechanisms involved in development. The animals discussed there were mainly invertebrates. In this chapter we concentrate mainly on the embryonic development of animals with backbones.

Molecular biologist Sidney Brenner has wryly commented that developmental biology is about "how to make a mouse," and indeed, mice are favorite experimental models of researchers studying vertebrate development, in particular the development of mammals. Frogs and chickens are also important model organisms for understanding vertebrate development. From the study of these animals and of certain invertebrates (including the ones you met in Chapter 21), scientists have worked out both the stages of embryonic development and many of the cellular and molecular events that underlie them.

Now that we have described the main events of embryonic development in animals, the remainder of the chapter will address the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they occur. Although biologists are far from a full understanding of these mechanisms, several key principles have emerged as fundamental to the development of all animals.





 From egg to organism, an animal's form develops gradually: the concept of epigenesis

The question of how an egg becomes an animal has been asked for centuries. As recently as the 18th century, the prevailing view was that the egg or sperm contains an embryo that is a preformed, miniature infant (FIGURE 47.1). Development was thought to be simply the enlargement of the embryo. This idea of preformation came to include the notion that the embryo must contain all its descendants: a series of successively smaller embryos within embryos, like Russian nesting dolls. One theologian proposed that Eve, in the Garden of Eden, stored all future humanity within her.

Fig 47-1. A "homunculus" inside the head of a human sperm. According to one version of the preformation idea, a sperm contains a preformed, miniature infant, which simply grows in size during embryonic development. This engraving was made in 1694.

The competing theory of embryonic development was epigenesis, originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by Aristotle. According to this idea, the form of an animal emerges gradually from a relatively formless egg. As microscopy improved during the 19th century, biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps, and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favored explanation among embryologists.

Modern biology, of course, has completely discarded the idea of a tiny person living in an egg or sperm cell. But when interpreted in broader terms, the concept of preformation may have some merit. Although an embryo's form emerges gradually as it develops from a fertilized egg, something is preformed in the zygote. As discussed in Chapter 21, an organism's development is largely determined by the genome of the zygote and the organization of the cytoplasm of the egg cell. Messenger RNA, proteins, and other substances made by the mother are heterogeneously distributed in the unfertilized egg, and these substances have a profound effect on the development of the future embryo in most animal species (mammals may be an exception, as we will discuss later). After fertilization produces a zygote, cell division partitions the cytoplasm in such a way that nuclei of different embryonic cells are exposed to different cytoplasmic environments. This sets the stage for the expression of different genes in different cells. As cell division continues and the embryo develops, inherited traits emerge by mechanisms that selectively control gene expression, leading to the differentiation (specialization) of cells. The timely communication of instructions, telling cells precisely what to do when, is essential. This information transfer occurs by cell signaling among different embryonic cells. Along with cell division and differentiation, development involves morphogenesis, the process by which an animal takes shape. Thus, the overall process of development is one of epigenesis.

In the first half of the chapter we will survey the early stages of embryonic development, when the body plan of an animal emerges from the fertilized egg. In the second half of the chapter we will look at the cellular and molecular mechanisms that play major roles in the developmental process. We begin with the fertilization of an egg cell by a sperm.





 Fertilization activates the egg and brings together the nuclei of sperm and egg

The gametes, sperm and egg that unite during fertilization, are both highly specialized cell types produced by a complex series of developmental events in the testes and ovaries of the parents (see Chapter 46). The main function of fertilization is to combine haploid sets of chromosomes from two individuals into a single diploid cell, the zygote. Another key function is activation of the egg: Contact of the sperm with the egg's surface initiates metabolic reactions within the egg that trigger the onset of embryonic development.

Fertilization has been studied most extensively by combining the gametes of sea urchins in the laboratory. Although the details of fertilization vary with different animal groups, sea urchins (phylum Echinodermata) provide a good general model for the important events of fertilization. While sea urchins are not vertebrates or even chordates, they are deuterostomes (see Chapter 32), and their early development is similar to that of vertebrates.

The Acrosomal Reaction

The eggs of sea urchins are fertilized externally after the animals release their gametes into the surrounding seawater. When a sperm cell is exposed to molecules from the slowly dissolving jelly coat that surrounds an egg, a vesicle at the tip of the sperm called the acrosome discharges its contents by exocytosis (FIGURE 47.2, p. 1000). This acrosomal reaction releases hydrolytic enzymes that enable an elongating structure called the acrosomal process to penetrate the jelly coat of the egg. The tip of the acrosomal process is coated with a protein that adheres to specific receptor molecules located under the jelly coat, on the vitelline layer just external to the plasma membrane of the egg. In sea urchins and many other animals, "lock-and-key" recognition of molecules ensures that eggs will be fertilized only by sperm of the same species. This specificity is especially important when fertilization occurs externally in water, where gametes of other species are likely to be present.

Fig 47-2. The acrosomal and cortical reactions during sea urchin fertilization. The events following contact of a single sperm and egg ensure that only one sperm nucleus enters the cytoplasm of the egg.

The acrosomal reaction leads to the fusion of sperm and egg plasma membranes and the entry of a single sperm nucleus into the cytoplasm of the egg. Fusion of the membranes causes ion channels to open in the egg cell's plasma membrane, allowing sodium ions to flow into the egg cell and change the membrane potential, the voltage across the membrane (see Chapter 8, pp. 149-150). This membrane depolarization, as such a change is called, is common among animal species. Occurring within about 1 to 3 seconds after a sperm binds to the vitelline layer, the depolarization is also called the fast block to polyspermy because it prevents more than one sperm cell from fusing with the egg's plasma membrane. Without this block, multiple sperm could fertilize the egg--resulting in an aberrant number of chromosomes in the zygote.

The Cortical Reaction

Another major effect of the fusion of egg and sperm plasma membranes is the cortical reaction, a series of changes in the outer zone (cortex) of the egg cytoplasm (see FIGURE 47.2, step 6). The fusion of sperm and egg triggers a signal-transduction pathway that causes the egg's endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium (Ca2+) into the cytosol. The calcium release from the ER begins at the site of sperm entry and then propagates in a wave across the fertilized egg (FIGURE 47.3). Apparently the signaling pathway leads to production of the "second messengers" IP3 and DAG (see FIGURE 11.15). The IP3 opens ligand-gated calcium channels in the ER membrane; the Ca2+ released then triggers the opening of other channels, and so on. Within seconds, the high concentration of Ca2+ brings about a change in vesicles called cortical granules, which lie just under the egg's plasma membrane. Responding to the Ca2+ increase, the cortical granules fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the perivitelline space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer. Enzymes from the granules separate the vitelline layer from the plasma membrane while mucopolysaccharides produce an osmotic gradient, drawing water into the perivitelline space and swelling it. The swelling pushes the vitelline layer away from the plasma membrane, and other enzymes harden it. The result is that the vitelline layer becomes the fertilization envelope, which resists the entry of additional sperm. By this time, usually about a minute after sperm and egg fuse, the voltage across the plasma membrane has returned to normal, and the fast block to polyspermy no longer functions. But the fertilization envelope, along with other changes in the egg's surface, functions as a slow block to polyspermy.

Fig 47-3. A wave of Ca2+ release during the cortical reaction. A fluorescent dye that glows when it binds free Ca2+ was used in this experiment to track the cortical reaction from the point of sperm contact (0 sec) during the fertilization of a fish egg (LM). The spreading wave of calcium ions, released into the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggers the release of more and more Ca2+. The high cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ causes the cortical granules to fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to formation of the fertilization membrane. The Ca2+ also helps activate metabolic changes inside the fertilized egg.

Activation of the Egg

The sharp rise in the egg's cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ not only triggers the cortical reaction but also incites metabolic changes within the egg cell. The unfertilized egg has a very slow metabolism, but within a few minutes of fertilization, the rates of cellular respiration and protein synthesis increase substantially. With these rapid changes, the egg cell is said to be activated. In sea urchins and many other species, the DAG produced during the cortical reaction activates a membrane protein that transports H+ out of the egg, making the egg cytosol slightly alkaline. This pH change seems to be indirectly responsible for the metabolic responses of the egg to fertilization.

Although the binding and fusion of sperm are triggers for egg activation, sperm cells do not contribute any materials required for activation. Indeed, the unfertilized eggs of many species can be artificially activated by the injection of Ca2+ or by a variety of mildly injurious treatments, such as temperature shock. This artificial activation switches on the metabolic responses of the egg and causes it to begin developing by parthenogenesis (without fertilization by a sperm). It is even possible to artificially activate an egg that has had its own nucleus removed, showing that the molecules involved in activation reside in the cytoplasm. (Of course, embryonic development of such an egg terminates at a very early stage, because the embryo lacks a genome.) The fact that an egg lacking a nucleus can begin making new kinds of proteins upon activation means that mRNA coding for these proteins must be stockpiled in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg.

While the activated egg gears up its metabolism, the nucleus of the sperm cell within the egg starts to swell. After about 20 minutes, the sperm nucleus merges with the egg nucleus, creating the diploid nucleus of the zygote. DNA synthesis begins, and the first cell division occurs in about 90 minutes (in the case of sea urchins and some frogs). The events of fertilization in sea urchins are summarized in FIGURE 47.4.

Fertilization in Mammals

In Chapter 46 you learned how in vitro fertilization of human eggs is enabling some couples with fertility problems to have children. The techniques for test-tube fertilization have also made it possible for developmental biologists to study the process of fertilization in mammals. Many of the events turn out to be similar to what has been observed in sea urchins, but there are also important differences.

In contrast to the external fertilization of sea urchins and most other marine invertebrates, fertilization in terrestrial animals, including mammals, is generally internal. Secretions in the mammalian female reproductive tract alter certain molecules on the surface of sperm cells that have been deposited during the male's ejaculation and also increase the motility of the sperm. This enhancement of sperm function in the female reproductive tract, called capacitation, requires about 6 hours in humans (FIGURE 47.5).

Fig 47-5. Fertilization in mammals. 
			  
		 The sperm migrates through the coat of follicle cells and binds to receptor molecules in the zona pellucida of the egg. (Receptor molecules are not shown here.) 
			  
		 This binding induces the acrosomal reaction, in which the sperm releases hydrolytic enzymes into the zona pellucida. 
			  
		 With the help of these enzymes, the sperm reaches the plasma membrane of the egg, and membrane proteins of the sperm bind to receptors on the egg membrane. 
			  
		 The plasma membranes fuse, making it possible for the contents of the sperm cell to enter the egg. 
			  
		 Enzymes released during the egg's cortical reaction harden the zona pellucida, which now functions as a block to polyspermy.

The mammalian egg (actually a secondary oocyte at this stage; see FIGURE 46.13) is cloaked by follicle cells that were released with the egg during ovulation. A capacitated sperm cell must migrate through this layer of follicle cells before it reaches the zona pellucida, the extracellular matrix of the egg. The zona pellucida consists of three different glycoproteins forming filaments that are cross-linked in a three-dimensional network. One of the glycoproteins, ZP3, also functions as a sperm receptor, binding to a complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head. The binding of the sperm head to receptor molecules induces the acrosome of the sperm cell to release its contents in an acrosomal reaction similar to that of sea urchin sperm. Protein-digesting enzymes and other hydrolases spilled from the acrosome enable the sperm cell to penetrate the zona pellucida and reach the plasma membrane of the egg. The acrosomal reaction also exposes a protein in the sperm membrane that binds and fuses with the egg membrane.

The binding of a sperm cell to the egg triggers depolarization of the egg membrane, which functions as a fast block to polyspermy, as in sea urchin fertilization. A cortical reaction, in which granules in the cortex of the egg release their contents to the outside of the cell via exocytosis, also occurs. Enzymes released from the cortical granules catalyze alterations of the zona pellucida, which then functions as the slow block to polyspermy.

Fingerlike extensions of the egg cell, called microvilli, take the whole sperm cell, tail and all, into the egg. The basal body of the sperm's flagellum divides and forms two centrosomes (with centrioles) in the zygote. These will generate the mitotic spindle for cell division; unfertilized mammalian eggs have no centrosomes of their own.

In contrast to sea urchin fertilization, the haploid nuclei of sperm and egg do not fuse immediately in mammals. Instead, the envelopes of both nuclei disperse, and the chromosomes from the two gametes share a common spindle apparatus during the first mitotic division of the zygote. Thus, it is not until after this first division, as diploid nuclei form in the two daughter cells, that the chromosomes from the two parents come together in common nuclei to form the genome of the offspring.





 Cleavage partitions the zygote into many smaller cells

Fertilization is followed by three successive stages that begin to build the animal's body. First, a special type of cell division, called cleavage, creates a multicellular embryo, the blastula, from the zygote. The second stage, gastrulation, produces a three-layered embryo called the gastrula. The third stage, called organogenesis, generates rudimentary organs from which adult structures grow.

Cleavage is a succession of rapid cell divisions that follow fertilization (FIGURE 47.6). During cleavage, the cells undergo the S (DNA synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases of the cell cycle but often virtually skip the G1 and G2 phases (see FIGURE 12.4). The embryo does not enlarge during this period of development. Cleavage simply partitions the cytoplasm of one large cell, the zygote, into many smaller cells called blastomeres, each with its own nucleus. Thus, different regions of cytoplasm present in the original undivided egg cell end up in separate blastomeres. And because the regions may contain different cytoplasmic components, the partitioning sets the stage for subsequent developmental events.

Fig 47-6. Cleavage in an echinoderm (sea urchin) embryo. Cleavage is a series of cell divisions that transform the zygote into a ball of much smaller cells, called blastomeres (LMs).(a) The two-cell stage, following the first cleavage division, occurs about 45-90 minutes after fertilization. Notice that the fertilization envelope is still present. (b) The second cleavage division produces the four-cell stage. (c) In a few hours, further cleavage divisions have formed a multicellular ball. The embryo is still inside the fertilization envelope, from which the larva will eventually hatch.

With the apparent exception of mammals, most animals have both eggs and zygotes with a definite polarity. During cleavage in such organisms, the planes of division follow a specific pattern relative to the poles of the zygote. The polarity is defined by the heterogeneous distribution of substances in the cytoplasm, including specific mRNA and proteins, and yolk (stored nutrients). In many frogs and other animals, the distribution of yolk is a key factor in influencing the pattern of cleavage. Yolk is most concentrated at one pole of the egg, called the vegetal pole, while the opposite pole, the animal pole, has the lowest concentration of yolk. The animal pole is also the site where the polar bodies of oogenesis are budded from the cell (see FIGURE 46.13), and in some animals it marks the point where the anterior (head) end of the embryo will form.

The hemispheres of the zygote are named for their respective poles (FIGURE 47.7). In the eggs of many frogs, the animal and vegetal hemispheres have different coloration due to the heterogeneous distribution of cytoplasmic substances. The animal hemisphere has melanin granules embedded in the outer layer of the cytoplasm (the cortex), giving it a deep gray hue, while the vegetal hemisphere contains the yellow yolk. A rearrangement of the amphibian egg cytoplasm occurs at the time of fertilization. The plasma membrane and associated cortex rotate toward the point of sperm entry, probably because the centrosome brought into the egg by the sperm cell reorganizes the cytoskeleton. The rotation exposes a light-gray region of cytoplasm, a band called the gray crescent. Located near the equator of the egg on the side opposite the sperm entry, the gray crescent is an important early marker of the polarity of the amphibian egg: It corresponds to the dorsal side of the later embryo.

Fig 47-7. The establishment of the body axes and the first cleavage plane in an amphibian. The "animal" hemisphere of the egg, which will become the anterior end of the embryo, is dark gray due to melanin in its outer cytoplasm (cortex); the "vegetal" hemisphere is yellow because it contains the yolk. At fertilization, the pigmented cortex slides over the underlying cytoplasm toward the point of sperm entry, exposing a region of lighter-colored cytoplasm. The exposed region, known as the gray crescent, is opposite the point of sperm entry. The first cleavage division bisects the gray crescent. The crescent marks the location of the dorsal side of the future embryo. Thus, all three axes of the embryo are established before the zygote begins cleavage.

Because yolk tends to impede cell division, cleavage of the frog zygote occurs more rapidly in the animal hemisphere than in the vegetal hemisphere, resulting in an embryo with different-sized cells. In comparison with frog eggs, those of sea urchins and many other animals have less yolk but still have an animal-vegetal axis, owing to differential distribution of other substances. Without the restraint imposed by yolk, their cleavage divisions all occur at about the same rate, producing blastomeres of virtually equal size.

In both sea urchins and frogs, the first two cleavage divisions are meridional (vertical), resulting in four cells that each extend from animal to vegetal pole. The third division is equatorial (horizontal), producing an eight-celled embryo with two tiers of four cells each (FIGURE 47.8a). The general pattern up to this point is the same in both types of embryos. In fact, echinoderms, chordates, and the other animal phyla grouped as deuterostomes share many features of early embryonic development. These similarities help distinguish the deuterostomes from the protostomes, such as mollusks, annelids, and arthropods (see FIGURE 32.7).

Fig 47-8. Cleavage in a frog embryo. Yolk, concentrated near the vegetal pole of the egg, slows down the formation of cleavage furrows in the vegetal hemisphere. (a, b, and c are SEMs.)

Continued cleavage produces a solid ball of cells known as the morula, Latin for "mulberry," in reference to the lobed surface of the embryo at this stage (FIGURE 47.8b). A fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel forms within the morula, creating a hollow ball called the blastula (FIGURE 47.8c). In sea urchins, the blastocoel is centrally located in the blastula. However, in frogs, because of unequal cell division, the blastocoel is located in the animal hemisphere (FIGURE 47.8d).

Yolk is most plentiful and has its most pronounced effect on cleavage in the eggs of birds, reptiles, many fishes, and insects. In birds, for example, the part of the egg we commonly call the yolk is actually the egg cell (ovum), swollen with yolk nutrients. This enormous cell is surrounded by a protein-rich solution (the egg white) that will provide additional nutrients for the growing embryo. Cleavage of the fertilized egg is restricted to a small disc of yolk-free cytoplasm at the animal pole of the egg cell. This incomplete division of a yolk-rich egg is known as meroblastic cleavage. It contrasts with holoblastic cleavage, the complete division of eggs having little yolk (as in sea urchins) or a moderate amount of yolk (as in frogs).

The yolk-rich eggs of insects, such as Drosophila, undergo a unique type of meroblastic cleavage (see FIGURE 21.11). The zygote's nucleus is situated within a mass of yolk. Cleavage begins with the nucleus undergoing mitotic divisions that are not accompanied by cytokinesis. These mitotic divisions produce several hundred nuclei, which migrate to the outer edge of the egg. After several more rounds of mitosis, a plasma membrane forms around each nucleus, and the embryo, now a blastula, consists of a single layer of about 6,000 cells surrounding a mass of yolk.





 Gastrulation rearranges the blastula to form a three-layered embryo with a primitive gut

The morphogenetic process called gastrulation is a dramatic rearrangement of the cells of the blastula. Gastrulation differs in detail from one animal group to another, but a common set of cellular changes drives this spatial rearrangement of an embryo. These general cellular mechanisms are changes in cell motility, changes in cell shape, and changes in cellular adhesion to other cells and to molecules of the extracellular matrix (see FIGURE 7.29). The result of gastrulation is that some of the cells at or near the surface of the blastula move to an interior location, and three cell layers are established. The three-layered embryo is called the gastrula. The positioning of the cell layers in the gastrula allows cells to interact with each other in new ways.

The three layers produced by gastrulation are embryonic tissues called ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, also collectively termed the embryonic germ layers. The ectoderm forms the outer layer of the gastrula; the endoderm lines the embryonic digestive tract; and the mesoderm partly fills the space between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Eventually, these three cell layers develop into all the parts of the adult animal. For instance, our nervous system and the outer layer (epidermis) of our skin come from ectoderm; the innermost lining of our digestive tract and associated organs, such as the liver and pancreas, arise from endoderm; and most other organs and tissues, such as the kidney, heart, muscles, and the inner layer of our skin (dermis), develop largely from mesoderm.

Let's examine gastrulation in a sea urchin embryo (FIGURE 47.9). The wall of the sea urchin blastula consists of a single layer of cells. Gastrulation begins at the vegetal pole where individual cells detach from the blastula wall and enter the blastocoel as migratory cells called mesenchyme cells. The remaining cells flatten slightly to form a vegetal plate that buckles inward, a process called invagination. The buckled vegetal plate then undergoes extensive rearrangement of its cells, a process that transforms the shallow invagination into a deeper, narrower pouch called the archenteron, or primitive gut. The open end of the archenteron, which will become the anus, is called the blastopore. A second opening forms at the other end of the archenteron, forming the mouth end of what is now a rudimentary digestive tube. Gastrulation has produced an embryo with a primitive gut and three germ layers: ectoderm (color-coded blue throughout this chapter), endoderm (yellow), and mesoderm (red). Thus, the triploblastic (three-layered) body plan characteristic of most animal phyla is established very early in development (see FIGURE 32.6). In the sea urchin, the gastrula eventually develops into a ciliated larva that drifts near the ocean surface as plankton, feeding on bacteria and unicellular algae.

Fig 47-9. Sea urchin gastrulation. 
			  
		 Formed by cleavage, the blastula consists of a single layer of ciliated cells surrounding the blastocoel. Gastrulation begins with the migration of mesenchyme cells from the flattened "vegetal plate" into the blastocoel. 
			  
		 The vegetal plate in this early gastrula invaginates (buckles inward). Mesenchyme cells begin to form thin extensions (filopodia). 
			  
		 Endoderm cells form the archenteron (future digestive tube). Mesenchyme cells form filopodial connections between the tip of the archenteron and the ectoderm cells of the blastocoel wall (inset, LM). 
			  
		 Contraction of the filopodia in a late gastrula drags the archenteron the rest of the way across the blastocoel, where the endoderm of the archenteron will fuse with ectoderm of the blastocoel wall. 
			  
		 Gastrulation is complete. The gastrula has a functional digestive tube formed from the endoderm of the archenteron, with a mouth and an anus. Ectoderm forms the embryo's ciliated outer surface. Some of the mesenchyme cells of the mesoderm have secreted calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which will form a simple internal skeleton.

Gastrulation during frog development also produces a three-layered embryo with an archenteron, as shown in FIGURE 47.10. The mechanics of gastrulation are more complicated in a frog, however, because of the large, yolk-laden cells of the vegetal hemisphere, and because the wall of the blastula is more than one cell thick in most species. The first sign of gastrulation is a small crease on one side of the blastula caused by the invagination of a group of cells there. This invagination becomes the dorsal side of the blastopore, called the dorsal lip of the blastopore. The dorsal lip of the blastopore forms where the gray crescent was located in the zygote (see FIGURE 47.7). Successive invaginations of groups of cells near the dorsal lip result in the completion of the circular blastopore.

Fig 47-10. Gastrulation in a frog embryo.

Frog gastrulation continues with cells on the surface of the embryo rolling over the edge of the dorsal lip into the interior of the embryo, a process called involution. Once inside the embryo, these cells move away from the blastopore along the roof of the blastocoel. Involution continues, with migrating internal cells becoming organized into layered mesoderm and endoderm, and the archenteron forming within the endoderm. Eventually, the complex cell movements of gastrulation produce a three-layered embryo. As the process is completed, the circular lip of the blastopore encircles a yolk plug consisting of large, food-laden cells; these protruding cells will move inward as expansion of the ectoderm causes the blastopore to shrink. At this point, the cells remaining on the surface make up the ectoderm, surrounding the layers of mesoderm and endoderm. With the three germ layers in place, gastrulation is complete, and the embryo's organs begin to form.





 In organogenesis, the organs of the animal body form from the three embryonic germ layers

Various regions of the three germ layers develop into the rudiments of organs during the process of organogenesis (TABLE 47.1). Three kinds of morphogenetic changes--folds, splits, and dense clustering (condensation) of cells--are the first evidence of organ building. The organs that begin to take shape first in the embryos of frogs and other chordates are the neural tube and notochord, the skeletal rod characteristic of all chordate embryos (see FIGURE 34.6).

Table 47-1. Derivatives of the Three Embryonic Germ Layers in Vertebrates

Germ LayerOrgans and Tissues in the AdultEctodermEpidermis of skin and its derivatives (e.g., skin glands, nails); epithelial lining of mouth and rectum; sense receptors in epidermis; cornea and lens of eye; nervous system; adrenal medulla; tooth enamel; epithelium of pineal and pituitary glands.EndodermEpithelial lining of digestive tract (except mouth and rectum); epithelial lining of respiratory system; liver; pancreas; thyroid; parathyroids; thymus; lining of urethra, urinary bladder, and reproductive system.MesodermNotochord; skeletal system; muscular system; circulatory and lymphatic systems; excretory system; reproductive system (except germ cells, which start to differentiate during cleavage); dermis of skin; lining of body cavity; adrenal cortex.FIGURE 47.11 on page 1008 shows early organogenesis as it occurs in a frog. The notochord is formed from dorsal mesoderm that condenses just above the archenteron, and the neural tube originates as a plate of dorsal ectoderm just above the developing notochord. The neural plate soon folds inward, rolling itself into the neural tube, which will become the central nervous system--the brain and spinal cord. These organs are hollow in most chordates because of this mechanism of development. In frogs the notochord elongates and stretches the embryo along its anterior-posterior axis. Later, the notochord will function as a core around which mesodermal cells gather and form the vertebrae. Parts of the notochord between the vertebrae persist as the vertebral discs in adults. (These are the discs that can "slip," causing back pain.)

Fig 47-11. Organogenesis in a frog embryo.

Other condensations occur in strips of mesoderm lateral to the notochord, which separate into blocks called somites. The somites are arranged serially on both sides along the length of the notochord (FIGURE 47.11c). Cells from the somites not only give rise to the vertebrae of the backbone, they also form the muscles associated with the axial skeleton. This serial origin of the axial skeleton and muscles reinforces the point made in Chapter 34 that chordates are basically segmented animals, although the segmentation becomes less obvious later in development. (There are signs of segmentation even in the adult, as in the series of vertebrae in a human or the segments of chevron-shaped muscles in a fish.) Lateral to the somites, the mesoderm splits into two layers that form the lining of the body cavity, or coelom.

As organogenesis progresses, morphogenesis and cellular differentiation continue to refine the organs that arise from the three embryonic germ layers. Review TABLE 47.1, which lists the embryonic sources of the major organs and tissues in frogs and other vertebrates. Unique to vertebrate embryos, a band of cells called the neural crest develops along the border where the neural tube pinches off from the ectoderm. Cells of the neural crest subsequently migrate to various parts of the embryo, forming pigment cells of the skin, some of the bones and muscles of the skull, the teeth, the medulla of the adrenal glands, and peripheral components of the nervous system, such as sensory and sympathetic ganglia.

Embryonic development of the frog leads to a larval stage, the tadpole, which hatches from the jelly coat that originally cloaked the egg. Later, metamorphosis will transform the frog from the aquatic, herbivorous tadpole to the terrestrial, carnivorous adult.





 Amniote embryos develop in a fluid-filled sac within a shell or uterus

All vertebrate embryos require an aqueous environment for development. In the case of fish and amphibians, the egg is laid in the surrounding sea or pond and needs no special water-filled enclosure. The movement of vertebrate animals onto land required solving the problem of reproduction in dry environments, and two major solutions evolved: the shelled egg of reptiles and birds and the uterus of placental mammals. Within the shell or uterus, the embryos of birds, reptiles, and mammals are surrounded by fluid within a sac formed by a membrane called the amnion. Vertebrates of these three classes are therefore called amniotes (see Chapter 34). We have already examined the embryonic development of a vertebrate that lacks an amnion, the frog. For comparison, we now study the early development of two amniotes, a bird and a mammal.

Avian Development

After fertilization, a bird egg undergoes meroblastic cleavage in which cell division occurs only in a small region of yolk-free cytoplasm atop the large mass of yolk. The early cleavage divisions produce a cap of cells called the blastodisc, which rests on the undivided yolk. The blastomeres then sort into upper and lower layers, the epiblast and hypoblast (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). The cavity between these two layers is the avian version of the blastocoel, and this embryonic stage is the avian equivalent of the blastula, although its form is different from the hollow ball of an early frog embryo.

Fig 47-12. Cleavage, gastrulation, and early organogenesis in a chick embryo.

Gastrulation, as in the frog embryo, involves cells moving from the surface of the embryo to an interior location. In birds, however, the route of this cell migration is very different (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). Some cells of the upper cell layer (epiblast) move toward the midline of the blastodisc, then detach and move inward toward the yolk. The medial movement on the surface and the inward movement of cells at the blastodisc's midline produce a groove called the primitive streak. As the streak lengthens over the surface of the blastodisc, it marks what will become the bird's anterior-posterior axis. The primitive streak is functionally equivalent to the frog blastopore, but it is a linear tuck rather than a ring.

All the cells that will form the embryo come from the epiblast. Some of the epiblast cells that pass through the primitive streak move laterally into the blastocoel, producing the mesoderm. Other epiblast cells, which will produce the endoderm, migrate through the streak and downward, pushing out the cells of the hypoblast. The epiblast cells that remain on the surface give rise to the ectoderm. Although the hypoblast contributes no cells to the embryo, it seems to help direct the formation of the primitive streak before the onset of gastrulation and is required for normal development. The hypoblast cells later segregate from the endoderm and eventually form portions of a sac surrounding the yolk and a stalk connecting the yolk mass to the embryo. After the three germ layers are formed, the borders of the embryonic disc fold downward and come together, pinching the embryo into a three-layered tube joined at midbody to the yolk (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). Neural tube formation, development of the notochord and somites, and other events in organogenesis occur much as in the frog embryo. FIGURE 47.13 (p. 1010) shows some of the organs in a 2-day-old chick embryo.

Notice in FIGURE 47.12, step 3, that only part of each germ layer contributes to the embryo itself (which is the protrusion that arises from the blastodisc). The tissue layers that are outside the embryo proper develop into four extraembryonic membranes that support further embryonic development within the egg. These four "membranes," each a sheet of cells, are the yolk sac, the amnion, the chorion, and the allantois. The diagram in FIGURE 47.14 shows these membranes for a developing chick, and the legend describes the functions of each membrane.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 47-14. The development of extraembryonic membranes in a chick. The four major membranes (labeled in bold type) provide support services for the embryo. Each is a sheet of cells that develops from epithelial sheets external to the embryo proper. The yolk sac expands over the surface of the yolk mass. Cells of the yolk sac will digest yolk, and blood vessels that develop within the membrane will carry nutrients into the embryo. Lateral folds of extraembryonic tissue extend over the top of the embryo and fuse to form two more membranes, the amnion and the chorion, which are separated by an extraembryonic extension of the coelom. The amnion encloses the embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic sac, protecting the embryo from drying out, and it, along with the chorion, cushions the embryo against mechanical shocks. The fourth membrane, the allantois, originates as an outpocketing of the embryo's hindgut. The allantois is a sac that extends into the extraembryonic coelom. It functions as a disposal sac for uric acid, the insoluble nitrogenous waste of the embryo. As the allantois expands, it presses the chorion against the vitelline membrane, the inner lining of the eggshell. Together, the allantois and chorion form a respiratory organ for the embryo. Blood vessels that form in the epithelium of the allantois transport oxygen to the embryo. The extraembryonic membranes of reptiles and birds are adaptations associated with the special problems of development on land.

Mammalian Development

In most mammalian species, fertilization takes place in the oviduct, and the earliest stages of development occur while the embryo completes its journey down the oviduct to the uterus (see Chapter 46). In contrast to the large, yolky eggs of birds and reptiles, the egg of a placental mammal is quite small, storing little in the way of food reserves. As already mentioned, the mammalian egg and zygote do not exhibit any obvious polarity with respect to the contents of the cytoplasm, and cleavage of the yolk-lacking zygote is holoblastic. However, mammalian gastrulation and early organogenesis follow a pattern similar to that of birds and reptiles. (Recall from Chapter 34 that mammals descended from reptilian stock during the early Mesozoic era.)

Cleavage is relatively slow in mammals. In the case of humans, the first division is complete about 36 hours after fertilization, the second division at about 60 hours, and the third division at about 72 hours. The blastomeres are equal in size. An important event during early mammalian development is the process of compaction, which occurs at the eight-cell stage. Before compaction, the cells of the early embryo are loosely packed; after compaction the cells tightly adhere to one another. Compaction involves the production of new proteins on the surface of the cells, including proteins called cadherins (discussed later in the chapter).

Further development of the human embryo is shown in FIGURE 47.15. 
			  
		 By about 7 days after fertilization, the embryo has over 100 cells arranged around a central cavity. This is the embryonic stage known as the blastocyst. Protruding into one end of the blastocyst cavity is a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass, which will subsequently develop into the embryo proper and some of the extraembryonic membranes. The outer epithelium surrounding the cavity is the trophoblast, which, along with mesodermal tissue, will form the fetal portion of the placenta. The embryo reaches the uterus by the blastocyst stage and soon begins to implant in the uterine lining (endometrium).


			  
		 The trophoblast initiates implantation by secreting enzymes that enable the blastocyst to penetrate the endometrium. Bathed in blood spilled from eroded capillaries in the endometrium, the trophoblast thickens and extends fingerlike projections into the surrounding maternal tissue. (The placenta will later form from this proliferated trophoblast and the region of endometrium it invades; see FIGURE 46.17.) Around the time of implantation, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst forms a flat disc with an upper layer of cells, the epiblast, and a lower layer, the hypoblast. These layers are homologous to those of birds, and, as in birds, the embryo will develop almost entirely from epiblast cells, while the hypoblast cells will form the yolk sac.


			  
		Now the extraembryonic membranes begin to develop. The trophoblast is giving rise to the chorion and continues to expand into the endometrium. The epiblast has begun to form the amnion, surrounding a fluid-filled cavity. Mesodermal cells that will become part of the placenta are also derived from the epiblast.


			  
		Gastrulation occurs by the inward movement of cells from the epiblast through a primitive streak to form mesoderm and endoderm, just as it does in the chick. We now have a three-layered embryo surrounded by proliferating extraembryonic mesoderm. Four extraembryonic membranes have formed, which are homologous to those of reptiles and birds. The chorion, which develops from the trophoblast, completely surrounds the embryo and the other extraembryonic membranes. The amnion begins as a dome above the proliferating epiblast and will eventually enclose the embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic cavity. (The fluid from this cavity is the "water" expelled from the vagina of the mother when the amnion breaks just prior to childbirth.) Below the developing embryo proper, the yolk sac encloses another fluid-filled cavity. Although this cavity contains no yolk, the membrane that surrounds it is given the same name as the homologous membrane in birds and reptiles. The yolk sac membrane of mammals is a site of early formation of blood cells, which later migrate into the embryo proper. The fourth extraembryonic membrane, the allantois, develops as an outpocketing of the embryo's rudimentary gut, as it does in the chick. The allantois is incorporated into the umbilical cord, where it forms blood vessels that transport oxygen and nutrients from the placenta to the embryo and rid the embryo of carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes. Thus, the extraembryonic membranes of shelled eggs, where embryos are nourished with yolk, were conserved as mammals diverged from reptiles in the course of evolution, but with modifications adapted to development within the reproductive tract of the mother.

Organogenesis begins with the formation of the neural tube, notochord, and somites. By the end of the first trimester of human development, rudiments of all the major organs have developed from the three germ layers, as was summarized in TABLE 47.1.





 Morphogenesis in animals involves specific changes in cell shape, position, and adhesion

Morphogenesis is a major aspect of development in both animals and plants, but only in animals does it involve the movement of cells. Movement of parts of a cell can bring about changes in cell shape or enable a cell to migrate from one place to another within the embryo. Changes in both cell shape and cell position are involved in cleavage, gastrulation, and organogenesis.

Changes in the shape of a cell usually involve reorganization of the cytoskeleton (see Chapter 7). Consider, for example, how the cells of the neural plate form the neural tube (FIGURE 47.16). First, microtubules oriented parallel to the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo apparently help lengthen the cells in that direction. At the dorsal end of each cell is a parallel array of actin filaments oriented crosswise. These contract, giving the cells a wedge shape that forces the ectoderm layer to bend inward. Similar cell-shape changes are observed for other invaginations (inpocketings) and evaginations (outpocketings) of tissue layers throughout development.

Fig 47-16. Change in cellular shape during morphogenesis. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton is associated with morphogenetic changes in embryonic tissues. As indicated here, in the formation of the neural tube of vertebrates, microtubules help elongate the cells of the neural plate. Microfilaments at the dorsal end of the cells may then contract, deforming the cells into wedge shapes and causing the ectoderm to bend inward.

The cytoskeleton also drives the active movement of cells from one place to another in developing animals. Cells "crawl" within the embryo by using cytoskeletal fibers to extend and retract cellular protrusions. This type of motility is akin to the amoeboid movement described in FIGURE 7.27b, but in contrast to the thick pseudopodia of amoeboid cells, the cellular protrusions of migrating embryonic cells are usually flat sheets (lamellipodia) or spikes (filopodia). In the gastrulation of some organisms, invagination is initiated by wedging of cells on the surface of the blastula, but the penetration of cells deeper into the embryo involves the extension of filopodia by cells at the leading edge of the migrating tissue. By dragging behind them the cells that follow them through the blastopore, the leading cells help move a sheet of cells from the embryo's surface into the blastocoel, where it forms the endoderm and mesoderm of the embryo (see FIGURE 47.9). There are also many situations in which cells migrate individually, as when the cells of the neural crest disperse to various parts of the embryo.

Cell crawling is also involved in a type of morphogenetic movement called convergent extension (FIGURE 47.17). In convergent extension, the cells of a tissue layer rearrange themselves in such a way that the sheet of cells becomes narrower (converges) while it becomes longer (extends). When many cells wedge between one another, the tissue can extend dramatically. Convergent extension is important in early embryonic development. It occurs, for example, as the archenteron elongates in sea urchin embryos and during involution in the frog gastrula.

Fig 47-17. Convergent extension of a sheet of cells. In this simplified diagram, changes in cell shape and position cause the layer of cells to become narrower and longer. An unknown signal causes the cells to elongate in a particular directon and to crawl between each other. The result of this convergence is the extension of the cell sheet in a direction perpendicular to the convergence.

Scientists do not yet understand exactly what triggers and directs convergent extension. However, the process probably involves the extracellular matrix (ECM), the mixture of secreted glycoproteins lying outside the plasma membranes of cells (see FIGURE 7.29). The ECM is known to help guide cells in many types of morphogenetic movements. ECM fibers may function as tracks, directing migrating cells along particular routes (FIGURE 47.18). Several kinds of extracellular glycoproteins, including various fibronectins, help cells move by providing anchorage for cell crawling. Other substances in the ECM keep cells on the correct paths by inhibiting migration in certain directions. Thus, depending on the substances they secrete, nonmigratory cells situated along migration pathways may promote or inhibit movement of other cells. As migrating cells move along specific paths through the embryo, receptor proteins on their surfaces pick up directional cues from the immediate environment. Signals from the receptors direct the cytoskeletal elements to propel the cell in the proper direction.

Fig 47-18. The extracellular matrix and cell migration. The micrographs here provide evidence that the orientation of the extracellular fibers of the ECM is controlled by the orientation of the cytoskeleton in the cells that secrete the extracellular materials. This is one way that a group of cells can influence the path along which another group of cells migrates during the development of tissues and organs. (a) Cells from the neural crest migrate along a strip of fibronectin fibers placed on an artificial underlayer (LM). (b) Two different fluorescent dyes demonstrate the close relationship between the orientation of fibronectin fibers of the ECM (left) and that of contractile microfilaments of the cytoskeleton (right) for two migrating cells (LMs). Notice that the orientations of the intracellular microfilaments and extracellular fibers correspond.

A good example of the role of the ECM in embryonic cell migration is the movement of mesoderm cells along fibronectin during amphibian gastrulation. Fibronectin fibers line the roof of the blastocoel, and as the mesoderm moves into the interior of the embryo, the cells at the free edge of the mesoderm sheet migrate along the fibers. Researchers can disrupt the ability of cells to attach to fibronectin by, for example, injecting embryos with antibodies against fibronectin. Such a disruption can block the inward movement of the mesoderm.

The glycoproteins that attach migrating cells to an underlying ECM also play a role in holding cells together when migrating cells reach their destinations and tissues and organs take shape. Also contributing to cell migration and stable tissue structure are glycoproteins called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which are located on the surfaces of cells and bind to CAMs on other cells. CAMs vary in either amount or chemical identity from one type of cell to another, and these differences help regulate morphogenetic movements and tissue building.

One important class of cell-to-cell adhesion molecules is the cadherins, which are so named because they require the presence of calcium ions for proper function. There are many different cadherins, and the gene for each cadherin is expressed in specific locations at specific times during embryonic development. Researchers have vividly demonstrated the importance of one particular cadherin in the formation of the frog blastula (FIGURE 47.19).

Fig 47-19. The role of a cadherin in frog blastula formation. (a) Researchers injected Xenopus oocytes with nucleic acid comple-mentary to the mRNA encoding a cadherin known as EP cadherin. The "antisense" nucleic acid causes the destruction of the normal mRNA so that no protein is produced (see discussion of RNA interference in Chapter 20). The absence of EP cadherin protein interfered with the development of the blastula. The blastocoel did not form properly, and the cells arranged themselves in a disorganized fashion. (b) In control embryos, the blastocoel formed normally.





 The developmental fate of cells depends on cytoplasmic determinants and cell-cell induction: a review

Coupled with the morphogenetic changes that give an animal and its parts their characteristic shapes, development also requires the timely differentiation of many kinds of cells in specific locations. As we discussed in Chapter 21, two general principles integrate our current knowledge of the genetic and cellular mechanisms that underlie differentiation during embryonic development:

In many animal species (mammals may be a major exception), the heterogeneous distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the unfertilized egg leads to regional differences in the early embryo. By partitioning the heterogeneous cytoplasm of a polarized egg, cleavage parcels out different mRNAs, proteins, and other molecules to different blastomeres. These local differences in cytoplasmic composition help specify the body axes and influence the expression of genes that affect the developmental fate of cells. Thus, cytoplasmic determinants are responsible for the initial differences between cells in the early embryos of many kinds of animals.

Subsequently, in induction, interactions among the embryonic cells themselves induce changes in gene expression. These interactions eventually bring about the differentiation of the many specialized cell types making up a new animal. Induction may be mediated by diffusible chemical signals, or if the cells are actually in contact, by cell-surface interactions. (In Chapter 21 we saw how both types of cell signaling are involved in the development of the nematode vulva.)

It will help to keep these two principles in mind when we take a closer look at the molecular and cellular mechanisms of differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrate development. First, however, let's look at some historic experiments that provided early researchers with information about cell fates.





 Fate mapping can reveal cell genealogies in chordate embryos

You may recall that in the case of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it has been possible to map the developmental history of every cell, beginning with the first cleavage division of the zygote (see FIGURE 21.4). This sort of complete cell lineage has not been determined for other animals, but biologists have been making more general territorial diagrams of embryonic development, called fate maps, for over 70 years. Classic studies performed in the 1920s by German embryologist W. Vogt established that in embryos whose axes are defined early in development, it is often possible to ascertain which parts of the embryo will be derived from each region of the zygote or blastula. Following the lead of earlier work on marine worms and mollusks, Vogt charted fate maps for amphibian embryos (FIGURE 47.20a). Using nontoxic dyes, he labeled cells of different regions of the surface of amphibian blastulas with different colors and later sectioned the embryos to see where the colors turned up. Vogt's results were among the earliest indications that the lineage (the "genealogy") of cells making up the three germ layers created by gastrulation is traceable to cells in the blastula (compare FIGURES 47.20a and FIGURES 47.10). Later researchers developed more sophisticated techniques that allowed them to mark an individual blastomere during cleavage and then follow the marker as it was distributed to all the mitotic descendants of that cell (FIGURE 47.20b).

Fig 47-20. Fate maps for two chordates. (a) Fate map of a frog embryo. The fates of cells of a frog embryo were determined in part by marking different regions of the blastula surface with dyes of various colors and then determining the locations of dyed cells at later stages of development, such as at this neural tube stage. (b) Cell lineage analysis in a tunicate. Shown here are the results of a very specific type of fate map called a cell lineage analysis. The drawings depict 64-cell embryos of a tunicate, an invertebrate chordate. An individual cell can be injected with a dye, enabling a researcher to determine which cells in a later embryo are derived from the marked cells. The two light micrographs of larvae contrast the regions that develop from the two different blastomeres indicated in the drawings.

Developmental biologists have combined fate-mapping studies with experimental manipulation of parts of embryos in which they study whether a cell's fate can be changed by moving it elsewhere in the embryo. Two important conclusions have emerged. First, in most animals, certain early "founder cells" generate specific tissues of the older embryo. Second, as development proceeds, a cell's developmental potential--the range of structures that it can give rise to--becomes restricted. Starting with the normal embryo's fate map, researchers can examine how the differentiation of cells is altered in experimental situations or in mutant embryos.





 The eggs of most vertebrates have cytoplasmic determinants that help establish the body axes and differences among cells of the early embryo

In order to understand at the molecular level how embryonic cells acquire their fates, we must return to the question of how the basic axes of the embryo are established. It turns out that much of what you learned in Chapter 21 about the roles of cytoplasmic determinants in the development of fruit flies also applies to vertebrate animals.

Polarity and the Basic Body Plan

As you have learned, a bilaterally symmetrical animal has an anterior-posterior axis, a dorsal-ventral axis, and left and right sides. Establishing this basic body plan is a first step in morphogenesis and is prerequisite to the development of tissues and organs. In mammals, polarity is not obvious until after cleavage, although recent research suggests that the location at which the sperm enters the egg plays a role in determining the axes. However, in most species, basic instructions (where the head end will be, and so on) are set down earlier. For example, in many frogs, as we saw in FIGURE 47.7, the locations of melanin and yolk in the unfertilized egg respectively define the animal and vegetal hemispheres, which in turn determine the anterior-posterior body axis. Fertilization then triggers the formation of the gray crescent, whose position determines the dorsal-ventral axis.

Restriction of Cellular Potency

The asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in an egg does not necessarily lead to differences among the earliest blastomeres. The first cleavage may occur along an axis that produces two identical blastomeres, which will have equal developmental potential. This is what happens in amphibians, for instance. The first two blastomeres are similar, and if they are experimentally separated, each can develop into a normal tadpole. In other words, both blastomeres are totipotent. However, in experiments in which the entire gray crescent goes to one blastomere, only that blastomere has the capacity to develop into a normal tadpole when the blastomeres are separated (FIGURE 47.21). Thus, the fates of embryonic cells can be affected not only by the distribution of cytoplasmic determinants but also by the zygote's characteristic pattern of cleavage.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 47-21. Experimental demonstration of the importance of cytoplasmic determinants in amphibians. The first cleavage division of an amphibian zygote normally divides the gray crescent evenly between the two blastomeres, which retain their totipotency after the division (left). However, when one blastomere receives the entire gray crescent (right), only that blastomere develops normally. The other blastomere, lacking cytoplasmic determinants present in the crescent, gives rise to an abnormal embryo without dorsal structures.

In many species, only the zygote is totipotent. The first cleavage plane divides cytoplasmic determinants in such a way that each blastomere will give rise only to specific parts of the embryo. In contrast, the cells of mammalian embryos remain totipotent until they become arranged into the trophoblast and inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The early blastomeres of mammals seem to receive equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic components from the egg. Indeed, up to the eight-cell stage, the blastomeres of a mammalian embryo all look alike, and each can form a complete embryo if isolated.

However similar or different the cells in an early embryo, the progressive restriction of potency is a general feature of development in all animals. In some species the cells of early gastrulas retain the capacity to give rise to more than one kind of cell, though they have lost their totipotency. If left alone, the dorsal ectoderm of an early amphibian gastrula will develop into a neural plate above the notochord. If the dorsal ectoderm is experimentally replaced with ectoderm from some other location, the transplanted tissue will form a neural plate. If the same experiment is performed on a late-stage gastrula, however, the transplanted ectoderm will not respond to its new location and will not form a neural plate. In general, the tissue-specific fates of cells in late gastrulae are fixed. Even when they are manipulated experimentally, cells of late gastrulae usually give rise to the same types of cell as in the normal embryo.





 Inductive signals drive differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrates

As embryonic cell division creates cells with different developmental potential, a new possibility arises. Now one group of cells can influence the development of a neighboring group of cells, in the process called induction. At the molecular level, the effect of induction--the response to an inductive signal--is usually the switching on of a set of genes that make the receiving cells differentiate into a specific tissue. You have already learned about the role of induction in vulval development in C. elegans (see FIGURE 21.17). Induction is an essential process in the development of many tissues in other animals as well.

The "Organizer" of Spemann and Mangold

The importance of induction in amphibian development was dramatically demonstrated in the 1920s by German zoologist Hans Spemann and his student Hilde Mangold. In a series of transplantation experiments, they discovered that the dorsal lip of the blastopore in the early gastrula plays a key role in embryonic development, initiating a chain of inductions that results in the formation of the neural tube and other organs. In their most famous experiment, they took a piece of dorsal lip from one embryo and grafted it on the ventral side of a second embryo (FIGURE 47.22). The result was the development of a second notochord and neural tube in the recipient embryo, at the location of the graft. Subsequently, other organs and structures formed, creating a nearly complete second embryo attached to the first. Spemann referred to the dorsal lip of the blastopore as the primary organizer of the embryo because of its early and crucial role in development. (We now know of other "organizers" that act even earlier than the dorsal lip of the blastopore.)

Fig 47-22. The "organizer" of Spemann and Mangold. The dorsal lip of the blastopore in the early gastrula of an amphibian plays a critical role in inducing the development of other parts of the embryo, as Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold demonstrated with this experiment in 1924.

Developmental biologists are working intensively to identify the molecular basis of induction by Spemann's organizer. An important clue has come from studies of a growth factor called bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4). (Bone morphogenetic proteins, a family of related proteins with a variety of developmental roles, derive their name from members of the family that are important in bone formation.) Amphibian BMP-4 is active exclusively in cells on the ventral side of the gastrula. One major function of organizer cells seems to be to inactivate BMP-4 on the dorsal side of the embryo by producing proteins that bind to BMP-4, rendering it unable to signal. Proteins related to BMP-4 and its inhibitors are also found in other animals, including invertebrates such as the fruit fly. The ubiquity of these molecules suggests that they evolved long ago and may participate in the development of many different organisms.

The induction that causes dorsal ectoderm to develop into the neural tube is only one of many cell-cell interactions that transform the three germ layers into organ systems. Many inductions seem to involve a sequence of inductive steps that progressively determine the fate of cells. For example, in the late gastrula of the frog, ectoderm cells destined to become the lenses of the eyes receive inductive signals from the ectodermal cells that will become the neural plate. Additional inductive signals probably come from endodermal cells and mesodermal cells. Finally, inductive signals from the optic cup, an outgrowth of the developing brain, complete the determination of the lens-forming cells.

Pattern Formation in the Vertebrate Limb

Inductive signals play a major role in pattern formation--the development of an animal's spatial organization, the arrangement of organs and tissues in their characteristic places in three-dimensional space. The molecular cues that control pattern formation, called positional information, tell a cell where it is with respect to the animal's body axes and help to determine how the cell and its descendants respond to future molecular signals.

In Chapter 21 we discussed pattern formation in the development of the body segments of Drosophila. For understanding pattern formation in vertebrates, an important model system has been limb development in the chick. The wings and legs of chicks, like all vertebrate limbs, begin as bumps of tissue called limb buds (FIGURE 47.23). Each component of a chick limb, such as a specific bone or muscle, develops with a precise location and orientation relative to three axes: the proximal-distal axis (the "shoulder-to-fingertip" axis), the anterior-posterior axis (the "thumb-to-little finger" axis), and the dorsal-ventral axis (the "knuckle-to-palm" axis). The embryonic cells within a limb bud respond to positional information indicating location along these three axes.

Fig 47-23. Organizer regions in vertebrate limb development.

A limb bud consists of a core of mesodermal tissue covered by a layer of ectoderm. By removing or transplanting different pieces of tissue, researchers have discovered two critical organizer regions in the limb bud, regions with profound effects on the limb's development. These two organizer regions are present in all vertebrate limb buds, including those that will develop into forelimbs (such as wings or arms) and those destined to become hindlimbs. In recent years researchers have established that the cells of these regions secrete proteins that provide key positional information to the other cells of the bud.

One limb-bud organizer region is the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a thickened area of ectoderm at the tip of the bud (see FIGURE 47.23a). The AER is required for the outgrowth of the limb along the proximal-distal axis and for patterning along this axis. The cells of the AER produce and secrete several proteins of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. These proteins appear to be the growth signal that promotes limb bud outgrowth. If the AER is surgically removed and beads soaked with FGF are put in its place, a nearly normal limb will develop. The AER and other ectoderm of the limb bud also appear to guide pattern formation along the limb's dorsal-ventral axis. In experiments where the ectoderm of a limb bud is detached from the mesoderm and then replaced with its orientation rotated 180&#176;, the limb elements that form have reversed dorsal-ventral orientation. (This is equivalent to reversing the palm and back of your hand.)

The second major limb-bud organizer region is the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), located where the posterior side of the bud is attached to the body. The ZPA is necessary for proper pattern formation along the anterior-posterior axis of the limb. Cells nearest the ZPA give rise to posterior structures, such as the digit homologous to our little finger, and cells farthest from the ZPA form anterior structures, such as the avian equivalent of our thumb. A tissue transplantation experiment demonstrating the importance of the ZPA is shown in FIGURE 47.24. Grafting a second ZPA on the anterior side of a limb bud leads to the formation of extra digits, in a mirror-image arrangement.

Fig 47-24. The experimental manipulation of positional information. The zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) issues molecular signals that establish the anterior-posterior axis of a vertebrate limb. In the experiment shown here, a second ZPA was added to the anterior margin of a chick limb bud by transplanting ZPA tissue from another limb bud. Cells near the grafted ZPA, like cells near the host bud's own ZPA, apparently receive positional information indicating "posterior." The pattern that emerges in the developing limb is a mirror image, with an arrangement of digits equivalent to two human hands joined together at the thumbs. In a subsequent experiment, researchers showed that a protein called Sonic hedgehog could substitute for the ZPA cells. Thus Sonic hedgehog functions as a positional cue.

In the ZPA-transplantation experiment, the extra digits develop from the host limb bud and not from the graft, supporting the hypothesis that the grafted ZPA produces some sort of inductive signal. Indeed, researchers have discovered that the cells of the ZPA secrete an important protein growth factor called Sonic hedgehog.* If cells genetically engineered to produce large amounts of Sonic hedgehog are implanted in the anterior region of a normal limb bud, a mirror-image limb results--just as if a ZPA had been grafted there. Evidence from studying the mouse version of Sonic hedgehog suggests that extra toes in mice--and perhaps also in humans--can result from the production of the protein in the wrong part of the limb bud. Proteins very similar to Sonic hedgehog have turned out to be important positional cues in a number of developmental situations, including segment formation in the Drosophila embryo. (The fruit-fly version, called simply Hedgehog, is the product of a segment-polarity gene; see FIGURE 21.13.)

Is Sonic hedgehog a morphogen? Recall from Chapter 21 that a morphogen is a substance that provides positional information in the form of a concentration gradient along an embryonic axis. Although gradients may be involved in the functioning of Sonic hedgehog, the Sonic hedgehog protein itself may not act in a graded manner; instead it may induce the production of something else that does. Researchers are currently investigating this issue.

In any case, we can conclude from experiments like the one in FIGURE 47.24 that pattern formation requires cells to receive and interpret environmental cues that vary from one location to another. These cues, acting together along three axes, tell cells where they are in the three-dimensional realm of a developing organ. In vertebrate limb development, we now know that specific proteins serve as some of these cues. In other words, organizer regions such as the AER and the ZPA function as signaling centers.

What determines whether a limb bud develops into a forelimb or a hindlimb? The cells receiving the signals from the AER and ZPA respond according to their developmental histories. Before the AER or ZPA issues its signals, earlier developmental signals have set up patterns of gene expression distinguishing the future forelimbs from the future hindlimbs. These differences cause the cells of the forelimb and hindlimb limb buds to react differently to the same positional cues.

A hierarchy of gene activations eventually affects the expression of homeobox-containing (Hox) genes in cells of the developing limb. Hox genes seem to be involved in specifying the identity of various regions of the limbs, as well as of the body as a whole (see Chapter 21). Thus, pattern formation is a chain of events involving many steps of signaling and differentiation. Various pathways of pattern formation occur in all the different parts of the developing embryo, eventually producing the final set of differentiated structures in the fully formed animal.
