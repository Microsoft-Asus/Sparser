Natural selection requires hereditary processes that Darwin could not explain. His theory was based on what seems like a paradox of inheritance: Like begets like--but not exactly. What was missing in Darwin’s explanations was an understanding of inheritance that could explain how chance variations arise in a population while also accounting for the precise transmission of these variations from parents to offspring. Although Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin were contemporaries, Mendel’s discoveries were unappreciated at the time, and apparently no one noticed that he had elucidated the very principles of inheritance that could have resolved Darwin’s paradox and given credibility to natural selection.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
