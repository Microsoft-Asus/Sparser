MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Talks between the Russian and Japanese prime ministers were expected to jump to the bottom line Friday : When can Japan hand over an dlrs 800 million installment on a loan it promised last summer ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">On the second day of his Moscow summit , Keizo Obuchi of Japan was meeting his Russian counterpart , Yevgeny Primakov , for talks that were expected to focus on the nuts and bolts -- or , more accurately , rubles and yen -- of the two countries ' relations .</ENAMEX>
The day before , Japanese Premier Keizo Obuchi and Russian President Boris Yeltsin `` exchanged views from broad and lofty perspectives , '' as Obuchi 's spokesman put it .
The two made incremental progress toward solving a dispute over the Kuril Islands that has kept the two countries from signing a peace treaty to formally end World War II .
Japanese spokesman Sadaaki Numata observed that it was `` not the sort of discussion that might take place between bankers . ''
That sort of talk was reserved for Friday 's meeting between Obuchi and Primakov .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">While the subject of the disputed islands was likely to come up , the main focus of the two premiers ' discussions was expected to be the timing and logistics of Japan 's loan , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .</ENAMEX>
The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer .
Both the IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its economic crisis in August .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In addition to agreeing to free up the loan , Obuchi has offered to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on the Kuril islands , dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to support youth exchange programs .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The two prime ministers were expected to sign a spate of agreements , including one on guarantees of capital investments that is expected to pave the way for large-scale Japanese investment in Russia , ITAR - Tass said .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">They also were expected to sign memorandums on cooperation in tourism , transport , mail and telecommunications , as well as support for Russia 's and medium-size companies .</ENAMEX>
Also , the premiers were expected to release a declaration that sums up the progress so far in resolving the Kuril dispute .
Tokyo claimed title to the islands -- Etorofu , Kunashiri , Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- in a treaty with Russia in 1875 .
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War II , a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal .
The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian residents , many of whom would welcome Japanese administration .
The Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters .
