Chapter 50: AN INTRODUCTION TO ECOLOGY AND THE BIOSPHERE

THE SCOPE OF ECOLOGY

   The interactions between organisms and their environments determine the distribution and abundance of organisms

   Ecology and evolutionary biology are closely related sciences

   Ecological research ranges from the adaptations of individual organisms to the dynamics of the biosphere

   Ecology provides a scientific context for evaluating environmental issues



FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS

   Species dispersal contributes to the distribution of organisms

   Behavior and habitat selection contribute to the distribution of organisms

   Biotic factors affect the distribution of organisms

   Abiotic factors affect the distribution of organisms

   Temperature and water are the major climatic factors determining the distribution of organisms



AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL BIOMES

   Aquatic biomes occupy the largest part of the biosphere

   The geographic distribution of terrestrial biomes is based mainly on regional variations in climate



THE SPATIAL SCALE OF DISTRIBUTIONS

   Different factors may determine the distribution of a species on different scales

   Most species have small geographic ranges

Organisms are open systems that interact continuously with their environments--a theme that has already surfaced many times in this book. The scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environments is called ecology (from the Greek oikos, home, and logos, to study). It is these interactions that determine both the distribution and abundance of organisms, resulting in the two questions that ecologists so often ask about organisms: Where do they live? And how many are there? Ecology is an enormously complex and exciting area of biology that is also of critical practical importance. Photographs of our planet taken by Apollo astronauts, such as the one on this page, remind us that Earth is a finite home in the vastness of space, not an unlimited frontier for human activity. The science of ecology can provide us with the basic understanding that we need to manage our planet's limited resources.

This chapter introduces the breadth of ecology and surveys some of the factors, both living and nonliving, that affect the distribution of organisms.
