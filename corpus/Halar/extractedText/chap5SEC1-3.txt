LIPIDS--DIVERSE HYDROPHOBIC MOLECULES

 

 Fats store large amounts of energy



 

 Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes



 

 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones



Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that does not include polymers. The compounds called lipids are grouped together because they share one important trait: They have little or no affinity for water. The hydrophobic behavior of lipids is based on their molecular structure. Although they may have some polar bonds associated with oxygen, lipids consist mostly of hydrocarbons. Smaller than true (polymeric) macromolecules, lipids are a highly varied group in both form and function. Lipids include waxes and certain pigments, but we will focus on the most important families of lipids: the fats, phospholipids, and steroids.
