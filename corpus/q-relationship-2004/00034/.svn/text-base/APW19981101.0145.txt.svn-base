SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The business deals between North Korea and South Korea 's largest conglomerate underscore the dire economic need of the cash-strapped communist North , analysts said Sunday .
Analysts in Seoul also expected the Hyundai deals to spur wide-ranging civilian economic exchanges between the rival Korean states , helping to ease tension on the divided peninsula .</ENAMEX>
Chung Ju -yung , founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai group , returned from a visit to North Korea Saturday , declaring that he has Pyongyang 's full approval for a series of joint venture projects in the North .
`` The deal shows that North Korea , badly in need of cash , wants to lift its economic openness to a higher level , '' said Kwon Kyong -bok , an analyst at Naewoe Press , run by Seoul 's main intelligence organization , the Agency for National Security Planning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A key Hyundai venture is a plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week aboard two luxury cruise ships for a tour of Diamond Mountain , a major attraction on the North 's east coast , beginning Nov. 18 .
Other Hyundai - North Korea deals include offshore oil exploration , and building a power plant , a gymnasium and a ship repair yard .
For the tourism project , Hyundai will pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years -- an amount that slightly exceeds the North 's 1997 exports .</ENAMEX>
`` For economic reasons , North Korea has to open its society even if it involves some risks , '' said Kim Sung -chul , a researcher at the state-funded Research Institute for National Unification .
North Korea 's economy is in shambles , and its farms have been hit by floods and drought in recent years .
U.S. officials said up to 2 million people might have died of hunger in the past three years in the reclusive country , which simply has no money to feed its 23 million people .
`` North Korea has known that tourism is the best way to earn foreign currency , but it has been reluctant to push it because of the risk that it could ideologically contaminate its people and threaten its regime , '' Kim said .
`` But I believe that the North 's economic situation has reached the point where it has to put up with such foreseeable risks , '' he added .
Since 1995 , the U.N. relief agencies have received dlrs 359 million in international donations to help ease the North 's food crisis , only 46 percent of the target amount .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">As foreign food aid for North Korea keeps dwindling , the Stalinist state has had to turn to South Korean businesses for cash , analysts in Seoul said</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` As it cashes in on Hyundai , North Korea will be further inclined to open itself to outside investment , which in turn will help ease tension with South Korea , '' said Paek Sung -ki , a political science professor at Kyongwon University .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to jointly drill for oil on North Korea 's west coast and , if successful , to lay an oil pipeline to South Korea .</ENAMEX>
But South Korean officials are skeptical .
`` A small amount of oil , say , about 450 barrels a day , was found off the North 's west coast in 1996 but there are no indications that it and other offshore or onshore fields are economically feasible , '' said Ra Byong -sun , president of Seoul 's state-run Korea Petroleum Development Corp. The Hyundai deals are the first result of the South Korean government 's `` sunshine policy '' aimed at opening up the North 's isolated society through expanded civilian contacts .
While shunning official contact with the Seoul government , which it considers a U.S. `` puppet , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">North Korea is actively wooing investment from South Korean businesses .</ENAMEX>
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` As shown in Hyundai 's case , the sunshine policy has been proven to be a two-way road , ultimately benefiting both sides of Korea , '' Paek of Kyongwon University said .</ENAMEX>
