Though some species, such as sea grasses, have returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution, most plants live in terrestrial environments, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests. For now, we will refer to all of these organisms as <span class="Emphasis1">land</span> plants, even those that are now aquatic, to distinguish them from the algae we discussed as photosynthetic protists in Chapter 28. But land plants did indeed evolve from certain green algae called charophyceans, and we will explore this phylogenetic connection later in the chapter. This section introduces the diversity of modern land plants in the context of their terrestrial adaptations.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
