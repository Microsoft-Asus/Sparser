With eventual agreement from the Russian Space Agency , NASA rejected an 11th-hour request by the Russians to change the orbital assembly site of the international space station so that it would be closer to the aging Mir outpost , U.S. officials said Friday .
`` We both concluded it added technical complexity and risk to the mission that was not justified , '' said Randy Brinkley , NASA 's space station program manager .
`` It came very late in the planning and operational phases , and it had significant impacts in terms of changes to the mission profile . ''
The request from the Russian aerospace company that operates Mir was forwarded to NASA late last week .
The assembly phase of the new station is scheduled to begin Friday , Nov. 20 , at 1 : 40 a.m .
EST , with the launching of the first component from Central Asia .
The Russian request was made so that future Progress cargo capsules could ferry several thousand pounds of research equipment from the 13-year -old Mir outpost to the new station .
But the new location would have prompted a considerable number of changes in the launches of other components that will be added through 2004 .
Brinkley said U.S. and Russian station planners engaged in what he termed `` frank and candid '' discussions over the request until early this week .
The Russians suggested earlier this week that they had withdrawn the request on their own .
The issue was formally put to rest early Friday in discussions between the top Russian and U.S. space agency officials .
Brinkley said the Americans would consider future proposals from the Russians to move equipment between the two stations as long as they did not jeopardize efforts to assemble the new orbital laboratory .
The aborted request was just the latest in a series of distractions for the project , most of them linked to Russian financial difficulties and its own internal politics .

But some forces within the country oppose the station 's demise because it is a symbol of national pride and a source of funds from foreign astronauts .
