JASPER , Texas
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Items found in the apartment of an alleged white supremacist had stains of blood from a black man dragged to his death behind a pickup truck , according to a DNA analyst for the FBI .
Frank Baechtel , an FBI forensics examiner , testified Friday that clothes seized from John King 's apartment were splashed with blood from James Byrd Jr. , the 49-year -old man killed last June when he was chained to the truck and dragged for three miles .
King , 24 , is the first of three white men on trial for the murder , which prosecutors have said was intended as an initiation rite for a white supremacist gang being formed by King .
Shawn Berry , 24 , and Lawrence Brewer , 31 , are to be tried later .
They all face life in prison or death by injection if convicted .
Byrd 's DNA also was found on shoes worn by each of the defendants , as well as on tires from the truck authorities said was used in the dragging , Baechtel said .
Altogether , 13 pieces of evidence , including a shoe , a boot and a sandal were found to contain Byrd 's DNA .
Defense attorney Haden Cribbs declined to comment outside court .
In other testimony Friday , a Houston expert on gangs said his examination of King 's writings indicated the convicted burglar wanted to create a white supremacist group and needed to commit a crime to establish credibility .
William Knox said he was interested by the fact that Byrd 's headless torso was dumped on a road between a black cemetery and church .
`` There 's plenty of places here to hide a body and leave it undiscovered for long period of time , '' Knox said .
`` In this case , it was a public place .
This was designed to strike terror in the community . ''
Defense attorneys contend King adopted a racist agenda as the result of an assault and to help him cope with black inmates in prison .
Two witnesses , including Berry 's brother , Louis , testified that King was especially proud of a tattoo on his arm depicting the silhouette of a black man hanging from a tree .
King called it `` my little hanging nigger , '' Louis Berry said .
`` I do n't think it should happen to anybody , the way this happened , '' he said .
`` All of it .
I do n't agree with it .
People I associate with , friends and family , they do n't agree with it either . ''
