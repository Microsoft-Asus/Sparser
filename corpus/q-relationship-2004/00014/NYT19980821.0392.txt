The American missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan follow the Israeli model of a quick , tough response to terrorism -- a shift in US strategy that experts praised Friday for finally putting militants on notice that they 'll pay a high price if they continue their aggression .
At the same time , they agreed that if Washington 's new behavior becomes ongoing policy , it carries a potentially huge cost of its own : thrusting this country into a cycle of violence of a kind that Israel has experienced for decades .
`` There is something in these operations which very much resembles what has been Israeli policy , '' said Shai Feldman , head of the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University .
`` And I think it is the result of a realization that you ca n't let people around the world just keep blowing up American embassies and killing Americans ... and the United States will not react and the perpetrators will go unpunished . ''
Feldman added a caution , however .
`` The United States will have to start living with the fact , '' he said , `` that such operations will cause some unpleasant reactions . ''
Indeed , it appeared Friday that a strike-counterstrike escalation may already be in the offing .
Within hours of each other , Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in Washington that more US assaults are being planned and may be executed , and the editor of a London -based Arab newspaper transmitted a threat from Osama bin Laden -- whose alleged terrorist activities instigated Thursday 's US bombings -- to retaliate with additional attacks against American targets .
Analysts with strong ties to the National Security Council said they understood that the Defense Department has already plotted the next American strikes .
They said that the intent was not only to damage terrorists ' infrastructures before they could strike again , but also to reverse an international perception of the United States as a tough talker in areas from Bosnia to North Korea to Iraq , but that 's one unwilling to back its words with action .
`` It 's only the beginning .
There are going to be more strikes , because it 's a message , not just about counterterrorism but about American authority , '' said Bill Taylor , director of the political-military program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
`` This week 's hits were not a whim .
They were a signal : Look out , here we come . ''
Israeli counter-terrorism specialists saw another similarity between the American attacks and their own country 's approach to terrorism ; that is , the underlying notion of both is to hit before getting hit .
US officials said the bombings in Afghanistan essentially were conducted for self-defense reasons , to destroy the terrorists ' potential to carry out additional actions that they 'd already planned .
`` If you get information about active bases where plans are being designed , you bomb , you do n't wait for them to do it first , '' said Yigal Carmon , who was the adviser on terrorism to Prime Ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin .
But Israeli attacks on terrorists , some of which have never been publicly acknowledged , have proved costly .
In 1992 , for example , an Israeli helicopter rocketed a car carrying a leader of the radical group Hezbollah , Abbas Musawi , killing him , his wife , and their infant child .
A month later , a bomb believed to have been planted by Hezbollah ripped through the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires , killing 30 people .
And in February 1996 , Hamas bomb-maker Yehiya Ayyash was killed by a booby-trapped cellular phone in the Gaza Strip .
Militants blamed Israel for his death , which was followed by four suicide bombings that killed 58 people in the Jewish state .
`` Of course in some cases there is retaliation , but what is the answer , to keep quiet and act like a lamb and do n't fight the terrorists and let them strengthen themselves and develop ? '' asked Carmon .
The counterterrorism experts said the United States must take into account in pursuing its current tactics that any attack is likely to boost the targeted group 's motivation to retaliate .
But they added that the attack also could cut the group 's operational abilities , something US officials say was done to bin Laden 's organizations this week .
Moreover , some assaults can succeed in the long term .
For instance , after the leader of the militant Palestinian organization Islamic Jihad was assassinated in Malta in 1995 , presumably by Israeli agents , the group never recovered .
Politically and militarily , the calculation for the United States clearly is different than it is for Israel , which stands at the center of a region rife with hostility and whose people solidly support military responses to perceived or real threats .
Notwithstanding the skepticism of many Americans that President Clinton acted this week to distract attention from his domestic woes , the climate in this country may be shifting as a result of the bombings in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center in New York .
There was little criticism , experts pointed out , of the American attacks for having risked innocent lives or even for not-so-covertly targeting bin Laden , even though US law forbids deliberate assassinations .
Moreover , some political analysts said that if this week 's attacks turn out to be a one-shot deal rather than a sustained policy , Clinton risks looking like he really was recreating the script of the movie `` Wag the Dog . ''
`` I would bet the store ... that this is the start of a new phase in our foreign policy , '' said Richard Shultz , head of the International Security Studies program at the Fletcher School of Diplomacy .
`` And it does have a positive lesson from Israeli , that by being offensive ... you put the terrorists on the defensive , and give those who direct terrorism against us currently do n't have to worry about . ''
But he and others added that there are downsides , in addition to the possibility of creating a cycle of violence .
Those include questions about whether democracies like the United States should engage in essentially undeclared wars , and whether such actions will end terrorism or just fuel it .
`` If the embassy bombings in East Africa represent how the game is going to be played , we 're really up against it , '' said Shultz .
`` There 's nothing you can do defensively about things like that .
You just ca n't build enough walls .
It 's a scary thing . ''
