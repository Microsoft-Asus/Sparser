<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Nobel Peace Prize -winner David Trimble is under pressure from all sides as his Ulster Unionist Party holds its annual conference Saturday .
The Protestant leader shared this year 's prize with Catholic moderate John Hume .</ENAMEX>
However , it is unclear if the international acclaim will strengthen Trimble 's ability to keep his party from splitting over formation of a cross-community government for Northern Ireland .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble was credited with delivering a bare majority of Protestant support for April 's accord on Northern Ireland .
A legislative Assembly was elected in June and nominated him to head a new administration .
But he commands support from only 30 of the 58 Unionist members in the Assembly .</ENAMEX>
Trimble has insisted he wo n't agree to form any government involving the IRA -allied Sinn Fein party unless the Irish Republican Army starts disarming .
Sinn Fein leaders blame him for the gridlock in formation of the government -- intended as the bedrock of the agreement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume 's Social Democratic and Labor Party</ENAMEX> , the major representative of the north 's Irish Catholics , says Trimble is wrong to insist on disarmament now since the agreement specifies only that it should happen by mid-2000 .
But many in Trimble 's party are determined not to take part in a government with Sinn Fein as long as the IRA reserves the right to hold stockpiled weaponry .
`` The Nobel is a great personal honor for David Trimble .
But the Ulster Unionist grassroots would be suspicious of what Mr. Trimble may have had to give away in exchange for that prize , '' said Peter Weir , a former Trimble ally who broke with his leader on the eve of the agreement .
Sinn Fein leaders say the Ulster Unionist chief should wield the Nobel honor as a weapon against his critics .
`` He must tell them that they have had their day , '' said Martin McGuinness , a reputed former IRA commander , who is believed likely to be one of Sinn Fein 's two representatives in any new adminstration .
