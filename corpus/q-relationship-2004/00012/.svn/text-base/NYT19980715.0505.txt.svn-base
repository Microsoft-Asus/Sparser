WASHINGTON --
Two years after the crash of TWA Flight 800 , the National Transportation Safety Board is moving toward finishing its investigation without knowing the source of the spark that touched off the explosion that destroyed the Boeing 747 .
Top officials of the safety board said that within a year they hope to conclude several research projects that will expand their knowledge of how the plane 's center fuel tank reached a state where it could sustain an explosion and allow them to make further recommendations for preventing similar explosions .
But they acknowledge that determining the precise cause of the detonation may be beyond their grasp .
The officials ' comments made it seem more likely that the final report on the accident will not answer what for many in the public remains the central mystery of the crash that took 230 lives on July 17 , 1996 .
But for investigators , the central question has always been how to prevent similar explosions .
And they said that their investigation has already yielded a series of recommendations sufficient to prevent the build-up of fuel vapors in airplane tanks that they believe made the explosion aboard Flight 800 possible .
The officials said that finding the source of the spark is not a reason to continue the investigation indefinitely .
`` If we were able to pinpoint what ignited TWA Flight 800 , and fix that ignition source , there are still the other ignition sources we 've identified as possibilities , and the ones we have n't even thought of , '' said NTSB Chairman James Hall .
Hall said in an interview that he hoped that within the next year the safety board will be able to issue its report on the explosion that destroyed the plane off the coast of Long Island minutes after it took off from Kennedy Airport for Paris .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The safety board has often told the families of those who died in the accident that it may be unable to find the cause of the spark .</ENAMEX>
But the board has only recently set a time frame for ending the investigation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Since the fall of 1996 , when investigators concluded that the 747 's center tank had exploded , their vision of the end point of the investigation has gradually but fundamentally shifted , away from determining what set it off and toward finding out how such explosions can be prevented .</ENAMEX>
The Federal Aviation Administration , which regulates Boeing and the airlines but must defer to the safety board in the investigation , is moving in the same direction , planning steps to reduce the risk of fuel tank explosions without knowing what set off Flight 800 's .
An industry advisory committee , with representatives from Boeing , the airlines , aircraft parts manufacturers and fuel companies , is due to report to the FAA by July 23 , and is likely to recommend that the airlines switch to a fuel blend that does not turn so easily from liquid to vapor , the form that can burn or explode .
TWA says it does not see an end in sight .
`` As far as I know , they 're not even close to any kind of probable cause , '' said airline spokesman Mark Abels .
He said the investigation could last `` many years . ''
But safety board officials are emphasizing not that they are unlikely to pinpoint the cause of the spark , but what they have learned over the last two painstaking years : that the center fuel tank of the 747 exploded ; that far more often than previously believed , the empty space in fuel tanks on other commercial jets have conditions that can sustain such explosions ; that the wiring of old 747 's and other models show a variety of problems , and that simple changes to the fuel or tanks could cut the risk .
Meanwhile , airlines that fly 747 's , warned by Boeing to expect orders soon from the FAA , are inspecting their planes and replacing some parts .
These include parts of the fuel probes , which measure fuel volume , and which were found in the case of Flight 800 and other old 747 's to show flaws .
An increased emphasis on wiring has led to a variety of changes in airplanes , and to the emergency grounding of some older 737 's after flaws in fuel-tank wiring were discovered earlier this year .
On Flight 800 specifically , the NTSB is pursuing several areas of research .
One is computer simulations of center tank explosions , trying to determine from the way this tank came apart where the spark originated .
The tank is about the size of a two-car garage , but it is divided into several chambers , and engineers still hope that further analysis of the damage pattern will tell them more about where ignition occurred .
The board also plans to blow up a full-sized tank from a decommissioned 747 .
The board blew up a similar tank last year , but that tank had previously been damaged , engineers say , and the fuel they used , propane , had more energy than jet fuel does .
The safety board also plans to conduct more test explosions in a one-fourth scale model .
The board may hold another round of hearings in the case this fall , as it did last year in Baltimore .
It also continues to receive a flood of ideas from around the world , from people with a wide variety of backgrounds .
For instance , a retired Navy commander , William Donaldson , after a lengthy and sometimes bitter exchange of letters with the board , has drafted a 96-page report that seeks to persuade the aviation subcommittee of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to hold more hearings on the crash .
Donaldson argues that the plane was destroyed by a missile and that the safety board and the FBI are trying to hide this .
But a member of the aviation subcommittee , Rep. James Traficant , D - Ohio , began looking into the possibility of a missile last September , and concluded in a letter sent Wednesday to the committee chairman , Rep. James Duncan , R - Tenn. , that he had found `` not a single shred of evidence to counter the NTSB 's assertion that the crash was initiated through a fuel air explosion in the center wing fuel tank .

The reconstructed wreckage of the plane itself still sits in a hangar in Calverton , on Long Island .
It may be the longest-surviving TWA 747 , because it will be there for the foreseeable future , and the airline has since scrapped the rest of its 747 's as uneconomical .
No one knows what its long-term future is .
The reconstructed wreckage of Pan Am 103 , another 747 , that was brought down by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie , Scotland , 10 years ago in December , is still standing .
USAir flight 427 , a Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh in September , 1994 , is mostly still in boxes , according to Paul Turk , a spokesman for the airline , now called US Airways .
United Airlines Flight 585 , another 737 , which went down near Colorado Springs in March , 1991 , is also in boxes .
`` Some of it is in a hangar in Colorado Springs , and some of it is in San Francisco at our maintenance base , '' said Joe Hopkins , an airline spokesman .
`` You do reach a point in time where there really is no reason to keep it , '' he said .
But some lawsuits go on for years , he said , and the wreckage could be evidence .
`` You would not keep it for 100 years , '' he said , `` but you might for 15 . ''
