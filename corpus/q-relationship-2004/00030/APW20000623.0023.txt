ALBANY , N.Y .
-LRB- AP -RRB- - Mandatory trigger locks and ballistic `` fingerprinting '' are two of the gun control provisions contained in legislation agreed to Thursday by Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders .
The measure would also raise the legal age for purchasing handguns in New York state from 18 to 21 and require background checks on gun buyers at all gun shows in the state .
The state Senate passed the legislation 39-20 Thursday night and the state Assembly was expected to follow suit when it reconvenes Friday morning .
Pataki called the gun bill `` historic '' and said he hoped other states and the federal government use it as a blueprint for their efforts to control guns .
The governor said it shows that states can strike the `` appropriate balance '' between protecting the rights of citizens not to be harmed by gun violence and the rights of sportsmen and others who have legitimate reasons to have guns .
`` It 's a great day for New York , '' Pataki said .
The bill 's centerpiece , dubbed the `` Gun DNA '' program by the governor , would require New York handgun dealers and manufacturers who sell to dealers in the state to submit shell casings from the test firing of guns in their inventories to the state police 's forensic lab .
Computerized images of the casings would serve as `` fingerprints '' for firearms and be kept on file .
Authorities would check the database against bullets and casings recovered at scenes of gun violence to track the guns .
The barrels of guns leave telltale markings on bullets and shell casings .
The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of bullet samples for the government , contending that it is a preliminary step toward national gun registration .
The bill would also require any person or firm that sells firearms to provide at the time of sale a trigger locking device .
Businesses selling firearms in New York would also have to post notices regarding the use of trigger locks and safe storage of weapons .
In addition , the measure would ban all assault weapons listed under a 1994 federal law and makes it a Class D violent felony - punishable by up to seven years in prison - to possess or sell any banned assault weapon .
Pataki said the proposal on background checks would close a loophole in the federal Brady Law which requires that gun sales by federally licensed firearms deals must be accompanied by a background check .
Sales at gun shows currently do not require such checks , however , unless the firearms are sold by a federally licensed dealer .
Some Democratic senators who voted in favor of the bill said the legislation did not go far enough , including the provision for a statewide gun licensing program and a child access prevention measure .
The state 's assault weapons ban was also not expanded to include `` post-ban '' weapons , they said .
`` This is a positive step , but we 're doing nothing more than taking the federal definition of weapons .
We 're not dealing with the crime of after-ban weapons , '' said Sen. Richard Dollinger , a Rochester Democrat .
The Republican governor first unveiled the ballistic fingerprinting program and other proposed measures in March .
Most of the provisions have been supported in the past in some form by the Democratic -led Assembly .
But the Republican Senate had not , prior to Thursday , approved any of the anti-gun measures .
Other provisions of the bill include : - A program would be created within the Division of Criminal Justice Services to prevent guns from illegally entering the state .
- All stolen guns would be required by law to be reported to police within 24 hours of discovery .
- Penalties would be established for individuals barred from possessing firearms who illegally attempt to purchase weapons .
Also late Thursday , the state Senate approved a bill that would require a rating system for video games and prohibit access to certain games - especially those depicting lifelike death and injury by the `` firing '' of guns - to youths under 18 .
It would also establish an advisory council on interactive media and youth violence and a parent-teacher anti-violence awareness program and fund .
The sponsor of the bill , Sen. Michael Balboni , R - Nassau , said the current rating systems are inconsistent .
