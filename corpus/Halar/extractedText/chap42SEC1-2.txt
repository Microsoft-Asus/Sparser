GAS EXCHANGE IN ANIMALS

 

 Gas exchange supplies oxygen for cellular respiration and disposes of carbon dioxide: an overview



 

 Gills are respiratory adaptations of most aquatic animals



 

 Tracheal systems and lungs are respiratory adaptations of terrestrial animals



 

 Control centers in the brain regulate the rate and depth of breathing



 

 Gases diffuse down pressure gradients in the lungs and other organs



 

 Respiratory pigments transport gases and help buffer the blood



 

 Deep-diving air-breathers stockpile oxygen and deplete it slowly
