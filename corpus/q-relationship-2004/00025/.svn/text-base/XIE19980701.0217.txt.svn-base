BEIJING , July 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- troops that have been stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -LRB- SAR -RRB- as of July 1 last year have won praise from the SAR government and the local people .
Liu Zhenwu , commander of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison , said that his troops are responsible for defending the `` one country , two systems '' policy and to see that it strictly follows the law .
The PLA Garrison Law exempts servicemen from customs inspections while on duty , but they follow strict rules and pass a security check and examine all vehicles and men , whether on duty or on holiday .
No discipline problems have been reported , even though several thousand officers , enlisted men , and vehicles have been checked .
All officers and enlisted men have two books : the Basic Law and the Garrison Law .
They are required to be familiar with each article of the two laws , and to act in accordance with them .
Because of their rigorous adherence to this , the PLA troops have impressed many Hong Kong residents .
Tung Chee Hwa , chief executive of the HKSAR , said on the eve of the Traditional Spring Festival in early this year that with such disciplined troops responsible for the defence of Hong Kong , the central government , the SAR government and its people can all rest assured .
