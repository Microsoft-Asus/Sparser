KABUL , Afghanistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Afghanistan 's Taliban rulers on Friday ordered a complete ban on growing poppy , the plant from which heroin is made and a major crop in the Central Asian nation .
It was not clear what prompted the order from the Taliban 's Supreme Leader Mullah Mohammed Omar , which was reported on Taliban -run Radio Shariat .
The order comes just two months before planting season for poppy growers in several provinces of Afghanistan , the largest opium-producing nation in the world .
Opium is squeezed from the bulb of the crimson red poppy plant and made into heroin in hundreds of laboratories tucked in the hills of Afghanistan .
Omar threatened stiff penalties for farmers who ignored the ban and said poppy crops would be destroyed , according to Radio Shariat .
`` Whoever grows poppies will be punished severely , '' Omar reportedly said .
No details of punishments were reported .
In the past , the Taliban have refused to implement a complete ban on poppy growing , saying they need international money to help farmers grow alternate crops .
There was no immediate comment from the United Nations , which lauded the Taliban 's orders last year to farmers to reduce production by one-third .
While some farmers adhered to the order , many farmers had a reduced yield only because of the devastating drought which has ravaged much of southern and central Afghanistan .
The Taliban , who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan , have imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law that outlaws most forms of entertainment and imposes strict controls on women .
The northern -based opposition , led by ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani , controls the remaining 10 percent of the country .
