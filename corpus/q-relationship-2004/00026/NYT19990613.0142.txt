MOSCOW --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Russian government could n't do it .
A shadowy British entrepreneur could n't do it .
Now the job of saving Russia 's space station Mir -- the aging , and doomed , symbol of a once-proud space program that was the first to send a man into orbit -- has been given to the Russian people .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In a last-ditch effort to rescue an enduring , if accident-prone , exhibit of Russian national pride , a committee of former astronauts last week opened a special bank account and asked a hard-pressed population to send in their rubles to preserve the 13-year -old space station .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` There is still a chance to save the station , the prestige of the country and the Russian space program , '' the committee said in its appeal for the People 's Charitable Fund to Save the Space Station Mir .
`` The fund appeals to every Russian , to every organization with a call and a plea to keep the Mir station in orbit . ''</ENAMEX>
Strapped for cash , the Russian government this month announced that it would bring the station 's last crew -- its 27th -- back to Earth in August , and prepare the station for unmanned flight , before sending it to a fiery death in Earth 's atmosphere sometime next year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Desperate to keep the Mir afloat , Russian space officials have searched everywhere for financial support .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">They even briefly considered a proposal by a British businessman , posing as a waste-disposal magnate , who offered to pump $ 100 million into the Mir in return for a weeklong joy ride in space .
But that bizarre offer quickly vanished when the businessman -- dubbed the `` English garbage man '' by the Russian press -- was exposed as an international scam artist , known to the police in Pittsburgh and Ohio .
In the end , he skulked away from Star City , the Russian astronaut training center , after being declared unfit for space flight , leaving behind a trail of unpaid bills , the Russian press reported .
Now the task of saving the Mir has been tossed to ordinary Russians , at a time when more than a third of the country is living below the poverty line , when schoolteachers , doctors and army officers are made to wait months for their paychecks .</ENAMEX>
It <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">is too early for any contributions to have landed in the Mir 's special account , but Vitaly Sevastyanov , a former astronaut and a Communist deputy in the Parliament , is banking on the space station 's special appeal as a national symbol .</ENAMEX>
`` It is a symbol because of what it is , '' he said .
`` What is it ?
It is a space station made in the Soviet Union that is continuing to work after the Soviet Union is gone ; it is a symbol of what we could once do . ''
He paused , smoking an Apollo - Soyuz cigarette , a Russian brand named after the famous American - Soviet joint space mission .
`` Then we could build such a station , '' he said .
`` Today we cannot . ''
In the town of Podolsk , outside Moscow , some patriotic businessmen have already signaled their readiness to help .
Alexander Fokin , director of the Podolsk food-processing plant , said the group 's first plan -- formulated in the wake of NATO 's bombing of Belgrade , Yugoslavia -- was to offer financial support for a new generation of Russian ballistic missiles , but he said they were persuaded by parliamentary leaders to focus on the Mir project instead .
Launched in 1986 , the Mir station began as the pride of a triumphant space program , where Soviet and foreign astronauts arrived on regular shuttles , conducting scientific experiments and testing human limits for endurance in space : Astronaut Valery Polyakov holds the record at 438 days .
The Mir station was expanded over the years , but after the collapse of the Soviet Union , the now- Russian program ran into continuous budget problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">To make ends meet , more foreign astronauts were invited to pay their way on board the Mir .
Of the 103 astronauts who flew on the Mir , 41 were Russians and 62 were foreigners , including a Japanese journalist whose television station paid $ 12 million for an exclusive from Mir</ENAMEX> .
If in Russia the Mir is treasured as the reminder of a space program that once was , in the United States it is remembered for a fire , a collision and a series of hair-raising computer malfunctions that took place in 1997 and 1998 , when American astronauts were on board .
That was when Mir became the butt of running gags on late-night talk shows , setting the prototype for images of decrepit Russian spacecraft that later cropped up in Hollywood movies .
Relayed back here on Russian movie screens , those images are typically dismissed as American propaganda and have done little to dim the pride that most Russians , of all political stripes , feel about a space program that in its heyday summed up their country 's scientific prowess and its status as a great power .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The drive to pull the plug on the Mir began several years ago , as the Russian government tried to concentrate its space efforts on Russia 's contribution to the International Space Station .</ENAMEX>
Those efforts -- including the launch of the space module Zvezda now scheduled for November -- have also been plagued by financial difficulties , and while American space officials have stayed away from debates over the continuing viability of the Mir , they have strongly encouraged Moscow to make participation in the new international project a top priority .
But the International Space Station , which will be four times the size of the Mir , could never capture the national imagination the way the Mir did .
`` If and when the Mir is taken down , Russia will lose its independence in manned flights , '' a commentator in the newspaper Sevodnya wrote recently .
`` Whether we want it or not , the international project is a kind of communal flat in space where you have to be considerate of your neighbors . ''
What galls former astronauts like Sevastyanov is that the Mir , having overcome its computer problems , has several good years left .
`` There are 12 tons of scientific equipment on board the Mir , produced by Russia , the United States , France and others , '' Sevastyanov said .
`` It is a treasure trove that should not be thrown away . ''
If the charity drives fall short of the mark -LRB- an estimated $ 20 million is needed to keep a crew on board the Mir until next spring -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Sevastyanov and his committee are already thinking of other ways of saving the station .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">One , he said , would be to `` privatize '' the station , by selling shares to foreign governments , with management kept in the hands of Russia 's Energya rocket corporation .
Another is to wait for Russia 's parliamentary elections in December when , he said , more patriotic-minded deputies may go ahead and vote the money -- estimated at $ 250 million -- to keep the station in orbit for another year .</ENAMEX>
