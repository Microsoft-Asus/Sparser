TOKYO , December 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Japan 's Diet , or parliament , Friday enacted two bills aimed at tightening control of AUM Shinrikyo , which was responsible for the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system , and facilitating redress to the cult 's victims .
The bills , which were approved by the House of Representatives or lower house on November 18 , cleared the House of Councilors -LRB- upper house -RRB- with the support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -LRB- LDP -RRB- and its coalition partners , the Liberal Party -LRB- LP -RRB- and the New Komeito party , as well as the major opposition Democratic Party of Japan -LRB- DPJ -RRB- .
The legislation is expected to take effect on December 27 , two days earlier than originally planned , Japanese government officials said .
One of the bills , submitted by the Japanese government , will allow the Public Security Investigation Agency to regularly supervise or restrict the activities of AUM followers .
The bill does not specifically name AUM , but says the purpose of the legislation is to impose controls on any group whose members have carried out or attempted `` indiscriminate mass-murder , including ones using sarin , during the past 10 years , '' in effect limiting its scope exclusively to AUM. The Japanese government drafted the bill after receiving complaints from local governments , asking for measures against increasing cases of friction between local residents and AUM .
The cult has been trying to expand its presence nationwide and has encountered local resistance in the process .
Many AUM members , including its founder , Shoko Asahara , are on trial or have been found guilty of a series of crimes including the subway gassing which killed 12 people and injured more than 5 , 000 .
The other bill , submitted by the LDP and its two coalition partners , is aimed at facilitating the seizure of AUM 's hidden assets so that they can be distributed to victims of crimes committed by AUM as compensation .
