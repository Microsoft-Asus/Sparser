One obvious benefit of DNA technology and of the Human Genome Project is the identification of genes whose mutation is responsible for genetic diseases, for these discoveries could lead to ways of diagnosing, treating, and perhaps even preventing those conditions.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Equally important are the potential benefits of DNA technology for dealing with other kinds of diseases, from arthritis to AIDS. Susceptibility to many "nongenetic" diseases is influenced by a person’s genes. Furthermore, diseases of all sorts involve changes in gene expression within the affected cells and often within the patient’s immune system. By using DNA micro-array assays or other techniques to compare gene expression in healthy and diseased tissues, researchers hope to find many of the genes that are turned on or off in particular diseases. These genes and their products are potential targets for prevention or therapy.</p><p class="Header3">Diagnosis of Diseases</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">A new Chapter in the diagnosis of infectious diseases has been opened by DNA technology, in particular the use of PCR and labeled nucleic acid probes to track down certain pathogens. For example, because the sequence of HIV DNA is known, PCR can be used to amplify, and thus detect, HIV DNA in blood or tissue samples. This is often the best way to detect an otherwise elusive infection.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Medical scientists can now diagnose hundreds of human genetic disorders using DNA technology. Increasingly, they can identify individuals with genetic diseases before the onset of symptoms, even before birth. It is also possible to identify symptomless carriers of potentially harmful recessive alleles. Genes have been cloned for many human diseases, including hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Hybridization analysis makes it possible to detect abnormal allelic forms of genes present in DNA samples. Even in cases where the gene has not yet been cloned, the presence of an abnormal allele can be diagnosed with reasonable accuracy if a closely linked RFLP marker has been found (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.15</span>). Alleles for Huntington’s disease and a number of other genetic diseases were first detected in this indirect way. The underlying principle is that the closeness of the marker to the gene itself makes it very unlikely that crossing over will occur between the marker and the gene during gamete formation; therefore, the marker and gene will almost always stay together in inheritance. (The same principle obviously applies to all kinds of markers, including the SNPs that may soon come into diagnostic use.) Once a gene is mapped precisely, it can be cloned for study and for use as a probe for finding identical or similar DNA, as is now the case for Huntington’s disease, cystic fibrosis, and many other diseases.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-15','../fig/big/fig20-15.jpg','fig20-15');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-15.jpg" alt="fig20-15" name="myfig20-15"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-15.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">RFLP markers close to a gene.</span> Even if a disease-causing allele has not been cloned and its precise locus is unknown, its presence can sometimes be detected with high (though not perfect) accuracy by testing for the presence of RFLP markers that are very close to the gene in question. This diagram depicts homologous segments of DNA from a family in which some members have a genetic disease. In this family, different versions of a RFLP marker are associated with the different alleles, allowing the test to be applied. If a family member has inherited the version of the RFLP marker with two restriction sites (rather than one), there is a high probability that the individual has also inherited the disease-causing allele.</span></td></tr></table><p class="Header3">Human Gene Therapy</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Techniques for gene manipulating DNA hold great potential for treating a variety of diseases by <span class="Emphasis2">gene therapy</span>--the alteration of an afflicted individual’s genes. In people with disorders traceable to a single defective gene, it should theoretically be possible to replace or supplement the defective gene with a normal allele. The new allele could be inserted into the somatic cells of the tissue affected by the disorder.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">For gene therapy of somatic cells to be permanent, the cells that receive the normal allele must be ones that multiply throughout the patient’s life. Bone marrow cells, which include the <span class="Emphasis1">stem cells</span> that give rise to all the cells of the blood and immune system, are prime candidates. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.16</span> outlines one possible procedure for a situation in which bone marrow cells are failing to produce a vital enzyme because of a single defective gene. Some bone marrow cells are removed from the patient, the normal allele inserted by a viral vector, and the modified cells returned to the patient. If the procedure succeeds, the cells will multiply throughout the patient’s life and express the normal gene. The engineered cells will supply the missing protein, and the patient will be cured.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-16','../fig/big/fig20-16.jpg','fig20-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-16.jpg" alt="fig20-16" name="myfig20-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">One type of gene therapy procedure.</span> A retrovirus vector that has been rendered harmless is used to introduce a normal allele of a gene into the cells of a patient who lacks it. The method takes advantage of the fact that a retrovirus inserts a DNA transcript of its RNA genome into the chromosomal DNA of its host cell (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 18.7</span>). If the viral nucleic acid includes a foreign gene and that gene is expressed, the cell and its descendants will possess the gene product and may be cured. Cells that reproduce throughout life, such as bone marrow cells, are ideal candidates for gene therapy.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">But despite "hype" in the news media over the past decade, there has been very little scientifically strong evidence of effective gene therapy reported. Even when genes are successfully and safely transferred and are being expressed in their new host, their activity typically diminishes after a short period.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">For this reason and because of concerns about safety, most of the current gene therapy trials now under way in humans are not aimed at correcting genetic defects. Instead, researchers are looking for ways to use gene therapy in the fight against major killers such as heart disease and cancer. The most promising trials are those in which a very limited period of activity by the transferred genes is not only sufficient but desirable. For example, one idea is to help treat coronary artery disease by introducing into the heart muscle a gene encoding a growth factor that stimulates new blood vessels to grow around blocked arteries. After success with pigs, two groups of researchers are now carrying out preliminary trials designed to assess safety in humans. One group is using the same vector used in the pig studies: an adenovirus (a major cause of the common cold) modified so it cannot cause disease; the other group is injecting the naked growth factor gene directly into the muscle. The viral vectors are rapidly destroyed by the immune system, and the direct injection method is very inefficient. But the goal is simply to get the heart cells to produce enough growth factor to trigger a brief period of blood vessel growth. Preliminary results are encouraging.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Many technical questions are posed by gene therapy. For example, how can the activity of the transferred gene be controlled so that cells make appropriate amounts of the gene product at the right time and in the right place? How can we be sure that the insertion of the therapeutic gene does not harm some other necessary cell function? Information about DNA control elements from genome sequencing and large-scale gene expression studies that teach us about gene interactions may help answer such questions.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Gene therapy raises some difficult ethical and social questions. Some critics suggest that tampering with human genes in any way, even in somatic cells and even to treat individuals who have life-threatening diseases, is wrong. They argue that it will inevitably lead to the practice of eugenics, a deliberate effort to control the genetic makeup of human populations. Other observers see no fundamental difference between genetic engineering of somatic cells and other conventional medical interventions to save lives. They compare the transplantion of genes to the transplantation of organs.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">The most difficult ethical question is whether we should try to treat human germ-line cells in the hope of correcting the defect in future generations. In laboratory mice at least, transferring foreign genes into the germ line (egg cells) is now a routine procedure. Thus, despite the challenges, it is clear that the technical problems relating to similar genetic engineering in humans will eventually be solved. We will then have to face the question of whether it is advisable, under any circumstances, to alter the genomes of human germ lines or embryos. Should we interfere with evolution in this way? From a biological perspective, the elimination of unwanted alleles from the gene pool could backfire. Genetic variety is a necessary ingredient for the survival of a species as environmental conditions change with time. Genes that are damaging under some conditions may be advantageous under other conditions (one example is the sickle-cell allele, discussed in Chapter 14). Are we willing to risk making genetic changes that could be detrimental to our species in the future? We may have to face this question soon.</p><p class="Header3">Pharmaceutical Products</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">DNA technology has been used to create many useful pharmaceutical products, mostly proteins. By transferring the gene for a desired protein product into a bacterium, yeast, or other kind of cell that is easy to grow in culture, one can produce large quantities of proteins that are present naturally in only minute amounts.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">Using DNA technology to put highly active promoters (and other gene control elements) into vector DNA, scientists create expression vectors that enable the host cell to make large amounts of the product of a gene inserted into the vector. In addition, host cells can be engineered to secrete a protein as it is made, thereby simplifying the task of purifying it by traditional biochemical methods.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">One of the first practical applications of gene splicing was the production of mammalian hormones and other mammalian regulatory proteins in bacteria. Human insulin and human growth hormone (HGH) were among the earliest examples. The insulin produced in this way has greatly benefited the 2 million diabetics in the United States who depend on insulin treatment to control their disease; previously they had to rely on insulin from pigs and cattle, which is not identical to human insulin. Human growth hormone has been a boon to children born with hypopituitarism, a form of dwarfism caused by inadequate amounts of HGH, and may prove to have other uses, such as the healing of injuries.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Another important pharmaceutical product produced by genetic engineering is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). This protein helps dissolve blood clots and reduces the risk of subsequent heart attacks if administered very shortly after an initial attack. However, TPA illustrates a problem with many genetically engineered products: Because the development costs were high and the market is relatively limited, it is expensive.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText">The most recent developments in pharmaceutical products involve truly novel ways to fight certain diseases that do not respond to traditional drug treatments. One approach is the use of genetically engineered proteins that either block or mimic surface receptors on cell membranes. One such experimental drug mimics a receptor protein that HIV binds to in entering white blood cells. The HIV binds to the drug molecules instead and fails to enter the blood cells.</p><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText">For many viral diseases for which there are no effective drug treatments, prevention by vaccination is virtually the only way to fight the disease. A <span class="Emphasis2">vaccine</span> is a harmless variant or derivative of a pathogen that stimulates the immune system to fight the pathogen. Traditional vaccines for viral diseases are of two types: particles of a virulent virus that have been inactivated by chemical or physical means, and active virus particles of an attenuated (nonpathogenic) viral strain. In both cases, the virus particles are similar enough to the active pathogen to trigger an immune response (see Chapter 43).</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText">Recombinant DNA techniques can generate large amounts of a specific protein molecule normally found on the surface of a pathogen. If the protein, referred to as a subunit, is one that triggers an immune response against the intact pathogen, then it can be used as a vaccine. Alternatively, genetic engineering methods can be used to modify the genome of the pathogen to attenuate it. A vaccine consisting of an attenuated microbe is often more effective than a subunit vaccine because it usually triggers a greater response by the immune system. Pathogens attenuated by gene-splicing techniques may be safer than the natural mutants traditionally used.</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText">A completely new development in the use of recombinant DNA technology by the pharmaceutical industry is the genetic modification of plants to produce vaccines and rare human proteins of medical importancee. We’ll discuss this application, often called "pharming," in the next section.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
