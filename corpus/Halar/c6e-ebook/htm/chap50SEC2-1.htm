What factors limit the geographic range, or <span class="Emphasis1">distribution</span>, of a species? And what factors determine its <span class="Emphasis1">abundance</span>? Given a hypothesis, or suggested explanation, for one of these questions, ecologists make predictions of what should be observed in nature or what the outcome of an experiment should be. In some cases, they can devise mathematical models that enable them to simulate the possible results of large-scale experiments that are impossible to conduct in the field. In this approach, important variables and their hypothetical relationships are described through mathematical equations. The potential ways in which the variables interact can then be studied. For example, many ecologists and climatologists use sophisticated computer programs to develop models that predict the effects that human activities will have on climate and how the resulting climatic changes will affect geographic distributions of life-forms during the next century. Of course, such simulations are only as good as the basic information on which the models are based, and obtaining that information requires extensive laboratory work and fieldwork.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig50-1','../fig/big/fig50-1.jpg','fig50-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig50-1.jpg" alt="fig50-1" name="myfig50-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 50-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Distribution and abundance of the red kangaroo in Australia, based on aerial surveys.</span> This kangaroo species occurs throughout arid regions of the continent.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The environment of any organism includes <span class="Emphasis2">abiotic components</span> (nonliving chemical and physical factors), such as temperature, light, water, and nutrients, and <span class="Emphasis2">biotic</span> (living) <span class="Emphasis2">components</span>--all the organisms that are part of any individual’s environment.
