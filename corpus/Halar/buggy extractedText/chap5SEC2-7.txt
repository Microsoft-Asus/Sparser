 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones

Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings (FIGURE 5.14). Different steroids vary in the functional groups attached to this ensemble of rings. One steroid, cholesterol, is a common component of animal cell membranes and is also the precursor from which other steroids are synthesized. Many hormones, including vertebrate sex hormones, are steroids produced from cholesterol (see FIGURE 4.8). Thus, cholesterol is a crucial molecule in animals, although a high level of it in the blood may contribute to atherosclerosis.
