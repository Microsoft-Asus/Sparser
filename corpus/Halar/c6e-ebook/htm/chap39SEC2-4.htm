(<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.17</span> illustrates phototropism as an example.) The biochemical identity of the blue-light photoreceptor was so elusive that in the 1970s plant physiologists began to refer to this putative receptor as cryptochrome (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">kryptos</span>, hidden, and <span class="Emphasis1">chrom</span>, pigment). In the 1990s, molecular biologists analyzing <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> mutants found that plants actually use at least three completely different types of pigments to detect blue light: <span class="Emphasis2">cryptochromes</span> (for the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation), <span class="Emphasis2">phototropin</span> (for phototropism), and a carotenoid-based photoreceptor called <span class="Emphasis2">zeaxanthin</span> (for stomatal opening).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-17','../fig/big/fig39-17.jpg','fig39-17');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-17.jpg" alt="fig39-17" name="myfig39-17"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-17.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Action spectrum for blue-light-stimulated phototropism.
