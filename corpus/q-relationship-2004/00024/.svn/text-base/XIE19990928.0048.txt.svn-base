ATHENS , September 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Monday that Greece would be prepared to start dialogue with neighboring Turkey on the remaining `` high-impact '' issues if the two countries could sign cooperation agreements on the `` low-impact '' issues such as tourism , trade and culture .
In an interview with the Athens daily `` Ta Nea '' , Papandreou said that the recent improvement of the climate in Greek - Turkish relations could not have negative efforts on the Cyprus issue , while the expansion of the `` low-impact '' Greek - Turkish dialogue to other secondary issues in no way meant that Greece had shelved the Cyprus problem .
He added that the Cyprus government also regarded the recent Greek - Turkish rapprochement as particularly positive .
The minister noted that the present conjuncture was unique for enabling progress in the Cyprus problem and the U.S. would move actively in that direction .
As for Turkey 's accession to the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- , Papandreou said that Turkey 's future EU membership would be in Greece 's long-term interests , but Greece 's position at December 's EU summit hinged on Turkey 's attitude on Greek - Turkish affairs and the Cyprus issue and on the Guarantees Greece would secure from the EU on its national interests .
Relations between Greece and Turkey , both NATO members , have been strained for decades over their disputes in the territorial waters , air space limits , the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem .
In recent months , the two neighbors , which have nearly gone to war three times in the past 25 years , have been trying hard to improve their relations with the start of low-level talks between senior Turkish foreign ministry officials , but they have not touched the sensitive issues such as territorial disputes and the Cyprus problem .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The earthquakes in Turkey and Greece also provided an opportunity for both sides to show their willingness to better bilateral time</ENAMEX> .
Rescue crews from Greece and Turkey have fought side-by-side in pulling earthquake survivors out of the rubble of the collapsed buildings in both countries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The progress made in the talks and the good feeling generated by mutual help over the earthquake tragedies are hoped to pave the way for both sides to eventually better their bilateral ties</ENAMEX> .
