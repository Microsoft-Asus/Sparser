 Nervous systems perform the three overlapping functions of sensory input, integration, and motor output

In general, a nervous system has three overlapping functions: sensory input, integration, and motor output (FIGURE 48.1). Sensory receptors, such as the light-detecting cells in the eyes, collect information about the physical world outside the body as well as processes inside the organism; this sensory input is then conveyed to integration centers. Integration is the process by which the input is interpreted and associated with appropriate responses of the body. The circular arrow in FIGURE 48.1 indicates that integration is a continuous background activity. For the most part, integration is carried out in the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord in vertebrates. Motor output is the conduction of signals from the integration center, the CNS, to effector cells, the muscle cells or gland cells that actually carry out the body's responses to stimuli. The signals are conducted by nerves, ropelike bundles of extensions of neurons tightly wrapped in connective tissue. The nerves that communicate motor and sensory signals between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are collectively called the peripheral nervous system (PNS). From receptor to effector, information is communicated along a pathway of neurons by a combination of electrical and chemical signals. In this chapter we concentrate on communication within the nervous system. Chapter 49 connects the nervous system to its inputs and outputs by discussing sensory receptors and the physiology of movement.
