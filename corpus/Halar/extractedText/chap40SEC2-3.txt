 The organ systems of an animal are interdependent

In all but the simplest animals (sponges and some cnidarians), different tissues are organized into organs. In some organs the tissues are arranged in layers. For example, the vertebrate stomach has four major tissue layers (FIGURE 40.5). A thick epithelium lines the lumen and secretes mucus and digestive juices into it. Outside this layer is a zone of connective tissue, surrounded by a thick layer of smooth muscle. Yet another layer of connective tissue encapsulates the entire stomach.

Fig 40-5. Tissue layers of the stomach, a digestive organ. The wall of the stomach and other tubular organs of the digestive system has four main tissue layers.

Many of the organs of vertebrates are suspended by sheets of connective tissue called mesenteries in body cavities moistened or filled with fluid. Mammals have a thoracic cavity housing the lungs and heart that is separated from the lower abdominal cavity by a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm.

A level of organization higher than organs, organ systems carry out the major body functions of most animals (TABLE 40.1, p. 840). Each organ system consists of several organs and has specific functions, but the efforts of all systems must be coordinated for the animal to survive. For instance, nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract are distributed throughout the body by the circulatory system. But the heart that pumps blood through the circulatory system depends on nutrients absorbed by the digestive tract and also on oxygen (O2) obtained from the air or water by the respiratory system. Any organism, whether single-celled or an assembly of organ systems, is a coordinated living whole greater than the sum of its parts.
