MEXICO CITY
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The Mexican attorney general 's office is investigating whether the brother of a former president and a former top prosecutor had ties to the Juarez drug cartel .
A former federal police director who has admitted taking bribes from the cartel has implicated ex-prosecutor Mario Ruiz Massieu and other officials , Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar told reporters Sunday .
He said his office is investigating whether there is evidence to back up the accusations .
Asked if Raul Salinas de Gortari , brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , also was named , Madrazo Cuellar said `` not directly , '' but that investigators wanted to see if he was involved .
Raul Salinas has been jailed on illegal enrichment charges and on charges that he masterminded the murder of Ruiz Massieu 's brother , Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , a governing-party official .
Mario Ruiz Massieu is under house arrest in New Jersey while Mexican authorities try to extradite him on charges that he covered up Raul Salinas ' role in his brother 's killing .
Last year , the U.S. government won a jury verdict allowing it to seize dlrs 7.9 million from dlrs 9 million Ruiz Massieu had in bank accounts in Texas , claiming the money came from drug traffickers .
Both Salinas and Ruiz Massieu have maintained their innocence .
The former police director , Adrian Carrera Fuentes , was sentenced Wednesday to four years in prison on charges that he tortured a suspect in the Ruiz Massieu killing .
He still faces money-laundering charges related to the bribes he accepted from the cartel .
The Juarez drug cartel was considered the most powerful in Mexico but has declined since its leader , Amado Carrillo Fuentes , died after plastic surgery last year .
