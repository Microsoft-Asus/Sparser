Another specialized transport protein, separate from the pump, can couple the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of hydrogen ions generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One specific transport protein couples the return of hydrogen ions to the transport of sucrose into the cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 8.18</span>). The protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The sucrose rides on the coattails of the hydrogen ion, which uses the common transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the concentration gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use the mechanism of sucrose-H<SUP>+</SUP> cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into specialized cells in the veins of leaves. The sugar can then be distributed by the vascular tissue of the plant to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig8-18','../fig/big/fig8-18.jpg','fig8-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig8-18.jpg" alt="fig8-18" name="myfig8-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 8-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Cotransport.</span> An ATP-driven pump stores energy by concentrating a substance (here H<SUP>+</SUP>) on one side of the membrane. As the substance leaks back across the membrane through specific transport proteins, it escorts other substances (here sucrose) into the cell. In this case, the proton pump of the membrane is indirectly driving sucrose uptake by a plant cell with the help of a protein that cotransports the two solutes.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
