NUCLEIC ACIDS--INFORMATIONAL POLYMERS

 

 Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information



 

 A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides



 

 Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix



 

 We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution



If the primary structure of polypeptides determines the conformation of a protein, what determines primary structure? The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a unit of inheritance known as a gene. Genes consist of DNA, which is a polymer belonging to the class of compounds known as nucleic acids.
