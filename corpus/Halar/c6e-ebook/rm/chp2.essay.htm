									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">Female silkworm moths <span class="Emphasis1">(Bombyx mori)</span> attract males by emitting chemical signals that spread through the air. A male hundreds of meters away can detect these molecules and fly toward their source. The sensory organs responsible for this behavior are the comblike antennae visible in the photograph here. Each filament of an antenna is equipped with thousands of receptor cells that detect the sex attractant. Based on what you learned in this chapter, propose a hypothesis to account for the ability of the male moth to detect a specific molecule in the presence of many other molecules in the air. What predictions does your hypothesis make? Design an experiment to test one of these predictions.</p>

									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">While waiting at an airport, Neil Campbell once overhead this claim: "It’s paranoid and ignorant to worry about industry or agriculture contaminating the environment with their chemical wastes. After all, this stuff is just made of the same atoms that were already present in our environment." How would you counter this argument?</p>
