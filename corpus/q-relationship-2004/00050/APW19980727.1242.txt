BOGOTA , Colombia

A jailed Cali cartel kingpin tipped authorities off to the whereabouts of his wheelchair-bound half brother , who was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking .
The army seized Jose Manuel Herrera on Monday at a northern Bogota apartment .
He is wanted by prosecutors on charges of illegal enrichment and money laundering .
Herrera is the half-brother of Elmer `` Pacho '' Herrera , once the Cali cartel 's third-ranking member who was arrested in 1996 and is serving a six-year prison term in Colombia .
The jailed kingpin turned in his half brother in return for an undisclosed sentence reduction , said a spokesman for the Cali public prosecutor 's office who requested anonymity .
The spokesman said Jose Manuel Herrera was paralyzed in a traffic accident in New York City .
The suspect 's age was not given .
Police earlier this month arrested `` Pacho '' Herrera 's cousin , Pedro Nel Herrera , and said they suspected he was linked to a 7-ton U.S. -bound cocaine shipment seized July 11 in the Caribbean port city of Cartagena .
Most of the leaders of the Cali cartel have been killed or captured , but the flow of cocaine out of Colombia has remained constant and is now smuggled by smaller , more discrete organizations .
