Much of the diversity of fungi we observe today may have had its phylogenetic origin in adaptive radiation when life began to colonize land. The oldest undisputed fossils of fungi date back 460 million years, about the time plants began to colonize land. Fossils of the first vascular plants from the late Silurian period have petrified mycorrhizae. Plants probably moved onto land in the company of fungi.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Molecular evidence supports the widely held view that the four fungal divisions are monophyletic (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.4</span>). The occurrence of flagella in the chytrids, representing the oldest lineage of fungi, indicates that fungal ancestors were aquatic flagellated organisms. Flagellated cells were probably lost in the chytrid lineage that led to the Zygomycota, as ancestral fungi became increasingly adapted for life on land. Many of the differences among the phyla Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota represent different solutions to the problem of reproducing and dispersing on land. These fungi may have diverged during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
