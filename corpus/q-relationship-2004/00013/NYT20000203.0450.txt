WASHINGTON --
Wading into a growing political debate already tinged by accusations of racism and special treatment , the director of central intelligence , George Tenet , dismissed comparisons Thursday between the way the government had responded to evidence of computer security lapses by a former director who lost his security clearance and by a nuclear scientist who is in jail waiting trial .
Tenet told a Senate panel that while John Deutch , his predecessor , was `` sloppy '' in his handling of classified documents , there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a foreign country by handing over American secrets .
By contrast , Tenet noted that the scientist , Wen Ho Lee , had been charged with downloading and copying files containing nuclear secrets with the intention of aiding a foreign country and damaging national security .
`` I actually think there is a great difference in the two cases , '' Tenet said at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
`` In both cases there was a referral made to the Department of Justice .
In one case the Department of Justice declined any action , in the case of the director .
In the case of Wen Ho Lee there is an indictment pending .
`` In one instance there is an intent to do harm to the United States -- that 's a legal judgment that 's been made .
In the other instance , a similar legal judgment was not made .
That 's not to say that this case involving the former director is not serious . ''
Tenet was responding to pointed questioning from Sen. Wayne Allard , R - Colo. , who asked why the two were being treated so differently , a question that is being repeated by Lee 's supporters as he awaits trial in New Mexico .
Lee , a former scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , was arrested in December and accused of downloading and copying the secret files onto portable computer tapes , some of which are now missing .
While the government has not charged him with espionage , prosecutors say they can prove that he took the secret information with the intent to aid a foreign country .
Deutch , by contrast , was the subject of an internal CIA investigation after officials learned that he had placed classified documents on CIA -owned computers at his home , but the Justice Department decided not to prosecute him in April 1999 .
Last August , after the agency 's inspector general office completed its investigation of the case , Tenet suspended Deutch 's security clearances indefinitely .
Asked at a news conference Thursday about the impression of a double standard , Attorney General Janet Reno said : `` I ca n't comment with respect to the Wen Ho Lee case , because that is a pending matter .
But each case speaks for itself , based on the evidence and the law , and a judgment has to be made , based on the evidence in that particular case . ''
The different outcomes in the two cases has helped fuel charges of racism and selective prosecution by Lee 's supporters .
They argue that the Taiwan -born scientist had been singled out because of his ethnicity as the government investigated evidence that China had stolen U.S. nuclear secrets .
Government investigators strongly deny that Lee was the victim of racism .
But accusations made by the intelligence inspector general that some senior agency officials took actions that led to a delay of a thorough investigation in the Deutch case have only intensified the debate over the way the two cases have been handled .
Allard argued that there did seem to be parallels between the Deutch and Lee cases , saying both had `` made similar mistakes in the fact that they both had information that was very important to this country on unsecured computers . ''
But Tenet said that while Deutch was writing and creating classified documents on unsecured computers so he could work at home , his actions did not compare to Lee 's efforts to download and copy secret data on U.S. nuclear warheads from the classified computer system at Los Alamos .
Separately , Tenet provided the Senate panel with a broad review of global threats facing the United States , including terrorism .
He said that U.S. intelligence officials believe that Osama bin Laden , charged in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa , had developed new tactics to try to strike U.S. interests with his terrorist network .
Bin Laden , a Saudi exile , is now living in Afghanistan .
Tenet said the United States believed that bin Laden 's terrorist organization , along with other terrorist groups , were now `` placing increased emphasis on developing surrogates to carry out attacks in an effort to avoid detection . ''
He said , for example , that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization `` is closely linked to bin Laden 's organization and his operatives located around the world , including Europe , Yemen , Pakistan , Lebanon and Afghanistan . ''
Tenet also said : `` There is now an intricate web of alliances among Sunni extremists worldwide , including North Africans , radical Palestinians , Pakistanis and Central Asians .
`` Some of these terrorists are actively sponsored by national governments that harbor great antipathy for the United States .
Iran for one remains the most active state sponsor . ''
