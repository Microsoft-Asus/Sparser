For a given character, the gene takes its symbol from the first mutant (non-wild type) discovered. For example, the allele for white eyes in <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> is symbolized by <span class="Emphasis1">w</span>. A superscript + identifies the allele for the wild-type trait--for red eyes, <span class="Emphasis1">w</span><SUP>+</SUP>. Gene nomenclature differs somewhat with the type of organism. For example, the symbols for human genes are usually written in all capitals, as in <span class="Emphasis1">HD,</span> the Huntington’s disease gene. Depending on the context, a symbol like <span class="Emphasis1">HD</span> or <span class="Emphasis1">w</span> can refer specifically to a mutant allele or to the gene in general.</body></html>
