VIENNA , Austria --
After two days of disputes , OPEC decided on Wednesday to increase oil production without the participation of its second-largest producer , Iran .
But the announced increase was not what the United States had pressed for , and was not expected to bring down gasoline prices anytime soon .
In a rare break in the solidarity of its ranks , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that nine of its 11 members would raise production by a total of 1.45 million barrels a day , despite bitter opposition from Iran to any increase .
With Iran , the total would have been about 1.7 million barrels , but analysts said the actual increase would end up at the higher level because other OPEC members were likely to seize the opportunity to cheat on their quotas to fill the gap left by Iran .
The production of Iraq is governed separately by U.N. resolutions since the Persian Gulf war .
The United States had pressed for increases of up to 2.5 million barrels a day to reduce gasoline prices , which have soared to an average of about $ 1.60 a gallon in most cities .
Iran 's irritation at the American pressures was apparently a major reason behind its opposition to any increase .
But experts estimated that it would take at least six to eight weeks before any increase in oil production finds its way to the gasoline pumps , and with inventories already unusually low in the United States ahead of the summer driving season , gasoline prices will not soon decline .
In fact , some analysts predicted , they would rise still more before easing in the fall .
`` Anybody who expects to get back to gasoline at $ 1 or $ 1.20 a gallon will be seriously disappointed , '' said Raad Alkadiri , an analyst at Petroleum Finance Co. , an industry research firm based in Washington .
`` Whatever happens , you 're going to have a tight gasoline market this summer . ''
The unusual break in OPEC ranks came after two days of wrangling between Iran and Saudi Arabia , the largest producer , which pushed for an increase in production .
The fissure has major implications for the United States , which has waged a heavy lobbying campaign to persuade OPEC members on the need for a substantial increase .
The battle within OPEC was as much political as economic , and much of the debate was over whether the group would be capitulating to pressure from the United States for lower oil prices .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">It was OPEC 's decision to cut production last year , joined in by several non- OPEC nations like Mexico and Norway , that sent oil and gasoline prices soaring to their highest levels in years</ENAMEX> .
Wednesday 's fissure could severely damage OPEC 's discipline and credibility , just as the organization seemed to have regained some of the power it had during the 1970s and early 1980s .
Iran 's oil minister , Bijan Namdar Zangeneh , accused the other OPEC countries of trying to ram through decisions that were not justified by economic conditions .
`` OPEC is not an organization to rubberstamp the decisions already made , '' Zangeneh said in a short but biting statement about 1 a.m .
Wednesday morning .
`` We tried to show our flexibility , '' he continued .
`` OPEC needs a spirit of compromise which unfortunately we did n't trace at this time . ''
If OPEC 's discipline does come unhinged , the United States could be a major beneficiary by seeing its bill for imported oil drop dramatically .
Wednesday 's split comes after a bitter test of wills between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which was determined to reverse last year 's price cuts and allow the price of oil settle at about $ 25 a barrel , compared to about $ 27.50 today and its recent high of $ 34 in early March .
Much of the battle within OPEC was about whether countries could or would be seen as capitulating to heavy-handed American demands .
Saudi officials adamantly wanted to raise prices , in part because the United States is its biggest market and in part because of concern about political wrath from Congress , where some lawmakers have pushed for legislation to block aid and sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia .
Iranian leaders , on the other hand , had angrily denounced American demands and insisted that OPEC should not decide in response to political pressure .
Perhaps more important , Iran had nothing to gain from an increase in total production .
Analysts , as well as Saudi leaders , argued here that Iran is already producing virtually all the oil it can pump , about 3 million barrels a day .
As a result , any increase in production would come from other countries _Saudi Arabia in particular -- and merely lead to lower prices for what Iran was already selling .
Saudi Arabia with daily output of 7.6 million barrels , has enough spare capacity to flood world markets in a matter of weeks .
Saudi officials , alarmed when prices suddenly surged recently to around $ 30 a barrel , adamantly demanded an increase in OPEC output that would prevent worldwide shortages and stabilize prices .
The Clinton administration has been lobbying OPEC leaders intensively for the last several weeks , arguing that the world markets needed as much as 2.5 million extra barrels a day to meet demand and to restore depleted inventories .
It has been clear that OPEC would not go that far , but Saudi Arabia had managed to convinced all other members except Iran to reverse the cuts that had imposed on themselves last year .
Even with the agreement on Wednesday , many OPEC leaders were still fuming about what they view as heavy-handed pressure from Washington that only made their own political situation more awkward .
Venezuelan leaders , taking a cue from their president , Hugo Chavez , have been particularly sensitive about being portrayed as puppets of the American government , and went out of their way last week to criticize lobbying efforts by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson .
Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of crude oil to the United States .
