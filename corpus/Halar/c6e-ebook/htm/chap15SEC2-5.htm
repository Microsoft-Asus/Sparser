Sturtevant, to a method for constructing a <span class="Emphasis2">genetic map,</span> an ordered list of the genetic loci along a particular chromosome.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Sturtevant hypothesized that recombination frequencies calculated from experiments like the one in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.5</span> reflect the distances between genes on a chromosome. Assuming that the chance of crossing over is approximately equal at all points on a chromosome, he predicted that the farther apart two genes are, the higher the probability that a crossover will occur between them and therefore the higher the recombination frequency. His reasoning was simple: The greater the distance between two genes, the more points there are between them where crossing over can occur. With this idea in mind, Sturtevant began using recombination data from fruit fly crosses to assign to genes relative positions on chromosomes--that is, to <span class="Emphasis1">map</span> genes. A genetic map based on recombination frequencies is specifically called a <span class="Emphasis2">linkage map.</span></p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.6</span> shows Sturtevant’s map of three genes relative to each other, the body-color <span class="Emphasis1">(b)</span> and wing-size <span class="Emphasis1">(vg)</span> genes depicted in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.5</span> and a third gene on the same chromosome, called cinnabar <span class="Emphasis1">(cn).</span> Cinnabar is one of many <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> genes affecting eye color. Cinnabar eyes, a mutant phenotype, are a brighter red than the wild-type color. The recombination frequency between <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> is 9% , and the recombination frequency between <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> is 9.5% . In other words, crossovers between <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> and between <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> are only about half as frequent as crossovers between <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> (17% ). Only a map that locates <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> about midway between <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> is consistent with the data (as you can prove to yourself by drawing alternative maps). Sturtevant expressed the distances between genes in <span class="Emphasis2">map units,</span> defining one map unit as equivalent to a 1%  recombination frequency. Today, the word <span class="Emphasis1">centimorgan</span> is often used, in honor of Morgan.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig15-6','../fig/big/fig15-6.jpg','fig15-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig15-6.jpg" alt="fig15-6" name="myfig15-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 15-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Using recombination frequencies to construct a genetic map.</span> The method for making this type of map, called a linkage map, is based on the assumption that the probability of a crossover between two genetic loci is proportional to the distance separating the loci. In this example of a linkage map, re-combination frequencies have been used to locate three <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> genes: <span class="Emphasis1">b, vg,</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">cn.</span> The data best fit a sequence with <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> positioned about halfway between the other two genes.

The frequency of recombination measured between such genes can have a maximum value of 50% , a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes. In fact, the seven characters that Mendel studied in his peas are not all on separate chromosomes, although the pea coincidentally has seven chromosome pairs. Seed color and flower color, for instance, are now known to be on chromosome 1. But they are so far apart on that chromosome that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. Genes located far apart on a chromosome are mapped by adding the recombination frequencies from crosses involving each of the distant genes and a number of genes lying between them. Only for one pair of the genes Mendel studied, the genes for plant height and pod shape, do modern biologists observe linkage. Although Mendel observed segregation of alleles for each of these characters in monohybrid crosses, he did not report the results of dihybrid crosses for this particular combination of characters.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Even when the distance between genetic loci on a chromosome is not great enough to "unlink" them, it may be great enough to create a significant likelihood of more than one crossover between the loci. A second crossover "cancels out" the first and thus reduces the observed number of recombinant offspring. Multiple crossovers are the main reason for the numerical discrepancy in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.6</span>, where the recombination frequency between <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> is less than the sum of the <span class="Emphasis1">b</span>-<span class="Emphasis1">cn</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">cn</span>-<span class="Emphasis1">vg</span> frequencies.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Using crossover data, Sturtevant and his colleagues were able to map the other identified <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> genes in linear arrays. They found that the genes clustered into four groups of linked genes. Because microscopists had found four pairs of chromosomes in <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> cells, this clustering of genes was additional evidence that genes are located on chromosomes. Each chromosome has a linear array of specific gene loci (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.7</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig15-7','../fig/big/fig15-7.jpg','fig15-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig15-7.jpg" alt="fig15-7" name="myfig15-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 15-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A partial genetic map of a <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> chromosome.</span> This simplified map shows just a few of the genes that have been mapped on <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span> chromosome II.

The frequency of crossing over is not actually uniform over the length of the chromosome, and therefore map units do not have absolute size (in nanometers, for instance). Thus, a linkage map portrays the sequence of genes along a chromosome, but it does not give the precise locations of genes. Other methods enable geneticists to construct <span class="Emphasis2">cytological maps</span> of chromosomes, which locate genes with respect to chromosomal features, such as stained bands, that can be seen in the microscope (see FIGURE 15.14). The ultimate genetic maps, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 20, show the distances between gene loci in DNA nucleotides. Comparing a linkage map with this type of map (or even with a cytological map) of the same chromosome, we find that the sequence of genes matches, but the spacing between them does not.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
