JERUSALEM
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Palestinian economy has grown over the past two years , a U.N. report said Sunday , with higher wages and more people working at home and in Israel .
Investment and exports have stagnated , however , partly due to concerns abroad about corruption and the Palestinian Authority 's political future .
The growth rate in 1998 was 4.1 percent , and the 1999 figure is expected to reach 4.5 percent after adjustment for inflation , U.N. Special Coordinator Terje Roed - Larsen , the report 's author , said in a statement .
In 1999 , more than 47,000 new jobs were created , unemployment fell , and the average wage rose .
The number of Palestinians employed in Israel also increased by 18 percent to over 122,000 , about half of them with Israeli work permits and the rest working illegally .
Over the past few months , Israel has relaxed regulations to give work permits to thousands more Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank .
Six out of every 10 new jobs , however , were in the domestic Palestinian economy , which employed an average of 410,000 workers in the first six months of 1999 .
Other indicators pointed to stagnation .
`` There was little or no improvement in private investment and exports , the two most critical variables for sustainable private sector-led employment growth , '' the report said .
This was attributed to political uncertainty about the nature of a final peace treaty with Israel , due by September , and to `` the still weak legal and institutional environment , particularly from the point of view of foreign capital '' in the Palestinian Authority .
The report also noted a downward trend in public investment due to a drop in contributions by donor countries .
Donor countries have expressed concern about corruption in the Palestinian Authority and the lack of transparency in its financial administration .
