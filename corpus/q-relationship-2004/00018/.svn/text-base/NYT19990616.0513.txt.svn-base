WASHINGTON --
Two weeks before North Korean and South Korean gunboats opened fire on each other in disputed waters , former Defense Secretary William Perry spent three days in the North trying to get a government known for its paranoia to build a relationship with Washington .
During 15 hours of talks , Perry laid out a plan in which President Clinton would lift economic sanctions gradually in return for commitments from North Korea to stop testing missiles and selling missile technology , and to expand a freeze on nuclear-weapons development .
The North Koreans were suspicious , a member of Perry 's party said , suspecting a trap .
But they were also intrigued , and ended the visit with a banquet and floor show in which performers entertained Perry with a mix of Korean revolutionary songs and American tunes , including `` Oh !
Susanna . ''
Now , only two weeks later , Perry 's detailed proposals for reconciliation are already in deep trouble -- perhaps a casualty of the outbreak of shooting this week that resulted in the deaths of at least 20 North Koreans .
`` It 's very damaging , '' said Donald Gregg , a former American ambassador to South Korea who heads the Korea Society in New York .
`` And like everything the North Koreans do , no one is entirely sure why they did it . ''
Republicans in Congress were suspicious of Perry 's initiative even before the confrontation , and several emerged from a classified briefing last week noting that the North had indicated no willingness to give up its ballistic missile program .
Some hard-liners , led by Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman of New York , had already introduced legislation that would tie Clinton 's hands , preventing him from lifting sanctions and blocking further aid to the North until it makes major concessions .
`` This latest incident fit the standard model for North Korean negotiations , '' Gilman said Wednesday in an interview .
`` They create a crisis .
Then they demand concessions in return for backing down .
The Perry report , if and when we get it , should take into account this kind of brinksmanship . ''
It is unclear when Perry will formally issue a report , or in what form .
While Clinton and the national security adviser , Sandy Berger , have reportedly approved the strategy , the White House played down Perry 's mission and , so far , has offered no public support for his proposals .
In fact , administration officials have refused to discuss his overtures to the North in public , saying they fear that would undercut delicate diplomacy with a volatile regime .
Even within the Clinton administration , there is growing skepticism that the North Koreans will take the deal , or that Congress will go along .
`` Every time the North Koreans do something defiant or something stupid , all it does is harden the view that they could never be trusted to execute whatever deal we strike , '' a senior administration official involved in Korea policy said this week .
`` If you think ` engagement ' is a hard sell with China , try it with North Korea . ''
This week 's gun battle on the seas off the Korean Peninsula was particularly unsettling to the administration because it clearly was more than a confrontation among hot-headed captains .
It was preceded by a standoff that lasted several days , as South Korean ships tried to push the North 's vessels , chiefly fishing craft seeking crabs , back into Northern territory .
`` There was plenty of time for North Korea 's military leadership to tell them to back off , '' said an official familiar with the intelligence gathered from American and South Korean aircraft over the area .
`` But clearly they wanted to send a message that they were not about to back down . ''
After the sinking of the North Korean torpedo boat , however , Pyongyang did back off , clearly calculating that they were outgunned .
Equally interesting , the South Koreans backed off as well , and President Kim Dae Jung , who arrives here next month for his second visit to Washington , said he would not retreat from his `` sunshine policy '' of expanded contacts with the North Koreans .
`` It was a sign of a growing maturity on the part of South Korea , '' said Gregg , whose long career with Korea included a tour as the CI A 's station chief there during other moments of tension with North Korea .
`` There is a confidence among the South Koreans we did not used to see . ''
That confidence , however , is no assurance that Kim 's policy or Perry 's congruent initiative will sell .
The Perry effort hinges on what a State Department official Wednesday called `` a broad vision of what a new relationship with North Korea could look like . ''
At its core would be a series of commitments by the North , each verifiable by inspections or American spy satellites , to halt several projects that North Korean leaders have said are important to their national or economic security .
First would be an end to the testing of missiles , including the medium-range missile that was launched over Japan last summer .
Pyongyang would also have to end its export of missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan , one of its few sources of hard currency .
It would also have to expand on the 1994 nuclear accord , allowing broader inspections to dispel fears that it has simply moved its nuclear-weapons projects to sites outside Yongbyon , the frozen nuclear complex where that research was located .
`` We did n't go there with the idea that they would say , ` Great idea .
Where do we sign up ? ' '' said the State Department official .
`` But they also listened very intently , asked a lot of questions , took copious notes . ''
Most of Perry 's interactions were with Kang Sok Ju , the country 's first vice foreign minister , who is regarded by American intelligence officials as the civilian official closest to President Kim Jong Il , the son of the North 's late founder , Kim Il Sung .
President Kim declined to meet with Perry , though American officials believe that he read a letter from Clinton that the American delegation carried .
The contents have not been made public .
Perry also met with Lt. Gen. Li Yong Chol , the director of the national defense commission .
Presumably , Li was in the chain of command as North Korean forces engaged in Tuesday 's firefight with the South .
