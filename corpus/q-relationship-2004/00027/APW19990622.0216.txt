-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The risk of mad cow-type disease breaking out among people in the United States is small , researchers say .</ENAMEX>
The government has taken steps to ban beef imports from Europe and to protect domestic herds from consuming ground-up sheep and other feed that may spread the fatal brain illness , according to a report in Wednesday 's Journal of the American Medical Association .
The article , based on data collected by a research team led by JAMA staffer Litjen Tan , said unique circumstances existed in Britain in the late 1980s when an epidemic began that lasted through 1996 .
Ground -up sheep were fed to cattle in Britain , and safeguards on livestock feed and restrictions on infected animals were not in place , the researchers said .
Mad cow disease kills by eating holes in the brain tissue of cattle .
As of Jan. 31 , a human variant , called Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , had showed up in 39 Britons who apparently ate beef contaminated with mad cow disease .
There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle , Tan 's group said in the year -old report .
`` Any potential human contact with the disease agent would have to come from the importation of contaminated cattle products or exposure while traveling '' in countries that have the disease , the researchers said .
A critic of the beef industry said the report is `` falsely reassuring . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Stauber , executive director of the Center for Media & Democracy and co-author of `` Mad Cow U.S.A. , '' said a mad cow-like disease has appeared in deer and elk in Western states .</ENAMEX>
Michael Hansen of the Consumers Union of Yonkers , N.Y. , said that deer and elk can be used in livestock feed .
