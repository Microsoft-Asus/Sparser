WASHINGTON --
A scientist suspected of spying for China improperly transferred huge amounts of secret data from a computer system at a government laboratory , compromising virtually every nuclear weapon in the United States arsenal , government and lab officials say .
The data -- millions of lines of computer code that approximate how this country 's atomic warheads work -- were downloaded from a computer system at the Los Alamos , N.M. , weapons lab that is open only to those with top-level security clearances , according to the officials .
The scientist , Wen Ho Lee , then transferred the files to a widely accessible computer network at the lab , where they were stored under other file names , the officials said .
The Taiwan -born scientist transferred most of the secret data in 1994 and 1995 , officials said .
American experts said the data would be useful to any nuclear power trying to replicate this country 's atomic designs .
But one American scientist said the codes and accompanying data were not , by themselves , sufficient to produce an exact copy of an American weapon .
American officials said there was evidence that the files were accessed by someone after they were placed in the unclassified network .
Other evidence suggests that this was done by a person who improperly used a password , the officials said .
The investigation is continuing , and officials do not know whether the data transferred by Lee was obtained by another country .
In 1996 , Lee became the focus of an FBI investigation into a separate case , what American official believe was China 's theft from Los Alamos of design data for America 's most advanced warhead , the W -88 .
That theft apparently took place in the 1980s .
China has denied stealing the material .
Now officials fear that a much broader array of nuclear test data may have been moved to Beijing in the 1990s .
Lee has not been charged with any crime .
Federal investigators did not discover the evidence of huge file transfers until last month , when they examined Lee 's office computer in connection with their investigation of the earlier theft at Los Alamos , a sprawling lab complex about 35 miles outside Santa Fe .
They then found evidence that Lee , who held one of the government 's highest security clearances , had been transferring enormous files involving millions of lines of secret computer code , officials said .
Although Lee had been under investigation in the W -88 case for nearly three years , Los Alamos officials failed to monitor his computer use and let him retain his access to nuclear secrets until late 1998 .
Lee was fired by the Energy Department for security violations on March 8 .
His attorney , Mark Holscher of Los Angeles , did not return a telephone call .
In the past , Holscher has denied any wrongdoing by his client .
President Clinton was first told of the new evidence by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on March 31 .
During a subsequent meeting at the White House residence in early April , the president told Richardson to `` get to the bottom of it , '' Richardson recalled in an interview Tuesday .
Earlier in March , before being briefed by Richardson , the president said he had not been told of any evidence of espionage during his administration .
In response to the new evidence and with the president 's support , Richardson shut down the classified computer systems at Los Alamos and two other major nuclear weapons laboratories this month .
He ordered changes in the computer security procedures to make it more difficult to move nuclear secrets out of the classified networks .
`` These Wen Ho Lee transgressions cannot occur any more , '' Richardson said in the interview .
Congressional leaders were told of the new evidence in classified briefings last week .
The huge scale of the security breach has shocked some officials , and has prompted a new sense of urgency in the FBI to solve the Los Alamos spy case .
The bureau is now pouring additional agents and resources into the investigation .
The evidence of transfers from his office computer provided the basis for an FBI search of Lee 's home on April 10 , officials said .
Lee is believed to be still living in Los Alamos .
Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence , said in an interview that the briefings on the new evidence `` confirmed my worst fears that China 's espionage is ongoing , it 's deep and we ca n't wish it away . ''
There were varying assessments of the gravity of the security breach .
One official familiar with the new evidence said , `` This is much , much , much worse than the W -88 case . ''
But an Energy Department official said that because it remained unclear whether China actually obtained the data , the case at this point `` is serious but not of the scope of the W -88 . ''
The fact that the huge data transfers were not detected until the last few weeks has sparked outrage among officials who wonder why computer use by a scientist already under suspicion as a spy was not being closely watched by Los Alamos or the FBI .
An internal investigation at the Energy Department into why Lee retained access to American nuclear secrets while he was a spy suspect was begun a month ago and is nearing completion .
It is likely to prompt disciplinary action against some lab and Energy Department officials , according to a senior Energy Department official .
FBI officials have told Congress that Lee and his wife , Sylvia , had prior relationships with the bureau .
In the early 1980s , Lee volunteered information to the bureau , but officials would not provide details .
Mrs. Lee provided the bureau with information on foreign visitors to Los Alamos from about 1987 to 1992 , but her information was not considered valuable .
Until now , Clinton and his aides have portrayed Chinese nuclear espionage as a problem that occurred during previous administrations .
Amid the furor over the administration 's handling of the earlier theft of the W -88 data from Los Alamos , the White House has stressed that the espionage occurred in the 1980s , long before Clinton took office .
But the new evidence raises the stakes of the congressional investigations now under way into how the Los Alamos case was handled after the W -88 theft was first detected in 1995 .
The information improperly transferred by Lee included what Los Alamos officials call the `` legacy '' codes .
According to John Browne , director of Los Alamos , the legacy codes consist of computer data used to design nuclear weapons , analyze nuclear test results and evaluate weapons materials and the safety characteristics of America 's nuclear warheads .
`` They are codes that integrate our best understanding of the processes that go on in a nuclear weapon , '' Browne said in an interview .
The legacy codes can be used to help design nuclear weapons through computer simulation , and so are valuable on their own .
But they become more valuable when combined with specific performance data , which would then enable someone to generate a computer simulation of American warhead designs .
Officials said Lee transferred both the legacy codes and the input data for specific U.S. warheads that go with the legacy codes .
The codes and performance data provide what a Los Alamos scientist described as a `` rough approximation '' of the physical processes that occur in a nuclear weapon .
Ray E. Kidder , a nuclear-weapons physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , said the combined data was equivalent to a scientific blueprint .
`` If you 've got the source code and the input data , you can reverse-engineer the thing and have a complete plan for nuclear explosive part of the weapon , '' Kidder said .
One lab official said investigators were still trying to determine the extent of the security breach and exactly how many warheads were involved in the data transfers .
The legacy codes and the warhead data that goes with them could be particularly valuable for a country , like China , that has signed onto the nuclear test ban treaty and relies solely on computer simulations to upgrade and maintain its nuclear arsenal .
The legacy codes are now used to maintain the American nuclear arsenal through computer simulation .
Most of Lee 's transfers occurred in 1994 and 1995 , just before China signed the test ban treaty in 1996 , according to American officials .
But officials say Lee may have started transferring files out of the classified computer network as early as 1983 .
So far , officials have not found evidence of transfers after 1995 .
Lee , 59 , began working at Los Alamos in 1978 .
His wife worked as a secretary at the lab .
Lee also traveled to China on several occasions while working at Los Alamos .
In June 1986 he delivered a paper on nuclear-weapons related science at a symposium in Beijing with the approval of Los Alamos officials .
In June 1988 he delivered another paper at a conference in Beijing , again with the lab 's approval .
In 1995 U.S. intelligence officials began to suspect that China had obtained design data from the W -88 warhead .
In 1996 the FBI began a criminal investigation of the W -88 theft , and Lee emerged as the principal suspect .
Yet by 1997 the bureau 's investigation was stalled .
The Department of Justice declined an FBI request to seek court approval to gain surreptitious access to Lee 's office computer , officials said .
Once the the request was rejected , officials of the bureau and the Energy Department determined that they needed Lee 's approval to examine his office computer .
In April 1997 Lee was transferred to a new job at Los Alamos , where he was responsible for updating legacy codes for five American warheads .
Although Los Alamos officials knew he was already under investigation in the W -88 theft , they believed that his continued access to the legacy codes would not be damaging because they knew he had had access to them for years , lab and Energy Department officials said .
But Los Alamos officials also assured the Energy Department that there were fire walls in place to prevent the leakage of classified information , they added .
It was not until last month , just a few days before he was fired , that the FBI finally asked for and received Lee 's authorization to search his computer , officials said .
Once the bureau saw the transferred files in the unclassified computer network , investigators realized their significance .
Within days , Richardson was briefed , and he then told the president and shut down the lab 's computer systems for two weeks .
But the FBI still encountered delays in winning Justice Department approval to seek a court-ordered search of Lee 's home , officials said , and did not conduct the search until April 10 .
The FBI has told Congress that it believes that the new information of computer transfers is the strongest evidence they have against Lee , officials said .
The New York Times delayed publication of this article for one day at the request of the FBI , which said the latest disclosure could impede its inquiry .
