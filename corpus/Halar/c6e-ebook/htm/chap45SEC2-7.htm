Although we know considerably more about the pineal than we did when Descartes described it as the seat of the soul, there is much more to learn. The pineal secretes the hormone <span class="Emphasis2">melatonin,</span> a modified amino acid. Depending on the species, the pineal contains light-sensitive cells or has nervous connections from the eyes, and melatonin regulates functions related to light and to seasons marked by changes in day length. For example, melatonin, like melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), affects skin pigmentation in many vertebrates. Most of the pineal’s functions, though, are related to biological rhythms associated with reproduction. Melatonin is secreted at night, and the amount secreted depends on the length of the night. In winter, for example, the days are short and the nights are long, so more melatonin is secreted. Thus, melatonin production is a link between a biological clock and daily or seasonal activities, such as reproduction. Recent evidence suggests that the main target cells of melatonin are in the part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as a biological clock. Melatonin seems to decrease the activity of neurons in the SCN, and this may be related to its role in mediating rhythms. However, much remains to be learned about the precise role of melatonin and about biological clocks in general.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
