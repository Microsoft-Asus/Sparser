MANAGUA , Nicaragua --
When Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman lumbered into a nationally televised charity event to donate his own money to victims of Hurricane Mitch last week , he pointedly handed the check to telethon organizers with his right hand .
`` I do n't do anything with the left , '' Aleman joked , referring to his hard-line stance against the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front , which took power 19 years ago through insurrection and was voted out of office in 1990 after years of civil war .
Mitch , which swept through Central America last weekend , killed up to 10,000 people , almost all of them in Honduras and Nicaragua .
The storm left nearly 1 million homeless and destroyed national economies .
Experts worry now about the economic toll on the region and the possibility of epidemics .
But the storm 's most important legacy could be political , some analysts say .
Mitch could reignite some of the region 's old feuds and hatreds , roiling its fragile political balance .
Nicaragua , El Salvador and Guatemala only recently ended the civil wars that tormented them in the 1970s and 1980s .
Those countries , which are now ruled by elected leaders , all reported Mitch -related deaths .
Officials in Nicaragua have placed the death toll there at 4,000 .
In Honduras , where an estimated 6,000 people died , a weak civilian government has only begun to break the hold of its powerful military .
`` This is going to put them back as far as their political development goes , '' said Vincent Gawronski , a political scientist at Florida International University in Miami who studies the political impact of hurricanes and other calamities in Latin America .
`` A disaster reveals the health of a political system , a society and an economy , '' he said .
`` It 's like taking the lid off a stinking garbage can . ''
In Nicaragua , much of the civil war fought between the Sandinistas and U.S. -backed rebels in the 1980s was centered in the areas worst hit by Mitch .
That war claimed more than 30,000 lives and gutted this impoverished nation 's economy .
Guerrilla bands of various political stripes still roam remote corners of the north .
Some observers fear serious violence could return , if political feuding gets in the way of relief efforts .
`` If hunger takes hold of the country , you could see social explosions , '' said analyst Oscar Rene Vargas , a frequent critic of Aleman 's .
In a nation where political grudges have spawned numerous civil wars over the centuries , and where democratic government was restored only eight years ago , the recriminations started even before the rains stopped .
Aleman and his Liberal Party won a hotly contested 1996 election over the Sandinistas , promising economic development and a rollback of the revolutionary government 's socialist policies .
But the Sandinistas remain the country 's second most powerful political force , their strength based in the very communities Mitch hit hardest .
Sandinista mayors complain that they are being cut out of the aid pipeline in the northwestern communities near the volcano where a Mitch -triggered mudslide killed at least 2,000 on Oct. 31 .
When Aleman traveled into the countryside last week to survey the storm 's damage , he was greeted by insult-slinging protesters , some of whom were undoubtedly sent by local Sandinista leaders .
`` The government 's manner of providing aid is taking inhuman proportions , '' charged Lludely Aburto , a member of the Sandinista delegation in the national congress .
`` This reflects the state of incompetence of the government . ''
Early last week , the Sandinista congressional delegation launched a short-lived effort to have Aleman removed from office because of alleged indifference and incompetence in the face of Mitch .
Aleman has not done much to dampen the feuding .
A wealthy lawyer who served as the pro-business mayor of Managua before being elected president , Aleman balked at accepting physicians , medicine and other aid from Fidel Castro 's Cuba , which was a prime backer of the Sandinista government .
And he angered many Sandinistas by naming members of Nicaragua 's conservative Roman Catholic clergy to oversee distribution of food and other aid .
`` He 's going to see to it that Sandinista communities do n't receive any aid , '' charged Ramona Castellon , a Sandinista leader in a flooded farm village near the city of Leon .
Government officials insist that the slow pace at which aid is reaching Mitch 's victims has to do with logistics , not political vendettas .
The relief operation `` does n't have political tints , '' said David Robleto , the government minister who coordinates international aid .
`` It has nothing to do with political parties . ''
In fact , much of the aid pouring into Nicaragua from around the world will be administered by municipal emergency committees headed by local clergy .
Members include military officers , politicians and civic leaders .
`` In the places we visited there is a certain working relationship , '' acknowleged Aburto , the Sandinista congresswoman , who toured hurricane-damaged communities on Thursday .
Sandinistas and some foreign aid agencies argue that Aleman should have declared a national emergency in the face of Mitch .
Such a declaration , they say , would have made Nicaragua 's crisis seem as urgent as that of neighboring Honduras , assuring this country an adequate share of the tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid being sent to the region .
But members of Aleman 's administration -- many of whom lived in exile during the Sandinistas ' rule and remain their intractable foes -- argue that such a declaration was unnecessary and would have been undemocratic .
It would have allowed authorities to tap phones , curtail travel and restrict business operations , Vice President Enrique Bolanos argued last week .
An emergency declaration also would have given additional authority to the army and police , organizations still heavily influenced by the Sandinistas .
`` We suffered all of that in the ' 80s , '' Bolanos said in a televised address , referring to the years of Sandinista government .
`` We do n't want it again . ''
Despite the political wrangling and maneuvering , leaders from all sides continue to call for national unity .
While national and local leaders bicker , some aid workers say , people in ravaged communities are putting their differences aside , at least for the moment .
`` At the local level , the people faced with the emergency are saying that -LRB- even if -RRB- they do n't agree on much , they can agree that they have a common problem , '' said the director of a foreign private aid agency in Managua .
