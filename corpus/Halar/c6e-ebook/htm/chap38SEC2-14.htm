Much of the animosity regarding GM organisms in agriculture is political, economic, or ethical in nature, and outside the scope of this book. But we <span class="Emphasis1">should</span> consider the biological concerns about GM crops. The most fundamental debate centers on the extent to which GM organisms are an unknown risk that could potentially cause harm to human health or to the environment. Those who want to proceed more slowly with agricultural biotechnology, or stop it entirely, are concerned about the unstoppable nature of the "experiment." If a drug trial produces unanticipated harmful results, the trial is stopped: We cannot stop the "trial" of novel organisms that have been introduced into the biosphere. Chapter 20 introduced the key concerns. Here, we take a closer look at a few of the controversies surrounding plant biotechnology in agriculture.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">One of the specific concerns is that genetic engineering could potentially transfer allergens, which are molecules to which some humans are allergic, from a gene source to a plant used for food. So far, there is no credible evidence that any GM plants specifically designed for human consumption have had any adverse effect on human health. Nevertheless, because of these health concerns, activists continue to lobby for the clear labeling of all foods made wholly or in part from products of GM organisms. Some activists also argue for strict regulations against the mixing of GM foods with non-GM foods during food transport, storage, and processing. Some biotechnology advocates, however, point out that similar demands were not raised when "transgenic" crops produced by traditional plant breeding techniques were put on the market. For example, triticale, a completely new crop, was artificially synthesized a few decades ago by combining the genomes of wheat and rye--two distinct genera that do not interbreed in nature. Triticale is now grown on over three million acres worldwide.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Many environmentalists are concerned that the growing of GM crops might have unforeseen effects on nontarget organisms. One recent study indicated that the larvae (caterpillars) of monarch butterflies responded adversely and even died following their consumption in the laboratory of milkweed leaves (their preferred food) heavily dusted with pollen from transgenic maize that produces the <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> toxin. This effect is not too surprising if one considers that <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> toxin was engineered into crop plants specifically because it is toxic to pests closely related to monarchs. Debate about this specific issue now centers on just how big an effect <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> maize pollen has on monarchs in nature, in contrast to the extreme exposure to the <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> toxin in the laboratory experiments. Maize pollen is produced for only a short time during the growing season, and most of it is not wind-dispersed too far from the field. A recent study provided evidence that only those milkweed plants bordering a maize field would potentially be dusted heavily enough with <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> pollen to adversely affect nontarget larvae. Moreover, in considering the negative effects of <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> pollen on monarch butterflies, one must also weigh the effects of the most likely alternative to the cultivation of <span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> maize--the spraying of non-<span class="Emphasis1">Bt</span> maize with chemical pesticides. Such spraying may be even more harmful to the nearby monarch population.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Perhaps the most serious concern that some scientists raise about GM crops is the possibility of the introduced genes escaping from a transgenic crop into related weeds through crop-to-weed hybridization. Perhaps, for example, spontaneous hybridization between a crop engineered for herbicide resistance and a wild relative might give rise to a "superweed" that would be much more difficult to control. Crop-to-weed transgene escape does occur. Its likelihood depends on the ability of the crop and weed to hybridize and on how the transgenes affect the overall fitness of the hybrids. In some cases, a desirable crop trait--a dwarf phenotype, for example--would be disadvantageous to a weed growing in the wild. In other instances, there are no weedy relatives nearby with which to hybridize; soybean, for example, has no wild relatives in the United States. However, many crops, such as cabbage and broccoli, are members of the mustard family and hybridize readily with wild mustard (generally considered to be a weed). In such cases, the planting of nontransgenic plant borders around fields of transgenic crops can help to "brush" the pollen off insect pollinators, thereby reducing crop-to-weed gene transfer. Efforts are also under way to breed male sterility into transgenic crops. These plants will still produce seeds and fruit if they are pollinated by nearby nontransgenic bisexual plants, but they will produce no viable pollen of their own. Another approach is to engineer the transgene into the chloroplast DNA of the crop; chloroplast DNA is inherited strictly from the maternal plant, so transgenes in the chloroplast cannot be transferred by pollen.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The continuing debate about GM organisms in agriculture exemplifies one of this textbook’s themes: the relationships of science and technology to society. Technological advances almost always involve some risk that unintended outcomes could occur. In the case of plant biotechnology, zero risk is unrealistic and probably unattainable. Scientists and the public need to assess the possible benefits of transgenic products versus the risks society is willing to take on a case-by-case basis. The best scenario would be for these discussions and decisions to be based on sound scientific information and testing rather than on reflexive fear or blind optimism.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
