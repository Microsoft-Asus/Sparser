Ukraine wants to form an international consortium to complete a pipeline and Black Sea oil terminal , and to modernize four refining plants , a top oil industry official said Tuesday .
Such a consortium is necessary if Ukraine is to take part in transporting Caspian Sea or Iranian oil to Europe , said Valery Shuliko , deputy head of the State Gas and Oil Industry Committee .
Shuliko said several international companies have expressed interest in joining such a consortium .
A plan might be approved by Cabinet later in the week , and details worked out by the end of the year , he said .
Shuliko said the government should keep 51 percent of shares in any consortium , the Interfax news agency reported .
Ukraine , along with Russia , Turkey , Georgia and Iran , is eager to transport Caspian Sea oil from huge Azerbaijani deposits to the West .
Azerbaijan late last month formally invited Ukraine , along with Russia , Turkey and Georgia , to join negotiations to establish the export route .
Ukraine has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers to the Black Sea port of Odessa , and from there via a pipeline to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export onward .
However , Azerbaijan has repeatedly indicated it favors a Turkish proposal .
According to Shuliko , Ukraine has completed 256 kilometers -LRB- 159 miles -RRB- of the 670-kilometer -LRB- 415-mile -RRB- pipeline to Brody , which would eventually be capable of carrying 30 million tons -LRB- 201 million barrels -RRB- of oil a year .
The Yuzhny oil terminal , with a planned capacity of about 40 million tons -LRB- 268 million barrels -RRB- a year , is about 15 percent ready , he said .
Shuliko said Ukraine would need dlrs 600 million to dlrs 800 million to complete the Odessa - Brody pipeline and the Yuzhny oil terminal .
About dlrs 400 million of that is needed to modernize four refineries in southern Ukraine .
Meanwhile , Ukraine 's own oil output was slightly down so far this year , Shuliko 's committee reported .
It said oil and gas condensate production totaled 1.64 million tons -LRB- 11 million barrels -RRB- in January - May 1998 , 4.8 percent lower than the same period in 1997 .
Natural gas production was up 0.8 percent over the same period , the report said .
