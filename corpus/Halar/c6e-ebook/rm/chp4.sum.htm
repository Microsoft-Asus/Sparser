Hydrocarbons consist only of carbon and hydrogen. Carbon’s versatile bonding is the basis for isomers, molecules with the same molecular formula but different structures and thus different properties. Three types of isomers are structural isomers, geometric isomers, and enantiomers.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity4A:<span class="Emphasis1">

The hydroxyl group (--OH), found in alcohols, has a polar covalent bond, which helps alcohols dissolve in water. The carbonyl group (

		) can be either at the end of a carbon skeleton (aldehyde) or within the skeleton (ketone). The carboxyl group (--COOH) is found in carboxylic acids. The hydrogen of this group can dissociate, making the molecule a weak acid. The amino group (--NH<SUB>2</SUB>) can accept a proton (H<SUP>+</SUP>), thereby acting as a base. The sulfhydryl group (--SH) helps stabilize the structure of some proteins. The phosphate group (
