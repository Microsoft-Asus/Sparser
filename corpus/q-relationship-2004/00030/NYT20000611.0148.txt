ALBANY , N.Y. --
Joseph L. Bruno , the Republican majority leader , struggled to explain why the State Senate was about to pass a hate-crimes bill , which he and his colleagues had blocked since the 1980s .
Bruno dismissed the bill as symbolism , a measure that would do nothing to fight crime , though he acknowledged its popularity .
`` You know , we 're in a business where times change , '' he said .
`` We 're contemplating doing something with gun safety , and you know , three months ago , or a year ago , or three years ago , that 's not anything we would contemplate .
Times change , and I think we have to stay flexible . ''
No faction in New York politics has changed more of late than the State Senate .
The Senate Republicans , a bulwark of the state machinery that has had a vise grip for decades , look on this year 's election with greater fear than they have felt since the 1970s .
They see a presidential election in which most polls show Al Gore swamping George W. Bush in New York .
They see an entire state , and some battleground districts , that have become more heavily Democratic .
They see a voter rebellion against the Republican Party in Nassau County .
And they see the Senate Democrats , long a punching bag who often failed to muster opponents to Republican incumbents in swing districts , fielding the strongest team of challengers in memory .
In the last several months , the Senate Republicans , long a redoubt of conservatism in a liberal state , have made a march leftward , approving legislation that it would have been hard to imagine them accepting a few years ago .
Each measure appealed to moderate and liberal voters in New York City and its suburbs , where the most vulnerable Republican senators are , or placated crucial interest groups like labor unions or the elderly .
On Wednesday , for the first time , the Senate passed a bill providing increased penalties for crimes motivated by hatred of any of several groups , with 24 of 36 Republicans voting in favor .
Among the protected classes of victims listed in the bill are gays and lesbians , a step that Bruno and many of his colleagues had said they would not take .
Since last fall , the Senate has passed a bill making it a crime to block access to abortion clinics , a bill creating a major new health-care entitlement program for the working poor , a 55-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax , a bill requiring that all cigarettes meet fire safety standards , and a bill restricting companies ' ability to sell air pollution `` credits '' that , in effect , give polluters the right to violate clean air standards .
In recent budget talks , it was the Senate Republicans who championed state-subsidized prescription drugs for the elderly and an important tax credit for the poor .
And with just a few days left in this year 's legislative session , Senate leaders are seriously considering passing a broad package of gun controls , approving an increase in the state minimum wage from $ 5.15 to $ 6.75 , and giving retired government workers automatic annual pension increases for the first time .
`` It 's the new left-wing Senate , '' said Sen. Martin Connor of Brooklyn , the Democratic minority leader .
`` The mood across the aisle seems pretty grim .
They 're really worried about their survival , and the legislative result is they 're rushing to adopt the Democratic agenda . ''
Republican senators have privately teased each other about their new liberal credentials .
`` I see them acting very nervously , and I see them making a lot of mistakes because of it , '' said Michael L. Long , chairman of the state 's Conservative Party .
`` In their fear and their desire to stay in control , they 're acting like there 's no difference between Republicans and Democrats , and passing a lot of far-left legislation . ''
The stakes in control of the Senate are enormous .
With Democrats firmly in control of the assembly , a Democratic majority in the Senate could form a unified legislative front in taking on Gov. George E. Pataki , a Republican , over budgets and other issues .
They could begin sending the governor bills , like an overhaul of the campaign finance laws , that have been bottled up in the Senate .
The Senate majority controls several hundred patronage jobs , and many of those people become campaign foot soldiers when it is time to circulate petitions , arrange rallies and get out the vote .
Those jobs also provide a breeding ground for candidates for local and legislative offices .
This year 's elections are particularly crucial because the next Senate will draw the district lines for the next decade .
In a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 million to 3.1 million , the Republicans have maintained control of the Senate largely through the power to carve out as many favorable districts as possible themselves .
Political analysts say nonpartisan or pro- Democrat redistricting would give Democrats solid control of the chamber for the foreseeable future .
Republicans hold a 36-to-25 edge in the Senate , and even the Democrats acknowledge they have no better than an outside shot of picking up the six seats needed to take control .
A shift in power is rare ; the Assembly last changed hands in the Democrats ' post- Watergate sweep of 1974 , and the Senate has had a Republican majority for all but one year since 1938 .
But even knocking off three Republican senators could make it hard for Bruno to control legislation on which there are a few dissenters in his party .
It could also persuade political contributors who now heavily favor Republicans to start hedging their bets and give to Democrats , too .
The great wild card in this year 's races is Nassau County , where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a wide margin .
Will voter anger last until November , and will it spill over from local contests to state races ?
At this point , no one can do more than guess .
In a way , Pataki , a fellow Republican , has helped put the Senate Republicans on the spot , siding with legislation opposed by conservatives , rather than giving them a powerful ally in a united front .
He was a major architect of the health-care program and the cigarette tax , and he has called for gun control and hate-crimes legislation .
Republicans are also worried about the loss of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as their party 's candidate for the United States Senate .
Giuliani had been expected to fare well in the city and its suburbs , which could have helped Republicans down the ticket , and it remains to be seen how Rep. Rick A. Lazio will do as his replacement .
