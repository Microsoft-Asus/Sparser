India will build its first nuclear-powered submarine by 2004 and eventually fit it with missiles carrying nuclear warheads , Jane 's Intelligence Review reports in its latest issue .
Experts have said that following last month 's nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan , the South Asian arms race would shift to developing means to launch the weapons .
Two Jane 's reports in the magazine 's June issue focused on a key element of India 's planned delivery system .
The reports were by Bombay -based science writer Gopi Rethinaraj and Andrew Koch , a senior research analyst at the Center for Defense Information in Washington .
India has said it needs a nuclear defense to counter the nuclear capability of neighbors China and Pakistan , with whom it has fought a total of four wars in the last 50 yeas .
India accuses China of supporting Pakistan 's nuclear program .
Rethinaraj , discussing his research Friday in an interview , said he expected India , with Russian help , to put in place the hull and reactor of the submarine by the end of this year and finish assembling the components by 2004 .
A fleet of five Indian submarines is planned .
Jane 's said India would be the only country other than the five official nuclear weapon states -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- to operate nuclear submarines .
Since conventional submarines need to surface at least once a week to draw oxygen to run diesel generators , they can be easily detected .
Nuclear submarines , however , can stay submerged for more than three months .
Rethinaraj said India would eventually arm its subs with nuclear missiles .
Analysts estimated that production would begin in 2005 of Sagarika missiles , which are being developed for underwater launching .
India 's nuclear submarines will be propelled by a pressurized water reactor that will burn enriched uranium fuel .
A land -based prototype of the submarine 's engine has been tested at Kalpakkam in southern India , according to Rethinaraj and Koch .
Russian assistance to the Indian project is mainly in non-nuclear areas such as hull design and underwater navigation .
Russia also is reportedly helping India develop the Sagarika missiles and supplying a limited amount of turbojet and guidance technology .
Under a contract signed five days ago , India awarded Russia a dlrs 2.6 billion contract to build two nuclear power reactors in southern India .
The contract was in exchange for Russia 's help on the submarine project , Jane 's said .
Despite U.S. opposition to the deal , Russia assured India it would brook no outside interference in their economic relationship .
