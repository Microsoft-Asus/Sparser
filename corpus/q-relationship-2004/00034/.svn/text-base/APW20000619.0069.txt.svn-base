WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Clinton administration moved on Monday to lift a half-century of trade restrictions on North Korea , putting new regulations into place that will allow the United States to resume a variety of economic contacts .
The action was heavy in symbolism , coming one week after an historic summit between North and South Korea .
But economists predicted that trade flows would remain tiny for a number of years given that North Korea is emerging from decades of extreme isolation .
`` There will be some interest on the part of American companies , but it wo n't happen overnight .
North Korea is one of the world 's poorest economies and it has been closed off to the world for a long time , '' said Franklin Vargo , head of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers .
The new rules , published in the Federal Register on Monday , relax a once near-total trade embargo imposed on North Korea during the early days of the Korean War in 1950 .
The revised rules will allow North Korea to export raw materials and finished goods to the United States and will allow U.S. firms to sell American goods -- without military uses -- and farm products to North Korea .
The regulations also will open up air travel and shipping routes between the two countries as well as banking transfers between individuals and companies .
It also eases restrictions on investment by American companies .
President Clinton had announced plans to ease the trade embargo nine months ago , as a reward for North Korea 's agreement to halt missile testing .
But formal implementation did not take place until Monday -- just days after the groundbreaking summit in Pyongyang between South Korean President Kim Dae -jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said easing the trade embargo reflected the administration 's view that North Korea will continue to observe the moratorium on testing long-range missiles .
Boucher said that members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in South Korea hoped to travel soon to North Korea on a fact-finding mission , but he said , `` I think we have to be realistic and understand that the actual opportunities for trade may be limited by the state of North Korea 's economy . ''
Communist North Korea , one of the most impoverished and isolated nations in the world , has faced widespread famine and disease in recent years that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of North Koreans .
It has an economy that has shrunk steadily throughout the 1990s after its support from the Soviet Union and other former communist bloc countries in Eastern Europe was cut back .
The country has significant reserves of various minerals from iron ore to copper and zinc and some analysts forecast that the first U.S. companies to invest in North Korea might come from the mineral sector .
Gary Hufbauer , trade analyst at the Institute for International Economics , a Washington think tank , said the most likely first impact of the U.S. decision will be to encourage South Korean manufacturing companies to establish operations there to take advantage of lower wages .
Low -end consumer goods such as shoes could be shipped directly to the United States while component parts such as car bumpers and other component parts could be shipped to South Korea for assembly into products for export .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` North Korea will need help from South Koreans to learn how to export .
They have been so insular , '' Hufbauer said .</ENAMEX>
But he noted that China was in a similar situation when it decided to open up to the rest of the world in the late 1970s , triggering two decades of rapid economic growth .
`` It is conceivable that North Korea could have a period of very rapid growth if they allow things to go forward , but they will have to make the investment atmosphere more friendly , '' he said .
North Korea exported just $ 743 million in products , according to the most recent published estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency , compared to $ 133 billion in exports for its rich neighbor South Korea in 1998 .
South Korea has enjoyed an export boom over the past 20 years that was slowed only temporarily by the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 .
