LONDON , August 18 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- British scientists have found that the `` mad cow '' disease and its human equivalent may spread through open wounds , said a report published today .
The finding , at the Institute of Animal Health in Scotland , indicates that the fatal brain disease could be easily contracted when infected materials come into contact with open wounds .
Scientists participating in the study were quoted by a report in the newspaper Observer as saying that health care workers should take extra cautions to handle infected materials .
Those who may come into contact with materials infected by the `` mad cow '' disease and its human equivalent must take steps to protect their skin from cuts and scratches , they said .
Under laboratory environment , the scientists successfully transmitted scrapie , the sheep version of the `` mad cow '' disease , to mice through cuts and scratches in their skin .
Skin scarification , they noted , has proved to be a more effective way of transmitting the disease than either direct inoculation or feeding contaminated material to the mice .
The discovery will have significant public health implications for those who believe that the disease is capable of passing into humans through the food chain , according to the Observer report .
