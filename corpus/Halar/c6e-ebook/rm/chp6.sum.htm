Spontaneous changes involve a decrease in free energy (- <span class="symbol">D</span><span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). In an exergonic (spontaneous) chemical reaction, the products have less free energy than the reactants (- <span class="symbol">D</span><span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). Endergonic (nonspontaneous) reactions require an input of energy (+ <span class="symbol">D</span><span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). In cellular metabolism, exergonic reactions power endergonic reactions (energy coupling).

Release of its terminal phosphate group produces ADP, inorganic phosphate, and free energy. ATP drives endergonic reactions by transfer of the phosphate to specific reactants, making them more reactive. In this way, cells can carry out work, such as movement and anabolism. Catabolic pathways drive the regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphate.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity6B:<span class="Emphasis1">
