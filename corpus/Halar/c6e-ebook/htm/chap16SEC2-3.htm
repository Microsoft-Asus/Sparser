We imagine that prior to duplication the hydrogen bonds are broken, and the two chains unwind and separate. Each chain then acts as a template for the formation onto itself of a new companion chain, so that eventually we shall have two pairs of chains, where we only had one before. Moreover, the sequence of the pairs of bases will have been duplicated exactly.<A href="javascript:popNote('16','2')"><SUP><B>*</B></SUP></A></p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.7</span> illustrates Watson and Crick’s basic idea. To make it easier to follow, the diagram shows only a short section of double helix, in untwisted form. Notice that if you cover one of the two DNA strands of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.7a</span>, you can still determine its linear sequence of bases by referring to the unmasked strand and applying the base-pairing rules. The two strands are complementary; each stores the information necessary to reconstruct the other. When a cell copies a DNA molecule, each strand serves as a template (mold) for ordering nucleotides into a new complementary strand. One at a time, nucleotides line up along the template strand according to the base-pairing rules. The nucleotides are linked to form the new strands. Where there was one double-stranded DNA molecule at the beginning of the process, there are now two, each an exact replica of the "parent" molecule. The copying mechanism is analogous to using a photographic negative to make a positive image, which can in turn be used to make another negative, and so on.

The requisite experiments were simple in concept but difficult to perform. Watson and Crick’s model predicts that when a double helix replicates, each of the two daughter molecules will have one old strand, derived from the parent molecule, and one newly made strand. This <span class="Emphasis2">semiconservative model</span> can be distinguished from a conservative model of replication, in which the parent molecule somehow emerges from the replication process intact (that is, it is conserved). In yet a third model, called the dispersive model, all four strands of DNA following replication have a mixture of old and new DNA (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.8</span>, p. 294). Although mechanisms for conservative or dispersive DNA replication are not easy to devise, these models remained possibilities until they could be ruled out. Finally, in the late 1950s, Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl devised experiments that tested the three hypotheses. Their experiments supported the semiconservative model, as predicted by Watson and Crick (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 16.9</span>, p. 294).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig16-8','../fig/big/fig16-8.jpg','fig16-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig16-8.jpg" alt="fig16-8" name="myfig16-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 16-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Three alternative models of DNA replication.</span> The short segments of double helix here symbolize the DNA within a cell.
