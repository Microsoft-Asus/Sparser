FREETOWN , Sierra Leone
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Guerrillas have released 180 more U.N. hostages in Sierra Leone , leaving fewer than 100 captives in rebel hands , and President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has announced plans to prosecute the rebel leader .
The U.N. peacekeepers were handed over to authorities in Foya , a border town in neighboring Liberia , according to a statement released in the Liberian capital , Monrovia .
Liberia said fewer than 100 of the original 500 hostages are still in rebel hands .
Meanwhile , Kabbah accused Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh of committing serious crimes .
`` This time around Sankoh will be prosecuted , '' Kabbah said in comments carried on state radio and television -- the government 's first comment on his fate since the rebel leader 's capture earlier this month .
Sankoh was convicted of treason in 1998 and sentenced to death but was later released from jail under the provisions of a peace accord signed last July that was meant to end to civil war .
Kabbah did not say what charges the rebel chief would face or when a trial would be held .
The government has said that any prosecution would be for crimes that were committed after last year 's signing of the peace deal .
The government has been investigating Sankoh 's role in the deaths of 21 people at the hands of rebel gunmen during a protest in front of his Freetown residence earlier this month , as well as allegations that rebels have been involved in diamond smuggling .
U.N. and human rights officials also charge that rebels have continued to carry out killings and rapes in parts of Sierra Leone that remain under their control .
Sankoh 's rebels have reportedly demanded his freedom , and any prosecution threatens to ignite further conflict .
The developments came as the United Nations revealed that it believes several mutilated corpses found this week in the war-ravaged west African nation were the bodies of U.N. peacekeepers .
The bodies are believed to be four Zambians and one or two Nigerians , U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said .
They were badly decomposed when found Monday , and in some cases only whitened bones remained .
The United Nations has been collecting information from the various forces who had fighters in the area near Rogberi Junction , about 50 miles east of the capital , Freetown , where there was a May 6 battle between U.N. peacekeepers and RUF rebels .
Four Zambian and two Nigerian soldiers were reported missing after the battle , U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York .
The bodies were discovered not far from where Associated Press Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora and Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork were killed Wednesday in a rebel ambush .
South African cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek photographer Yannis Behrakis suffered light injuries in the same attack .
In his broadcast comment , Kabbah expressed his sorrow to the families of the two slain journalists and to those of the two wounded .
`` These men were not involved in any fighting but were trying to bring out the facts for the whole world to know , '' Kabbah said .
The rebels killed tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneons and intentionally mutilated many more during the civil war .
The conflict reignited earlier this month when the RUF took the U.N. peacekeepers hostage and began advancing toward Freetown .
Since then , an alliance of pro-government forces has been pushing the rebels away from the capital .
Human Rights Watch accused the RUF of imposing a `` reign of terror '' during its weeklong occupation of the area around Masiaka , 45 miles east of Freetown .
Rebel fighters abducted , raped , killed and mutilated civilians in the area before they were repelled more than a week ago by pro-government forces , the international group said Friday .
The rebels have also been looting and destroying homes , and forcibly recruiting civilians , U.N. human rights official Richard Bennett said .
There were also reports of beatings and slayings by pro-government forces .
Both sides have been re-enlisting child fighters , some as young as 10 , Bennett said .
Thousands of civilians have fled their homes .
More than 35,000 people have poured into Freetown alone since the beginning of May .
Up to 10,000 other people have gathered on an island just north Freetown after fleeing violence , Eckhard said .
