ABUJA , Nigeria
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Bidding to bring democracy to an international pariah , U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan held talks Tuesday with Nigeria 's new military ruler and was due to meet the country 's most prominent prisoner .
Annan spoke privately with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi for slightly more than an hour at the military leader 's state residence in the capital , Abuja .
The U.N. secretary-general was expected to see Moshood Abiola , the presumed winner of 1993 elections who has been imprisoned since 1995 , said human rights and government officials on condition of anonymity .
It was unclear exactly when the meeting would occur .
Amid the talks , the government announced the dismissal of four key officials viewed as hardline militants .
Those fired included the country 's top intelligence official , national security advisor Ismalia Gwarzo , a former policeman .
He was replaced by retired Maj. Gen. Abdullah Mohamed .
The others dismissed were special advisors Laz Unaogu , Alhaji Wada Nas and Wole Oylese .
No reason was given for the dismissals although some observers interpreted the move as a sign the military regime was shedding itself of hardliners opposed to democratic reforms .
Abubakar has raised expectations for democratic reform by releasing more than 40 political prisoners and suggesting that Abiola too may eventually be freed .
Annan declined to speak to reporters , although a member of his delegation , Ahmad Fawzi , said he had `` frank discussions '' with Abubakar .
The meeting was regarded by both Abubakar and Abdulsalam as the first in a series that will continue after the U.N. team has left Nigeria , Fawzi added .
Commonwealth Secretary - General Emeka Anyaoku also met Abubakar later Tuesday and would be given the chance to speak to Abiola later , human rights activists and government officials said .
Annan , who is from Ghana , and the Nigerian -born Anyaoku are the highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the late ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa in November 1995 .
Abacha died of heart failure on June 8 and was quickly succeeded by Abubakar , a career soldier with little political experience .
The Commonwealth , a 54-nation grouping of Britain and its former colonies , suspended Nigeria from its ranks following the execution .
Annan was sitting down with a wide range of pro-democracy and opposition activists during his visit , which he said was meant to ease Nigeria 's transition to democracy and civilian rule while improving strained international ties with the country .
Former Nigerian Vice President Alex Ekueme , who was strongly opposed to Abacha 's rule , was among the first to meet the U.N. chief .
`` The secretary-general 's main preoccupation is the acceleration of a credible political transition program , '' Fawzi said .
On Wednesday , Annan was to attend a `` mini heads-of-state summit '' organized by the Nigerian government , Fawzi said .
A government spokesman said Ghana 's President Jerry Rawlings was expected and others been invited .
It was not clear what was on the agenda .
