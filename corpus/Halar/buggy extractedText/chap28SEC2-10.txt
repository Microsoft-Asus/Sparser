 Euglenozoa: The euglenozoa includes both photosynthetic and heterotrophic flagellates

Several protistan groups are equipped with flagella that function in locomotion. Two of these groups of flagellates, the euglenoids and the kinetoplastids, make up the clade labeled Euglenozoa in FIGURE 28.8.

The euglenoids (Euglenophyta, such as Euglena and its close relatives) are characterized by an anterior pocket, or chamber, from which one or two flagella emerge. Paramylon, a glucose polymer that functions as a storage molecule, is also characteristic of euglenoids. Euglena, the organism in FIGURE 28.3, is chiefly autotrophic. However, many euglenoids are mixotrophic or heterotrophic, absorbing organic molecules from their surroundings or engulfing prey by phagocytosis.

The kinetoplastids (Kinetoplastida) have a single large mitochondrion associated with a unique organelle, the kinetoplast, that houses extranuclear DNA. The kinetoplastids are symbiotic, and some are pathogenic to their hosts. For example, species of Trypanosoma cause African sleeping sickness, a human disease that is spread by the bite of the tsetse fly (FIGURE 28.11). Sleeping sickness is a debilitating disease common in parts of Africa. Trypanosomes escape being killed by the host's defenses by being quick-change artists. They alter the molecular structure of their coats frequently, thus preventing immunity from developing in the host.
