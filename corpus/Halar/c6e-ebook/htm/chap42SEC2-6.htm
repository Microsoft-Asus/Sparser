This velocity change follows from the <span class="Emphasis1">law of continuity</span>, which describes fluid movement through pipes. If a pipe’s diameter changes over its length, a fluid will flow through narrower segments of the pipe faster than it flows through wider segments. The <span class="Emphasis1">volume</span> of flow per second must be constant through the entire pipe, so the fluid must flow faster as the cross-sectional area of the pipe narrows. For instance, compare the velocity of water squirted by a hose with and without a nozzle.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Based on the law of continuity, it may seem that blood should travel faster through capillaries than through arteries, because the diameter of capillaries is very small. However, it is the <span class="Emphasis1">total</span> cross-sectional area of capillaries that determines flow rate. Each artery conveys blood to such an enormous number of capillaries that the total cross-sectional area is much greater in capillary beds than in any other part of the circulatory system. For this reason, the blood slows substantially as it enters the arterioles from arteries, and slows further in the capillary beds. Capillaries are the only vessels with walls thin enough to permit the transfer of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid, and the slower flow of blood through these tiny vessels enhances this exchange. As blood leaves the capillary beds and passes to the venules and veins, it speeds up again as a result of the reduction in total cross-sectional area (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.10</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-10','../fig/big/fig42-10.jpg','fig42-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-10.jpg" alt="fig42-10" name="myfig42-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The interrelationship of blood flow velocity, cross-sectional area of blood vessels, and blood pressure.</span> Blood flow velocity decreases markedly in the arterioles and is slowest in the capillaries, owing to an increase in total cross-sectional area. Blood pressure, the main force driving blood from the heart to the capillaries, is highest in the arteries. Peaks in blood pressure corresponding to ventricular systole alternate with lower blood pressures corresponding to diastole (elasticity in arterial walls keeps diastolic pressure from falling to zero). Resistance to flow through the arterioles and capillaries, due to contact of the blood with a greater surface area of endothelium, reduces blood pressure and eliminates pressure peaks.</span></td></tr></table><p class="Header3">Blood Pressure</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Fluids exert a force called hydrostatic pressure against surfaces they contact, and it is that pressure that drives fluids through pipes. Fluids always flow from areas of high pressure to areas of lower pressure. The hydrostatic force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel and that propels blood is blood pressure. Blood pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins and is highest in arteries when the heart contracts during ventricular systole (<span class="Emphasis2">systolic pressure;</span> see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.10</span>).</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">When you take your pulse by placing your fingers on your wrist, you can feel an artery bulge with each heartbeat. The surge of pressure is partly due to the narrow openings of arterioles impeding the exit of blood from the arteries. Thus, when the heart contracts, blood enters the arteries faster than it can leave, and the vessels stretch from the pressure. The elastic walls of the arteries snap back during diastole, but the heart contracts again before enough blood has flowed into the arterioles to completely relieve pressure in the arteries. This impedance by the arterioles is called <span class="Emphasis2">peripheral resistance.</span> As a consequence of the elastic arteries working against peripheral resistance, there is a substantial blood pressure even during diastole (<span class="Emphasis2">diastolic pressure</span>), and blood flows into arterioles and capillaries continuously (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.10</span>). As shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.11</span> on page 880, the arterial blood pressure of a healthy resting human oscillates between about 120 mm Hg at systole and 70 mm Hg at diastole.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-11','../fig/big/fig42-11.jpg','fig42-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-11.jpg" alt="fig42-11" name="myfig42-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Measurement of blood pressure.</span> Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers separated by a slash; the first number is the systolic pressure; the second is the diastolic pressure.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Blood pressure is determined partly by cardiac output and partly by peripheral resistance. Contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of the arterioles constricts the tiny vessels, increases peripheral resistance, and therefore increases blood pressure upstream in the arteries. When the smooth muscles relax, the arterioles dilate, blood flow through the arterioles increases, and pressure in the arteries falls. Nerve impulses, hormones, and other signals control these arteriole wall muscles. Stress, both physical and emotional, can raise blood pressure by triggering nervous and hormonal responses that will constrict blood vessels.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Cardiac output is adjusted in concert with changes in peripheral resistance. This coordination of regulatory mechanisms maintains adequate blood flow as the demands on the circulatory system change. For example, during heavy exercise the arterioles in working muscles dilate. This response admits a greater flow of oxygen-rich blood to the muscles and also decreases peripheral resistance. By itself, this would cause a fall in blood pressure (and therefore blood flow) in the body as a whole. However, cardiac output increases, maintaining blood pressure and supporting the necessary increase in blood flow.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">In large land animals, another factor that affects blood pressure is gravity. Besides the force needed to overcome peripheral resistance, additional pressure is necessary if blood must be pushed above the level of the heart. In a standing human, blood must rise about 0.35 m to get from the heart to the brain. This demands an extra 27 mm Hg of pressure, which requires the heart to expend more energy in its contraction cycle. The pumping challenge is much greater for animals with long necks. Standing giraffes need to pump blood as much as 2.5 m above the heart. That requires about 190 mm Hg of additional blood pressure in the left ventricle, and a giraffe’s normal systolic pressure near the heart is over 250 mm Hg. (Systolic pressure that high would be extremely dangerous in a human.) Special check valves and sinuses, along with feedback mechanisms that reduce cardiac output, prevent this high pressure from damaging the giraffe’s brain when it puts its head down to drink--a body position that causes blood to flow downhill almost 2 m from the heart, adding an extra 150 mm Hg of blood pressure in the arteries leading to the brain. Some physiologists speculate about blood pressure and cardiovascular adaptations in dinosaurs--some of which had necks almost 10 m long, requiring a systolic pressure of 760 mm Hg just to pump blood to the brain when the head was fully raised.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">By the time blood reaches the veins, its pressure is not affected much by the action of the heart. This is because the blood encounters so much resistance as it passes through the millions of tiny arterioles and capillaries that the pressure generated by the pumping heart has been dissipated and can no longer propel the blood in the veins. How does blood return to the heart, especially when it must travel from the lower extremities against gravity? Rhythmic contractions of smooth muscles in the walls of venules and veins account for some movement of the blood. More importantly, the activity of skeletal muscles during exercise squeezes blood through the veins (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.9</span>). Also, when we inhale, the change in pressure within the thoracic (chest) cavity causes the venae cavae and other large veins near the heart to expand and fill with blood.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
