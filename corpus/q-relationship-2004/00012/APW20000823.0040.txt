WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Wiring damage of the type that could have caused the TWA Flight 800 disaster has been found in other aging aircraft , federal investigators said Wednesday .
A four-year investigation of the crash of the Boeing 747 New York -to- Paris flight led to a conclusion that it was caused by an explosion of vapors in a fuel tank of the 25-year -old plane </ENAMEX>.
Although a solid body of circumstantial evidence points to an electrical short as the cause of the explosion , insufficient wire was recovered to know for sure , said Robert Swaim of the National Transportation Safety Board .
But the investigation led to discovery of damaged wiring in other older planes , Swaim told a hearing .
`` We looked at other planes from other carriers and other countries , '' Swaim said .
Inspectors found worn insulation , improper wiring repairs , opened splices that should have been sealed and lint on circuit breakers .
In some cases , he added , wiring had been damaged by chemicals such as anti-corrision spray and overflow from lavatories .
Wiring checks in 25 airlines -- some old , some new -- found that `` all had some kind of foreign material except for one new 737 , '' Swaim said .
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said the longer a plane files , the more changes and modifications it needs .
He said he is not sure the industry is paying enough attention to that issue .
But Bernard Loeb , aviation safety director for NTSB , cautioned that investigators are `` not saying the problem has reached the level of planes being unsafe .
`` We found problems and they need to be addressed , '' he said .
As a result of the TWA crash , Swaim said , the Federal Aviation Administration has formed a task force to develop improved maintenance procedures for aging aircraft .
Swaim 's conclusion that a fuel-tank explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800 , killing all 230 people abroad off Long Island , N.Y. , was announced at the first day of the hearing Tuesday .
He spent four years looking for the source of ignition of the explosion .
`` I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of wire and say , `` Here it is , ' '' he said .
A number of possible causes of the explosion were considered , including problems with the main landing gear , static electricity , a small explosive charge , a missile and a meteorite strike , he said .
Investigators zeroed in on the short circuit because of a combination of factors which , taken together , were telling .
A crew member was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder remarking on the fuel flow indicator swaying crazily shortly before the crash .
A buzz on the cockpit voice recorder went silent in the moments before the crash .
Additionally , there had been recent problems with lights on the plane .
While wiring inside the fuel tank is very low voltage those wires are bundled together with higher voltage wires and a short could have been carried into the fuel tank , investigators said .
Air and fuel had been heated by an air conditioner positioned underneath the tank while the plane was delayed for three hours prior to takeoff .
That helped to make the tank volatile when it climbed in altitude , NTSB investigator Joseph Kolly said .
Given those conditions , a spark as weak as the static electricity transferred between a person 's hand a metal doorknob would have been sufficient for an explosion , Kolly said .
TWA Flight 800 went down shortly after leaving New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport on July 17 , 1996 , bound for Paris .
The crash has spawned a host of conspiracy theories , the most prevalent being that a bomb or a missile brought down the plane .
Some still contend the government is trying to cover up the real cause , and one group , calling itself the TWA 800 Eyewitness Alliance , ran a full-page ad in Tuesday 's Washington Times insisting missiles were to blame .
Hall on Tuesday chastised those who continue to push those theories .
The FBI , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and his investigators all failed to find evidence of a bomb or missile blast , he said .
Loeb said that bomb and missile blasts leave distinct patterns .
`` High -energy explosions leave distinctive damage signatures such as severe pitting , cratering , hot gas washing , and petaling .
No such damage was found on any portion of the recovered airplane structure , '' Loeb said .
The physical evidence `` leads to the inescapable conclusion that the cause of the in-flight breakup of TWA Flight 800 was a fuel-air explosion inside the center wing tank , '' Loeb said .
John Seaman of Albany , N. Y. , who lost his 19-year -old niece Michelle Becker of St. Petersburg , Fla. , was at the hearing in Washington , along with more than 75 relatives of victims .
`` This speculation still that this was a missile is making all of us crazy , '' Seaman said .
`` It makes us feel like there is someone walking around today laughing about the death of our loved ones .
If all they can come up with is a probable cause then that is all that can be done . ''
