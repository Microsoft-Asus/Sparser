CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak left for neighboring Libya Thursday to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi who is recovering from a hip operation , officials said .
Mubarak is traveling in an aircraft with several ministers and senior aides , said the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity .
It was not clear if Mubarak will fly all the way to the north African country -- in defiance of a U.N. air embargo -- or land at an Egyptian military air base near the Libyan border and travel by road from there .
The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie , Scotland that killed 270 people .
Gadhafi , 56 , broke a hip bone while exercising on Tuesday and he underwent surgery to repair the hip the same day .
He is in good condition and has resumed normal work , the Libyan official news agency JANA said Wednesday .
Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always driven across the Egyptian - Libyan border .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Last month , the Organization of African Unity urged member states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and religious implications or those relating to official OAU work</ENAMEX> .
But apart from Libya only Chad and Niger have heeded the call so far and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last month , apparently angered by Egypt 's refusal to let him fly to Cairo .
