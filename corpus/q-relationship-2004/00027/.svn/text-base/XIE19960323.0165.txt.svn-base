BRASILIA , March 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Agriculture Minister Jose Eduardo de Andrade Vieira said today that Brazilian beef producers could benefit from the `` mad cow disease '' in the United Kingdom , which has prompted several countries to stop importing beef from the island country .
Brazilian beef exports toward the European market could increase after five European countries banned the import of British beef , said the minister .
The `` mad cow disease , '' known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- , affects a lot of cattle in the United Kingdom , and scientists are afraid it can be caught by the human being .

The predominant beef race in Brazil is the Nelore , which is different from those affected in the United Kingdom , said the minister .
Europe is haunted by a major health scare and beef cattle prices slumped 15 percent in Britain , whose beef industry is worth about 3 billion U.S. dollars a year and sees about one third of its sales go overseas .
