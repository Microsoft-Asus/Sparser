For the past century, there was broad consensus among systematists for at least the major branching in a hypothetical tree of the animal kingdom. This traditional tree was based mainly on the anatomical features of the animals and on certain details of their embryonic development. However, the molecular systematics of the past decade is challenging some of these long-held ideas about the phylogenetic relationships among the animal phyla.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Throughout this unit of chapters on the diversity of life, we have seen many cases where molecular data are enabling systematists to refine hypotheses about the history of life. Just a few examples are the splitting of prokaryotes into the archaea and the bacteria (Chapter 27), the reassessment of phylogenetic relationships among the protists (Chapter 28), reinforcement of the hypothesis that plants descended from the green algae called charophyceans (Chapter 29), progress in identifying the major clades (evolutionary branches) of flowering plants (Chapter 30), and the revelation that Fungi is the kingdom most closely related to the animal kingdom (Chapter 31). Thus, it probably doesn’t surprise you that molecular systematics is beginning to reshape our view of animal diversity.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
