NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS: PARASITISM AND PREDATION BY PLANTS

 

 Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants



 

 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals



Symbiotic nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae underscore the relationship between plants and their environment, which includes the other organisms that interact with plants. We conclude this chapter by exploring predation and parasitism as two other types of plant adaptations that enhance nutrition through interactions with other organisms.
