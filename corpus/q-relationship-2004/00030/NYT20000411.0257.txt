WASHINGTON --
Unable to persuade Congress to pass gun-control legislation , President Clinton is taking his campaign to the states , urging them to impose safety latches , background checks , and other restrictions on gun use .
But an analysis of state gun-related legislation shows that Clinton 's success has been spotty , at best .
And the governor of Colorado , where Clinton is traveling Wednesday , does n't think the president 's appearance will help in passing a gun-control referendum , said Dick Wadhamf , spokesman for Colorado Governor Bill Owens .
`` President Clinton 's visit politicizes the Columbine tragedy , '' said Wadhamf , referring to the school shooting last April 20 .
`` What President Clinton wants to do is to come to Colorado for a political rally to draw attention to his effort to influence the Republicans in Congress . ''
Wadhamf said Owens , a Republican , would have preferred that Clinton come to his state next week , for one of the memorials marking the first anniversary of the shooting .
Owens , once an adamant foe of gun control , backs passage of a state referendum that would require background checks of people who buy weapons at gun shows .
But `` President Clinton has some very high negatives '' in Colorado voter polls , Wadhamf said .
`` The fact is , his presence might actually hurt the initiative . ''
Clinton had been invited to `` a slew '' of Columbine memorials next week , but decided to attend Wednesday 's rally `` so this type of tragedy wo n't happen again , '' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert .
`` The president 's not running for anything .
But he can focus on issues that affect the American family . ''
In a few states , Clinton and gun-control advocates have had some success in passing restrictions , according to the Arlington , Va. -based firm StateScape , which tracks state legislation .
But foes of gun control have been far more successful , keeping anti-gun legislation stalled in committee and passing legislation that protects the industry , said John Grant , a StateScape legislative analyst .
`` The gun-control people are not getting what they want , '' Grant said .
On the gun-control side , California last year passed a series of gun restrictions .
Massachusetts recently instituted restrictions on new handguns sold in the state , requiring them to have tamper-proof serial numbers , trigger locks , and other safety devices .
But the Massachusetts rules were not imposed by legislation .
Attorney General Thomas Reilly was able to regulate the guns without legislative approval , instead using the state 's consumer protection law .
Clinton Tuesday traveled to Annapolis , Md. , to attend the signing ceremony for the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000 , which imposes new safety requirements on firearms sold in Marlyland .
It was the first time the president has attended a signing for a state law .
`` I hope that the United States Congress is paying attention to this event today , '' Clinton said after Maryland Governor Parris Glendening signed the bill .
But in many more states , it has been the National Rifle Association that has been winning over legislatures .
The group and their supporters have been overwhelmingly successful in getting laws passed that prohibit cities from suing gun manufacturers without the consent of their state legislatures , which tend to be more conservative .
Some of the laws go further in the area of tort reform , protecting gun makers from lawsuits that would hold them liable for gun violence .
The legislation is critical because it goes straight to the heart of the gun maker 's business : the ability to sell weapons .
It also puts a crimp in a strategy employed by gun-control advocates to force firearms manufacturers to adopt safety restrictions voluntarily , or else face a lengthy , expensive court battle .
Allowing cities to sue manufacturers `` sets a very bad precedent '' that could encourage other such lawsuits against a range of industries , said NRA spokesman James D. Manown .
`` They 've closed the City Hall door to gun-control advocates , '' said Joe Sudbay , political director of Handgun Control Inc. , based in Washington .
`` Now they 're trying to close the courthouse doors to the cities . ''
Some 14 states passed such `` lawsuit pre-emption '' laws last year ; Utah adopted the law in March ; Virginia and Kentucky adopted the rule this month , and in two states -- Colorado and Idaho -- the bill is awaiting the governor 's signature .
Wadhamf said Owens had not yet decided whether he would sign the Colorado bill .
In numerous other states , bills imposing background checks , minimum age requirements , and even prohibiting the sale of ammunition to intoxicated people are languishing in committee , Grant said .
The Colorado initiative arose because the legislature refused to pass some gun restrictions Owens pushed after the Columbine massacre .
That is typical in a state where there is not a large urban population , Grant said .
But gun-control advocates insist that where legislatures disappoint them , the people will come through for gun restrictions .
`` Just put it on a ballot , '' Sudbay said , `` and we 'll win . ''
