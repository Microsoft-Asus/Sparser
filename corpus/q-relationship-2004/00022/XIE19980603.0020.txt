UNHCR has reinforced staff in Guinea and Liberia and is rushing in food , blankets , and jerrycans ahead of the rainy season .
It is also working with other relief organizations to set up health , water , medical and social services in the camps .
`` The people who fled Sierra Leone are in terrible shape , and we have to do all in our power to help them , '' said Soren Jessen - Petersen , UNHCR 's Assistant High Commissioner who visited the victims of atrocities and refugee camps in the border area in Guinea at the weekend .
