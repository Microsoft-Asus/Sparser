In fact, natural selection</span> does <span class="Emphasis1">act on individuals; their characteristics affect their chances of survival and their reproductive success. But the evolutionary impact of this natural selection is only apparent in tracking how a</span>population <span class="Emphasis1">of organisms changes over time. Consider, for example, representatives from a population of marine snails</span> (Liguus fascitus) <span class="Emphasis1">in the photograph above. Their different patterns of coloration represent genetic variations within that population. If predators feed preferentially on snails having a particular coloration, then the proportion of individuals with that coloration probably will decline from one generation to the next because such snails will produce fewer offspring. Thus, it is the population, not its individuals, that evolves; some characteristics become more common within the overall population, while other characteristics decline</span>. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.1</span> (p. 446) <span class="Emphasis1">illustrates another example of this principle. Evolution on the smallest scale, or microevolution, can be defined as a change in the allele frequencies of a population (see p. 249 to review the definition of alleles). We begin our study of microevolution by tracing how biologists finally began to understand Darwin’s theory of natural selection during the first half of the 20th century</span>.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-1','../fig/big/fig23-1.jpg','fig23-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-1.jpg" alt="fig23-1" name="myfig23-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Individuals are selected, but populations evolve.</span> The bent grass <span class="Emphasis1">(Agrostis tenuis)</span> in the foreground is growing on the tailings of an abandoned mine in Wales. These plants tolerate concentrations of heavy metals that are toxic to other plants of the same species growing just meters away, in the pasture on the other side of the fence. Each year, many seeds land on the mine tailings, but most are unable to grow successfully there. The only plants that germinate, grow, and reproduce are those that inherited genes enabling them to tolerate metallic soil. Thus, this adaptation does not evolve by individual plants becoming more metal-tolerant during their lifetimes. We can only see the evolution of this population by observing the proportions of metal-tolerant plants in successive generations.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
