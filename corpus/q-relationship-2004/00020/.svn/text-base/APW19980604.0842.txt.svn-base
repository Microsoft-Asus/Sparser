GENEVA
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who rushed Thursday to join an emergency meeting of the world 's five official nuclear powers , characterized the recent nuclear testing by rival neighbors India and Pakistan as `` uniquely dangerous . ''
She and the foreign ministers of Russia , China , France and Britain were prepared to unite behind the common goal of defusing nuclear tension on the Asian subcontinent , she said .
Carrying instructions from President Bill Clinton , Albright also intended to revive the global arms control agenda staggered by last month 's atomic tests .
The five major powers were working on a communique that would offer mediation services and emphasize the urgency of India 's and Pakistan 's rejoining the global arms-control movement , said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
While nuclear weapons have been around since 1945 , the actions of Pakistan and India mark the first time that the longtime rivals , who share a common border , have escalated their potential for conflict to the nuclear level , Albright said .
First on the agenda at the meeting at U.N. headquarters in Geneva was reducing tension .
The U.S. delegation planned to raise a range of proposals , from convincing India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear tests to the possibility of international mediation over the disputed Kashmir region .
`` Right now , the most important thing both sides can do is to cool it and take a deep breath and begin to climb out of the hole they have dug themselves into , '' Albright said .
Albright met with the meeting 's chairman Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and also separately with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov early Thursday in preparation of the hastily arranged joint session .
Just what leverage the five nuclear nations have to induce Pakistan and India to cooperate was unclear .
U.S. officials were frank in acknowledging that sanctions , or the threat of sanctions , failed to prevent India and Pakistan from testing their weapons .
At the same time , the Clinton administration is no mood to offer incentives or rewards to two countries that have thrown the arms control and counter-proliferation agenda into disarray .
`` It would be highly ironic and unacceptable if we were to provide to those who have broken the rules some benefits that do not accrue to those who have willingly given it up , '' Albright said earlier in Washington .
She was referring to South Africa , Ukraine , Belarus , Kazakstan , Brazil and Argentina -- countries that have renounced their nuclear weapons programs .
Albright laid out three goals for the five powers to pursue : _Convince India and Pakistan to refrain from further testing , from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and from further inflammatory rhetoric .
_Avert a regional arms race in south Asia and ease tension over Kashmir .
_Convince both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and agree to a proposed treaty that would ban the production of `` fissile materials '' -- plutonium and highly enriched uranium -- needed to make nuclear weapons .
