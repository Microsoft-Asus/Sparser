-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Russia 's Foreign Ministry praised Japan 's likely choice for prime minister on Friday .
Japan 's governing party lawmakers picked Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi to head the Liberal Democratic Party .
He needs the approval of the lower house of parliament to become prime minister , but that is almost guaranteed since the LDP has a majority there .
`` We praise Keizo Obuchi 's contribution to the development of Russian - Japanese relations , '' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin .
Obuchi has played a prominent role in improving Japan 's relationship with Russia .
The two countries have never signed a treaty ending World War II because of a disagreement over four islands in the Kuril chain that were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war but are still claimed by Japan .
