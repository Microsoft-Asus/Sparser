INTRODUCTION TO THE PROTISTS

 

 Systematists have split protists into many kingdoms



 

 Protists are the most diverse of all eukaryotes



In Chapter 26, we discussed eukaryotic fossils that are 2.1 billion years old and "chemical signatures" characteristic of eukaryotes dating back 2.7 billion years. For about 2 billion years before there were animals, fungi, and plants, the early eukaryotes gave rise to a great diversity of the mostly microscopic organisms we know by the informal name "protists."
