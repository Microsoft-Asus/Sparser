Chapter 46: ANIMAL REPRODUCTION

OVERVIEW OF ANIMAL REPRODUCTION

   Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur in the animal kingdom

   Diverse mechanisms of asexual reproduction enable animals to produce identical offspring rapidly

   Reproductive cycles and patterns vary extensively among animals



MECHANISMS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

   Internal and external fertilization both depend on mechanisms ensuring that mature sperm encounter fertile eggs of the same species

   Species with internal fertilization usually produce fewer zygotes but provide more parental protection than species with external fertilization

   Complex reproductive systems have evolved in many animal phyla



MAMMALIAN REPRODUCTION

   Human reproduction involves intricate anatomy and complex behavior

   Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve meiosis but differ in three significant ways

   A complex interplay of hormones regulates reproduction

   Embryonic and fetal development occur during pregnancy in humans and other eutherian (placental) mammals

   Modern technology offers solutions for some reproductive problems

The many aspects of animal form and function we have studied so far can be viewed, in the broadest context, as adaptations contributing to reproductive success. Individuals are transient. A population transcends finite life spans only by reproduction, the creation of new individuals from existing ones. The two earthworms in the photograph above are mating. Unless disturbed, they will remain above the ground and joined like this for several hours. Each worm produces both sperm and eggs, each donates and receives sperm during mating, and each will produce fertilized eggs. In a few weeks, sexual reproduction will be completed when many new individuals hatch from the eggs.

Animal reproduction is the subject of this chapter. We will first compare the diverse reproductive mechanisms that have evolved in the animal kingdom, and then examine the details of mammalian, particularly human, reproduction.
