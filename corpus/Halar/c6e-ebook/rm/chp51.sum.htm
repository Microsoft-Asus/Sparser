A cognitive map, or internal representation of the spatial relationships among objects in their surroundings, is a more powerful navigatory mechanism.

Some animals have dominance hierarchies, in which high-ranking individuals gain preferential access to resources. Territoriality is a behavior in which an animal defends a specific, fixed portion of its home range against intrusion by other animals of the same species.</p></LI><LI><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Natural selection favors mating behavior that mazimizes the quantity or quality of mating partners (pp. 1140-1142,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 51.23</span>-<span class="SmallCap">51.25</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Courtship functions to identify that two individuals are of the same species and are ready to breed. The full elaboration of courtship is due to sexual selection, particularly female choice. During courtship, a male may display his genetic quality and (in species with parental care) his readiness for parental care. The mating system of a species consists of the way in which males and females associate for breeding; mating systems may be promiscuous, monogamous, or polygamous, depending partly on the parental investment made by males and females.</p></LI><LI><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Social interactions depend on diverse modes of communication (pp. 1142-1144,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 51.26</span>, <span class="SmallCap">51.27</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Animals communicate by means of signals, in which the behavior of one individual leads to a change in the behavior of another individual.</p><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity51A:<span class="Emphasis1">
