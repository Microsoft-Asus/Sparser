-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Russia launched the world 's first satellite into space Tuesday using a missile fired from a submarine .
The German Tubsat - N satellite was put into orbit by a RSM -54 intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a Novomoskovsk submarine in the Barents Sea , Russian news reports said , quoting navy officials .
Russian officials said it was the Navy 's first commercial space launch .
But U.S. space analysts said it was the first time any nation had launched a satellite into orbit from a submarine .
The launch was made while the sub was submerged , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported , and TV footage showed the rocket firing out of the ocean and into the sky .
The 10-kilogram -LRB- 22-pound -RRB- satellite , developed by the Berlin Technical University , will provide communication services and also help count animals and relay other ecological information , the reports said .
The RSM -54 missile , which is called SS - N -23 in the West , is a standard weapon of Russian nuclear-powered submarines .
The U.S. Navy has used submarines to launch sub-orbital rockets for delivery of bombs or weapons , but has not launched satellites into orbit .
