Moments after EgyptAir flight 990 suddenly , mysteriously dropped from the sky at about 1 : 50 Sunday morning , the complex -- but by now familiar -- search for a plane at sea , and for an explanation of why it went down , was under way .
Alerted by the Federal Aviation Administration when the plane disappeared from its radar screens , Coast Guard search planes and helicopters lifted off in darkness from Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod at 2 : 15 a.m .
By late Sunday afternoon , four Coast Guard cutters and 11 planes were methodically criss-crossing a 36 square mile search area 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island .
A `` Go Team '' of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board -- the lead agency in the inquiry -- flew out of Washington as the nucleus of an investigation that will draw on a half-dozen federal agencies , including U.S. Navy deep-sea divers .
Two FBI agents were already aboard the Coast Guard ships supervising the gathering of debris that could be evidence .
`` We are beginning what may be a long investigation and we are prepared to do what it takes , '' James Hall , chairman of the safety board , told a news conference in outlining the initial steps .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In many ways the template for the investigation was set by the arduous investigation , still not fully completed , into the crash of Trans World Airlines flight 800 south of Long Island , N.Y. , in July 1996 .
But the TWA 800 investigation -- which developed into contentious clashes between the FBI and safety board investigators over whether the plane was brought down by terrorists or a mechanical failure -- has also apparently provided lessons of what not to do .
Ultimately , it was determined that fuel vapors in the nearly empty center fuel tank ignited in an explosion .</ENAMEX>
On Sunday , from officials at the White House to the investigators giving limited public briefings on the crash , there was much cautioning about not leaping to conclusions that terrorism might be involved , even though Egypt has a long history of fatal blows struck by Islamic fundamentalists .
And the FBI appeared to be deliberately keeping a low profile .
Indeed , when several high-ranking FBI officials arrived at the safety board 's news conference in Washington , Hall asked them not to appear on the podium .
`` We have no threats , we have no one claiming responsibility , '' said FBI spokesman Jim Davis , one of a number of agents who , publicly and privately , stressed that the FBI is routinely involved in the initial stages of these investigations in case it later turns into a criminal matter .
`` We have to follow the rules of evidence , the chain of evidence , '' said Special Agent Barry Mawn , who is supervising the Boston -based agents as they catalog the debris .
`` So we work that right from the get-go . ''
Behind the scenes , however , the FBI opened its Strategic Information and Operations Center in the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington , a secure command center packed with classified computers and communications gear , an indication that the crash was regarded as a potentially serious matter .
A similar command center that houses the Joint Terrorism Task Force run by the FBI in New York was also activated , and agents in New York began to examine the passenger manifest and to question the workers at Kennedy Airport who might have had access to the ill-fated Boeing 767 carrying 217 people .
Hall , emphasizing that the investigation was `` in it 's early hours , '' warned that any reports of the cause of the crash `` will be speculation . ''
The investigation is to be headed by Gregory Phillips , an 11-year safety board veteran .
In addition to the FBI and Coast Guard , it will also include the FAA , the Defense Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , as well as teams from Boeing and Pratt and Whitney , the manufacturer of the plane 's engines .
The investigative teams will include experts on , among other things , aircraft structure and systems , engines , air traffic control and human performance .
Because the plane went down in international waters , Egypt , the country to which the airliner was registered , bore responsibility for investigating the crash .
But Egyptian officials quickly agreed to let the Americans run the inquiry , although the United States was not obligated to .
An EgyptAir team , headed by the national carrier 's president , Mohammed Fahim Rayan , is flying from Cairo to join the inquiry .
Officials made clear Sunday that the first priority for determining what happened to the plane was the recovery of the airliner 's `` black boxes , '' the voice and data recorders that chart every step of a plane 's journey and functioning .
While the recorders were only of limited help in the TWA 800 investigation -- the recordings shut off abruptly , and without having provided conclusive information , at the instant of the explosion -- officials said Sunday that the recorders in the EgyptAir plane were significantly more sophisticated and comprehensive in their tracking of performance .
Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast Guard , who is directing the initial search-and-rescue operation , said that the required sonar and diving gear was being loaded onto his ships , and that with the arrival on Tuesday of a Navy ship , the USS Grapple , investigators would be in a position to retrieve the boxes .
The arrival of the Grapple was delayed by the initial , brief concern over which country would run the investigation .
The Coast Guard said that , as of Sunday night , it had recovered only one body , along with seat cushions and partially inflated life rafts .
In the TWA 800 case , the Navy spent weeks and then months methodically charting and recovering wreckage -- the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board virtually rebuilt the fuselage from the scraps -- a pattern that is likely to be repeated this time , at least until enough evidence is found to indicate a cause , either mechanical or criminal .
In most jetliner crashes , there is at least some communication with the ground , some hint of what went wrong .
But in a few cases , like TWA 800 -- and now EgyptAir 990 -- there is simply a plane flying normally on its course and suddenly plunging into the sea .
In this case , no one yet knows if there was an explosion -- so far there are no witnesses and it is unlikely there will be -- or perhaps some other calamity , like a cargo door opening .
At its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet , a jet 's hull is pressurized to provide adequate air to passengers and crew .
The air pressure inside is typically eight pounds per square inch higher than the air pressure outside , said a federal investigator who worked on the TWA 800 inquiry , so that any breach of the hull causes air to blast outward , and could rip the plane apart .
It was the fourth time in three years that a major search operation was launched in the region for a plane lost at sea .
In addition to TWA 800 , there was the crash of Swissair flight 111 off Nova Scotia in September 1998 , and of the single-engine plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. , his wife and her sister off Martha 's Vineyard in July .
