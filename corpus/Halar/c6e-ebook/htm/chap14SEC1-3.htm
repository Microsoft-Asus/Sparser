The human generation span is about 20 years, and human parents produce relatively few offspring compared to peas and most other species. Furthermore, breeding experiments like the ones Mendel performed are unacceptable with humans. In spite of these difficulties, the study of human genetics continues to advance, powered by the incentive to understand our own inheritance. New techniques in molecular biology have led to many breakthrough discoveries, as we will see in Chapter 20, but basic Mendelism endures as the foundation of human genetics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
