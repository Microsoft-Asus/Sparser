HUMAN IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THE BIOSPHERE

 

 The human population is disrupting chemical cycles throughout the biosphere



 

 Combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of acid precipitation



 

 Toxins can become concentrated in successive trophic levels of food webs



 

 Human activities may be causing climate change by increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere



 

 Human activities are depleting atmospheric ozone



As the human population has grown in size, our activities and technological capabilities have intruded in one way or another into the dynamics of most ecosystems. Even where we have not completely destroyed a natural system, our actions have disrupted the trophic structure, energy flow, and chemical cycling of ecosystems in most areas of the world. The effects are sometimes local or regional, but the ecological impact of humans can be widespread or even global. For example, acidic gases may be carried by prevailing winds and fall as acid rain hundreds or thousands of miles from the smokestacks emitting the gases.
