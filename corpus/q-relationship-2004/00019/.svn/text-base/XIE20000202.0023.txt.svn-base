TEHRAN , February 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday called for unity and solidarity among various political factions to create tranquil atmosphere for the coming parliamentary elections on February 18 .
`` The people 's aspirations and wishes will be realized only through solidarity and unity , '' Khamenei told a group of people who visited him on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
He termed the prevalence of calm and tranquility in the country as a prerequisite for holding the elections and called for a '' massive and enthusiastic '' turnout of eligible voters in the elections .
The Iranian leader also called on the moderate Interior Ministry to abide by the law and prevent betrayal of the people 's trusts and votes and the conservative Guardians Council to refrain `` wishers '' from being elected , the Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
Iranian rival political parties have kicked off their election campaigns with white-hot quarrels against each other aiming at grasping more seats in the country 's powerful legislative body .
Factional struggles reached the peak in recent weeks as a sharp split erupted inside the moderate coalition between the leftists who support the reformist President Mohammad Khatami and the central-rightists who are followers of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani .
The central-rightists led by the Party of Constructive Executives of Iran -LRB- PCEI -RRB- strongly support Rafsanjani in his efforts to win the parliamentary poll , which is believed to create a new power balance in the country .
Rafsanjani , who had served as the Majlis -LRB- parliament -RRB- speaker for 10 years before he was elected president in 1989 , is widely believed to be the next Majlis Speaker if he wins a seat in the parliament .
However , the leftists , who were isolated during Rafsanjani 's presidency , considered his nomination as a hindrance for Khatami 's reform course because of his close links with the conservatives , particularly his relations with Khamenei .
Local newspaper Resalat said on Wednesday that the crack might encourage the leftists to form a new coalition by excluding the central-rightist groups .
The powerful conservatives , who dominate most of the country 's important state organs and had ever put grave pressures on Rafsanjani 's government , lined up in recent weeks behind Rafsanjani by blaming the leftists as `` extremists . ''
Political analysts said that the chaotic factional struggles might disappoint the people who hope the new parliament will help President Khatami push forward his reform programs .
The result of the elections will be unpredictable with the spiraling quarrels and possible emergence of new coalitions , they said .
