Ranging in size from only about 0.05 to 2.0 mm, smaller than many protists, rotifers are nevertheless truly multicellular and have specialized organ systems (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.13</span>). In contrast to cnidarians and flatworms, which have gastrovascular cavities, rotifers have a <span class="Emphasis2">complete digestive tract,</span> which is a digestive tube with a separate mouth and anus. Internal organs lie within the pseudocoelom, a body cavity that is not completely lined by mesoderm (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.6b</span>). Fluid in the pseudocoelom serves as a hydrostatic skeleton and as a medium for the internal transport of nutrients and wastes in these tiny animals. Movement of a rotifer’s body distributes the fluid within the pseudocoelom, and thus this body cavity and its fluid function as a circulatory system.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-13','../fig/big/fig33-13.jpg','fig33-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-13.jpg" alt="fig33-13" name="myfig33-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A rotifer.</span> These pseudocoelomates, smaller than many protists, are much more anatomically complex than flatworms (LM).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The word <span class="Emphasis1">rotifer</span>, derived from Latin, means "wheel-bearer," a reference to the crown of cilia that draws a vortex of water into the mouth.

Some species consist only of females that produce more females from unfertilized eggs, a type of reproduction called <span class="Emphasis2">parthenogenesis.</span> Other species produce two types of eggs that develop by parthenogenesis, one type forming females and the other type developing into degenerate males that cannot even feed themselves. The males survive long enough to produce sperm that fertilize eggs, forming resistant zygotes that can survive when a pond dries up. When conditions are favorable again, the zygotes break dormancy and develop into a new female generation that then reproduces by parthenogenesis until conditions become unfavorable again.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
