Birds and mammals can also change the rate of metabolic heat production. Insulation, vasodilation, vasoconstriction, and countercurrent heat exchangers alter the rate of heat exchange. Panting, sweating, and bathing increase evaporation.</p></LI><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Most animals are ectothermic, but endothermy is widespread (pp. 930-935,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 44.6</span>-<span class="SmallCap">44.10</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Some large active insects and fishes generate metabolic heat by muscle contractions, and many retain it by countercurrent heat exchanges. Some invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles maintain tolerable internal temperatures by behavioral means. Thermoregulatory mechanisms in mammals and birds include shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis; insulation by fat, hair, or feathers; panting; and countercurrent heat exchange.</p></LI><LI><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Torpor conserves energy during environmental extremes (pp. 935-936,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 44.11</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Torpor involves a decrease in metabolic, heart, and respiratory rates and enables the animal to temporarily withstand unfavorable temperatures or lack of food and water.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">WATER BALANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Water balance and waste disposal depend on transport epithelia (p. 936,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 44.12</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Specialized cell layers regulate the solute movements required for waste disposal and for tempering changes in body fluids.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">An animal’s nitrogenous wastes are correlated with its phylogeny and habitat (pp. 936-938,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 44.13</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Protein and nucleic acid metabolism generates ammonia, a toxic waste product excreted in three forms. Most aquatic animals excrete ammonia across the body surface or gill epithelia into the surrounding water. The liver of mammals and most adult amphibians converts ammonia to the less-toxic urea, which is carried to the kidneys, concentrated, and excreted with a minimal loss of water. Uric acid is an insoluble precipitate excreted in the pastelike urine of land snails, insects, birds, and many reptiles.</p></LI><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cells require a balance between osmotic gain and loss of water (pp. 938-939)</span> Water uptake and loss are balanced by various mechanisms of osmoregulation in different environments.</p></LI><LI><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Osmoregulators expend energy to control their internal osmolarity; osmoconformers are isoosmotic with their surroundings (pp. 939-941,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 44.14</span>-<span class="SmallCap">44.16</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Osmoconformers, which do not regulate their osmolarity, include most marine invertebrates. Osmoregulators control water uptake and loss in a hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic environment. Sharks have an osmolarity slightly higher than seawater because they retain urea. Marine bony fishes lose water to their hyperosmotic environment and drink seawater. Marine vertebrates excrete excess salt through rectal glands, gills, salt-excreting glands, or kidneys. Freshwater animals, which constantly take in water from their hypoosmotic environment, excrete dilute urine. Salt loss is replaced by eating or by ion uptake by gills. Terrestrial animals combat desiccation by behavioral adaptations, water-conserving excretory organs, and by drinking and eating food with high water content.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">EXCRETORY SYSTEMS</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Most excretory systems produce urine by refining a filtrate derived from body fluids: <span class="Emphasis1">an overview</span> (pp. 941-942,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 44.17</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Key functions of most excretory systems are filtration (pressure-filtering of body fluids, producing a filtrate) and the production of urine from the filtrate by reabsorption, (reclaiming valuable solutes from the filtrate) and secretion (addition of toxins and other solutes from the body fluids to the filtrate).</p></LI><LI><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Diverse excretory systems are variations on a tubular theme (pp. 942-944,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 44.18</span>-<span class="SmallCap">44.20</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Extracellular fluid is filtered into the protonephridia of the flame-bulb system in flatworms; these tubules excrete a dilute fluid and also function in osmoregulation. Each segment of an earthworm has a pair of open-ended metanephridia, tubules that collect coelomic fluid and produce dilute urine for excretion. In insects, Malpighian tubules function in osmoregulation and removal of nitrogenous wastes from the hemolymph. Insects produce a relatively dry waste matter, an important adaptation to terrestrial life. Kidneys, the excretory organs of vertebrates, function in both excretion and osmoregulation.</p></LI><LI><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Nephrons and associated blood vessels are the functional units of the mammalian kidney (pp. 944-947,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 44.21</span> and <span class="SmallCap">44.22</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Excretory tubules (consisting of nephrons and collecting ducts) and associated blood vessels pack the kidney. Fluid from several nephrons flows into a collecting duct. A ureter conveys urine from the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder. Nephrons control the composition of the blood by filtration, secretion, and reabsorption. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but not to salt; water moves by osmosis into the hyperosmotic interstitial fluid. Salt diffuses out of the concentrated filtrate as it moves through the salt-permeable ascending limb of the loop of Henle.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity44A:<span class="Emphasis1">

Urea also diffuses out of the tubule and, with salt, forms the osmotic gradient that enables the kidney to produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the blood. The osmolarity of the urine is regulated by nervous system and hormonal control of water and salt reabsorption in the kidneys. This regulation involves the actions of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF).</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity44C:<span class="Emphasis1">
