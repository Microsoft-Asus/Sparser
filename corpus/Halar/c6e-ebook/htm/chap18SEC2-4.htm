Research on phages led to the discovery that some double-stranded DNA viruses can reproduce by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.</p><p class="Header3">The Lytic Cycle</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">A phage reproductive cycle that culminates in death of the host cell is known as a <span class="Emphasis2">lytic cycle.</span> The term refers to the last stage of infection, during which the bacterium lyses (breaks open) and releases the phages that were produced within the cell. Each of these phages can then infect a healthy cell, and a few successive lytic cycles can destroy an entire bacterial colony in just hours. A phage that reproduces only by a lytic cycle is a <span class="Emphasis2">virulent phage.</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 18.4</span> (p. 332) uses the virulent phage T4 to illustrate the steps of a lytic cycle. The figure and legend describe the process, which you should study before proceeding.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig18-4','../fig/big/fig18-4.jpg','fig18-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig18-4.jpg" alt="fig18-4" name="myfig18-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 18-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The lytic cycle of phage T4.</span> Phage T4 has about 100 genes, which are transcribed and translated using the host cell’s machinery. One of the first phage genes translated after infection codes for an enzyme that chops up the host cell’s DNA (step 3); the phage DNA is protected from breakdown because it contains a modified form of cytosine that is not recognized by the enzyme. The entire lytic cycle, from the phage’s first contact with the cell surface to cell lysis, takes only 20-30 minutes at 37&#176;C.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">After reading about the lytic cycle, you may wonder why phages haven’t exterminated all bacteria. Actually, bacteria are not defenseless. Natural selection favors bacterial mutants with receptor sites that are no longer recognized by a particular type of phage. And when phage DNA successfully enters a bacterium, various cellular enzymes may break it down. Enzymes called <span class="Emphasis1">restriction nucleases,</span> for example, recognize and cut up DNA that is foreign to the cell, including certain phage DNA. The bacterial cell’s own DNA is chemically modified in a way that prevents attack by restriction enzymes. But just as natural selection favors bacteria with effective restriction enzymes, natural selection favors phage mutants that are resistant to these enzymes. Thus, the parasite-host relationship is in constant evolutionary flux.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">There is still another important reason bacteria have been spared from extinction as a result of phage activity. Many phages can check their own destructive tendencies and, instead of lysing their host cells, coexist with them in what is called the lysogenic cycle.</p><p class="Header3">The Lysogenic Cycle</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">In contrast to the lytic cycle, which kills the host cell, the <span class="Emphasis2">lysogenic cycle</span> replicates the phage genome without destroying the host. Phages that are capable of using both modes of reproducing within a bacterium are called <span class="Emphasis2">temperate phages.</span> To compare the lytic and lysogenic cycles, we will examine a temperate phage called lambda, written with the Greek letter <span class="symbol">l</span>. Phage <span class="symbol">l</span> resembles T4, but its tail has only one short tail fiber.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Infection of an <span class="Emphasis1">E. coli</span> cell by phage <span class="symbol">l</span> begins when the phage binds to the surface of the cell and injects its DNA (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 18.5</span>). Within the host, the <span class="symbol">l</span> DNA molecule forms a circle. What happens next depends on the reproductive mode: lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle. During a lytic cycle, the viral genes immediately turn the host cell into a <span class="symbol">l</span>-producing factory, and the cell soon lyses and releases its viral products. The viral genome behaves differently during a lysogenic cycle. The <span class="symbol">l</span> DNA molecule is incorporated by genetic recombination (crossing over) into a specific site on the host cell’s chromosome. It is then known as a <span class="Emphasis2">prophage.</span> One prophage gene codes for a protein that represses most of the other prophage genes. (This is the repressor protein Nancy Hopkins studied as a graduate student; see p. 232.) Thus, the phage genome is mostly silent within the bacterium. How, then, does the phage reproduce? Every time the <span class="Emphasis1">E. coli</span> cell prepares to divide, it replicates the phage DNA along with its own and passes the copies on to daughter cells. A single infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form. This mechanism enables viruses to propagate without killing the host cells on which they depend.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig18-5','../fig/big/fig18-5.jpg','fig18-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig18-5.jpg" alt="fig18-5" name="myfig18-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 18-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The lysogenic and lytic reproductive cycles of phage <span class="symbol">l</span>, a temper-ate phage.</span> After entering the bacterial cell and circularizing, the <span class="symbol">l</span> DNA can either integrate into the bacterial chromosome (lysogenic cycle) or immediately initiate the production of a large number of progeny phages (lytic cycle).

This occurs when, occasionally, the <span class="symbol">l</span> genome exits the bacterial chromosome. Once free in the cell, the <span class="symbol">l</span> genome initiates a lytic cycle. It is usually an environmental trigger, such as radiation or the presence of certain chemicals, that switches the virus from the lysogenic to the lytic mode.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">In addition to the gene for the repressor protein, a few other prophage genes may also be expressed during lysogenic cycles, and the expression of these genes may alter the phenotype of the host bacteria. This phenomenon can have important medical significance. For example, the bacteria that cause the human diseases diphtheria, botulism, and scarlet fever would be harmless to humans if it were not for certain prophage genes that induce the host bacteria to make toxins.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
