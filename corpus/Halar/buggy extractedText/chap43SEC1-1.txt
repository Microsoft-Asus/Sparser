NONSPECIFIC DEFENSES AGAINST INFECTION

 

 The skin and mucous membranes provide first-line barriers to infection



 

 Phagocytic cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins function early in infection



An invading microbe must penetrate the external barrier formed by the skin and mucous membranes, which cover the surface and line the openings of an animal's body. If it succeeds in doing so, the pathogen encounters the second line of nonspecific defense, interacting mechanisms that include phagocytosis, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins.
