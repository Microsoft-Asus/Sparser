WASHINGTON --
Although the former director of central intelligence , John Deutch , had his security clearances revoked by the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency , he has kept a security clearance at the Pentagon , a senior Defense Department official says .
Deutch 's intelligence clearances were revoked last year because he had violated security rules by keeping classified information on computers at his house that were connected to the Internet , making them vulnerable to entry by hackers .
The Pentagon has not taken similar action in part because it has not been given the CIA 's report that resulted in the action against Deutch , the Defense Department official said .
The Pentagon asked for the report some time ago , the official said , but he added that he did not know exactly when .
Deutch 's case has received considerable attention since it was revealed last week that the CIA 's inspector general had concluded that top officials impeded an internal investigation into Deutch 's case .
In addition , members of Congress have questioned why Deutch was treated differently from Wen Ho Lee , a scientist at a weapons laboratory who has been accused of keeping nuclear secrets on an unsecure computer .
The current director of central intelligence , George Tenet , came under heavy questioning about his handling of the matter in two days of testimony last week .
Tenet said Deutch 's behavior was different because there was no evidence that he had intended to aid a foreign country .
Tenet acknowledged that his agency had been slow in notifying Congress and the Justice Department about Deutch 's case .
But in two days of congressional testimony , Tenet did not mention that Deutch had been allowed to keep a Pentagon security clearance .
The Pentagon disclosed it in answer to questions by The Washington Post , which reported it on Saturday .
The clearance is a limited one , a Pentagon official said , what he called an `` industrial clearance . ''
It allows Deutch to work on specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon , SAIC Corp. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where Deutch teaches .
The Pentagon official said the clearance did not give Deutch access to a wide range of intelligence information .
Deutch was the deputy secretary of defense , the No. 2 position at the Pentagon , from 1994 until May 1995 , when he was confirmed as director of central intelligence .
He sought to become secretary of defense in President Clinton 's second term , and when he did not get that post , he stepped down as head of the CIA in December 1996 .
Under agency regulations , Deutch should have turned over the computers he had at his home .
He told the agency he wanted to keep them to conduct personal banking , and he was allowed to keep them only after he managed to be hired as a consultant to the agency .
In a visit to Deutch 's home , in December 1996 , CIA security officials found classified documents on the computers .
Based on a follow-up investigation , Deutch 's security clearances were revoked by Tenet , denying him access to a wide range of intelligence information .
`` The charges and issues at hand were very serious , '' Tenet testified on Thursday in explaining why he had revoked Deutch 's security clearances .
`` I took a tough decision to indefinitely suspend John 's clearances . ''
Because of a reciprocal arrangement with the Defense Intelligence Agency , Deutch also lost his security clearance there , the Pentagon official said .
But Deutch kept the more limited security clearance .
The Pentagon official said a higher standard of proof was required before this clearance could be revoked , partly , he said , because it affected Deutch 's livelihood .
He added that the Pentagon had no evidence that Deutch had violated any security regulations when he had been at the Pentagon , and that the Pentagon had not seen the CIA 's evidence .
As a result , he said , there was no basis for revoking Deutch 's industrial clearance .
