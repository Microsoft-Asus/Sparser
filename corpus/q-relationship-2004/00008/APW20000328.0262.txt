The Tokyo District Court found that lawyer Yoshinobu Aoyama was involved in a botched attempt to kill Taro Takimoto , a lawyer representing victims of the cult , said a court official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Prosecutors have said the cult , Aum Shinri Kyo , used sarin and VX gas in the attack .
The cult 's guru , Shoko Asahara , is on trial for 17 counts of murder and attempted murder in the attack on Tokyo 's subway system that killed 12 people and injured thousands .
In 1994 , the cult tried several times to murder Takimoto , 43 , by spraying nerve gas on his car and the doorknob of his home , and by slipping poison in his drink .
Prosecutors said that Aoyama , 40 , relayed an order from Asahara to carry out the sarin attack on Takimoto , Kyodo News agency said .

Takimoto suffered eye injuries in the attack .
The cult recently changed its name to Aleph in an apparent move to ward off crackdowns by authorities .
The group has been under government surveillance and has been declared bankrupt , but it is believed to be raking in hidden profits from a computer software business .
