<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Campaigners against the use of children as soldiers launched a coalition Tuesday to press governments for strict international legal protection of under-18s .
`` The use of children as soldiers has no place in civilized society and must be stopped , '' said Stuart Maslen , coordinator of the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers .
The campaign , based near Geneva , is headed by a committee of six organizations , including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .</ENAMEX>
It estimates that more than 300,000 children worldwide under 18 years old are involved in armed conflicts , and at least as many again are in armed forces not currently fighting .
The launch came a day after the U.N. Security Council demanded an immediate end to the practice of arming children .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Organizers said the coalition is a response to the failure of negotiations to add to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child a non-binding resolution raising the age of participation in war to 18 from 15 .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In February , the United States was among countries that opposed an international move to make 18 the minimum age for young soldiers going to war</ENAMEX> .
Washington fears that the proposed new standard could constrain recruitment and training , and is skeptical about adding new norms when old ones are not respected .
The U.N. refugee agency welcomed the move to draw attention to `` children serving as cannon fodder in wars throughout the world . ''
`` Half of the refugee population worldwide are children , and refugee populations are probably one of the most exposed people , '' said Kris Janowski , spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees .
