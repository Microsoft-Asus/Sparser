The exponential growth equation <span class="Emphasis1">dN/dt</span> = <span class="Emphasis1">r<SUB>max</SUB>N</span> represents a population’s potential growth in an unlimited environment, where <span class="Emphasis1">r<SUB>max</SUB></span> is the maximum per capita rate of increase and <span class="Emphasis1">N</span> is the number of individuals in the population.

A more realistic population model limits growth by incorporating carrying capacity (<span class="Emphasis1">K</span>), the maximum population size that can be sustained by available resources. The logistic equation <span class="Emphasis1">dN</span>/<span class="Emphasis1">dt</span> = <span class="Emphasis1">r<SUB>max</SUB>N</span> (<span class="Emphasis1">K</span>-<span class="Emphasis1">N</span>)/<span class="Emphasis1">K</span> describes an S-shaped curve in which population growth levels off as population size approaches carrying capacity. This model fits some populations well, but for many natural populations, there is no stable carrying capacity, and populations fluctuate regularly or irregularly around some long-term average density. Natural selection will favor traits that allow survival and reproduction with few resources in populations that live at densities near carrying capacity (<span class="Emphasis1">K</span>), and this density-dependent selection is called <span class="Emphasis1">K</span> selection. Adaptations that promote rapid reproduction should be favored at low densities, and this form of natural selection is called <span class="Emphasis1">r</span>-selection.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">POPULATION-LIMITING FACTORS</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Negative feedback prevents unlimited population growth (pp. 1164-1165,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 52.14</span>-<span class="SmallCap">52.15</span><span class="Emphasis1">)</span> Density-dependent changes in birth and death rates act to curb population increase and can eventually stabilize a population near its carrying capacity.
