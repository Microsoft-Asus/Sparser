INTRODUCTION TO THE FUNGI

 

 Absorptive nutrition enables fungi to live as decomposers and symbionts



 

 Extensive surface area and rapid growth adapt fungi for absorptive nutrition



 

 Fungi disperse and reproduce by releasing spores that are produced sexually or asexually



 

 Many fungi have a heterokaryotic stage



Fungi are eukaryotes, and most are multicellular. Although fungi were once grouped with plants, they are unique organisms that generally differ from other eukaryotes in nutritional mode, structural organization, growth, and reproduction. In fact, molecular studies indicate that animals, not plants, are the closest relatives of fungi (see FIGURE 28.8).
