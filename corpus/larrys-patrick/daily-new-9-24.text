Morrell Park mourns the loss of 'the heart of this neighborhood'

FOR MUCH of the past 30 years, Patrick McDonald was the heart of Morrell Park.



At first glance, he was like a lot of guys 


from the tiny, tidy Northeast Philadelphia enclave


 - a tough, hard-nosed son of a fireman.


But as the years wore on, 


McDonald's friends watched in admiration as other qualities emerged.


He proved to be kind and generous, and had a knack for leadership


 - attributes that seemed to grow even stronger 


when he joined the Police Department eight years ago.


His neighbors

 - who were thrilled a few years ago when he bought the house he grew up in


 - considered him their son, brother, protector.


Yesterday, they wept for their fallen hero.


Word spread quickly 

up and down the winding, neatly manicured streets of Morrell Park 


after McDonald, 30, was fatally shot in North Philadelphia yesterday afternoon.


The neighborhood has long been home to cops and firefighters


, many of whom stopped what they were doing 


and ran outside to mourn together outside McDonald's home 


on Whitehall Lane near Crown Avenue.


One woman stopped on the sidewalk when she learned of McDonald's slaying 


and cried out, "Pat's dead! Oh, God, no!" 


Other neighbors quickly rushed to her side and joined in a tearful embrace.



"Everybody's devastated. He was the heart of this neighborhood," said Steve Mentusky


, a longtime friend who has spent much of the past year


 renovating McDonald's childhood home.


"It's going to be weird not seeing him coming out in the morning 


and getting on his police motorcycle. 


We're going to be crying around here for days."



McDonald, a 1996 Archbishop Ryan High School graduate, 


made a name for himself as an undersized lineman 


who played through pain on his high-school football team.


In fall 1995, McDonald earned second-team All-Catholic honors 


from the coaches in the Catholic League Northern Division.


"He always gave his all," said his old coach, Glen Galeone. 


"After games, he'd be totally drained. Really beat up.



"I remember that he played with a knee brace. 


Maybe even had a small tear in there. 


But you couldn't keep the kid off the field. 


That's how determined he was."



McDonald's father, Larry, retired from the Fire Department as a captain in 2004.


Neighbors said he was especially close to his mother, Patricia, and sister, Megan.


"We grew up together," said Sean Flanagan.


 "He had a huge heart and was like a brother to everyone around here."



Mentusky said McDonald had a top-shelf gym installed in his basement


, and a bar and a big-screen TV put on his back-yard deck.


"On Sundays," Flanagan said, 

"everyone around here would go to his house to watch Eagles games. 


He didn't care who you were, as long as you liked the Eagles."


McDonald - an avid weight lifter - 


added a sense of security in many of his neighbors' minds.



"We felt so protected to live on his street," said Barbara Covello


, as she wiped tears from her eyes. 


"This just can't be true."


As the afternoon wore on, cops and curious passers-by visited McDonald's block and paid respects.


A female cop sobbed hysterically when she broke the news of McDonald's slaying to her father


, who lived next door to McDonald.


"They shot him in the head and chest," she cried


, as other neighbors stood back and quietly wept.



McDonald spent three years taking night and weekend classes at St. Joseph's University


, where he earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice in 2005.



"He did love being a cop, and was thrilled when they put him in Highway Patrol about four years ago," 


said Cheltenham Police Sgt. Dan Farley


, who met McDonald in a St. Joe's criminal-justice class.


"He was dedicated. I expected him stay a cop and move up the ranks over time. 


I was pretty well stunned when I heard what happened to him," said Farley


, whose brother is a Philadelphia police detective.



Highway Patrol Capt. Michael Cochrane reflected last night


, while he and other officers waited to escort McDonald's body to a funeral home.


"He was a great cop, always running somebody down. 


This is a tremendous loss for us all," Cochrane said. *
