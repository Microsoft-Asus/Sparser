The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the membrane, away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, phospholipids are major components of cell membranes. This behavior provides another example of how form fits function at the molecular level.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
