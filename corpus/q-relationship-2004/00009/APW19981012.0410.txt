A new route to transport Caspian Sea oil to the West will be determined soon , pending clarification of `` technical details , '' Georgia 's president said Monday .
President Eduard Shevardnadze said in a television address that discussions on the new route have entered the final stage , the Interfax news agency reported .
Shevardnadze 's comments came after the New York Times reported Sunday that western oil companies are expected to announce Oct. 29 they will rely on Georgia 's new Baku - Supsa pipeline , which runs from the Caspian to the Black Sea through Azerbaijan and Georgia , to move most of their oil .
`` Georgia will feel the significance of that oil , '' Shevardnadze said , according to Interfax .
The Baku - Supsa pipeline will begin pumping oil by early 1999 , he said .
The United States government wants oil from the Caspian to flow through a longer , as-yet unbuilt pipeline across Azerbaijan , Georgia , and Turkey .
The U.S. thinks that pipeline would bind those countries closer to the West , and make an oil route across Russia and Iran less likely .
Caspian oil reserves are said to be the largest outside the Middle East , but they remain relatively untapped because countries with access to them have been struggling to get the expensive projects off the ground .
Meanwhile , Turkish leaders said Monday that the pipeline through Turkey would be built , insisting that the Bosporus Straits , through which any oil from the Georgian route would have to pass , are too crowded to manage the new flow of tankers .
