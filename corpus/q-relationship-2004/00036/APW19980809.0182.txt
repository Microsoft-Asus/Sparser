TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Taiwan and the United States have signed a bilateral agreement for the island 's accession to the World Trade Organization , news reports said Sunday .
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi -fu and U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy signed the pact in Washington Friday , after lengthy negotiations on tariff rates for 8,000 agricultural and industrial products , the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a statement .
Under the agreement , Taiwan will cut tariffs on many agricultural and industrial products , open up its telecommunications and financial services sectors , and enter into agreements on government procurement and civil aviation pacts sponsored by the World Trade Organization .
The liberalization of financial services will have long-term benefits , the Central News Agency quoted Taiwan Central Bank officials as saying .
To date , the island has signed trade agreements with 23 out of the 26 organization members that requested bilateral talks .
Hong Kong , Canada and the European Union still need to sign with Taiwan , the ministry added .
Taiwan has successfully negotiated with all members that objected to its bid to join the 132-member trade body .
Officials said they hope to enter the WTO early next year , but much depends on China 's attitude .
Relations across the Taiwan Strait have often been hostile since Chiang Kai -shek 's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to Mao Tse -tung 's Communists in 1949 .
