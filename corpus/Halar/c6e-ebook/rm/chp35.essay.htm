									<a name="para90"></a><p class="BlockText">The evolution of plant structure can be explored by looking at alternative growth strategies of related plants that occur in different environments. In this respect, Darwin was one of the earliest observers to note that many plant species with herbaceous growth forms on continental mainlands have woody tree-like relatives on remote oceanic islands. In the Hawaiian Islands, for example, one can find tree lobelias and tall, woody violets, groups that occur as small herbs in North America. Suggest an evolutionary hypothesis for this trend: Why is it so common for woody tree-like forms to evolve from herbaceous ancestors that colonize isolated islands?</p>
