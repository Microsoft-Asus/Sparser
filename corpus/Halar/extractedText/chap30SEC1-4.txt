PLANTS AND HUMAN WELFARE

 

 Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms



 

 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource



The absolute dependence of humans on Earth's flora is a specific and highly refined case of the more general connection between animals and plants. Of course, we humans, like most of Earth's species, depend on photosynthetic organisms for their ecological "services" of food production and oxygen release. What is special about our relationship with plants is our development of technology to maximize the harvest of plant products for human use. The lumber industry is an example. But the most important example is agriculture.
