-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Buffeted by storms , Russian rescuers repeatedly tried Tuesday to lower an escape capsule to 116 sailors trapped in a crippled nuclear submarine sitting on the floor of the Barents Sea .
Two U.S. government officials said Tuesday in Washington that a Navy submarine in the area detected the sound of an explosion and it was the `` working assumption '' that the noise was related to the sinking of the submarine Kursk .
The officials , who spoke to The Associated Press on condition they not be named , said the sound was not a missile being fired .
Russian Navy Chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov said earlier Tuesday that there appeared to have been an explosion in the torpedo compartment in the nose of the submarine , sending it crashing to the sea bottom .
He said earlier that the Kursk had likely collided with something and it was n't clear why he had changed his assessment .
Efforts to rescue the Kursk were hampered most of Tuesday by high winds and strong currents .
There had been no communication with the submarine since it went down , and conditions inside were not known .
It was n't clear how much air the crew had left and water appeared to be leaking in , officials said .
Seizing on a break in the weather late Tuesday , rescue ships resumed efforts to lower the escape capsule , but rough weather was frustrating the operation .
The situation , Kuroyedov said , was `` extremely grave . ''
The rescue operation faced severe difficulties .
The bell-shaped capsule was to try to latch on to a cargo hatch on the submarine , a precision maneuver made even more challenging because the Kursk was reportedly leaning at a sharp angle .
Even if the capsule successfully docks with the sub and sailors can enter it , the capsule can hold only 20 people at a time and officials say bringing it to the surface could take up to seven hours .
The slow rise is necessary to prevent decompression sickness -- the potentially crippling or fatal condition known as `` the bends . ''
It would be a laborious and nerve-fraying process under the best of circumstances , and weather forecasts indicated conditions in the disaster area would be rough for several days .
Russia refused offers from the United States and Britain to send trained rescue personnel and equipment even though the Russian navy lacks sophisticated rescue gear .
Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said coordinating the rescue with other countries would take too much time and `` we cannot afford to waste it . ''
However , a group of Russian military officers went to NATO headquarters in Brussels , Belgium , on Tuesday night to see what kind of assistance the alliance could offer , a NATO source said on condition of anonymity .
The U.S. officials said Tuesday that the sound of the explosion was detected Saturday .
The Russian government has said the accident that brought down the Kursk happened Sunday during military exercises .
The discrepancy could not be explained .
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley declined to say what , if anything , U.S. vessels may have heard from their position `` a couple of hundred '' miles away from the place the sub went down .
An explosion inside the submarine 's torpedo chamber , which contains warheads , would probably have caused extensive casualties , analysts said .
Navy officials said casualties could not be `` ruled out , '' Interfax reported .
While immediate concerns focused on the crew , there was also worry over whether the accident would result in a leak of radioactive material .
The prospects of such a leak were difficult to assess because it is not known what befell the Kursk , one of the Russian navy 's most modern ships .
Russian officials said the Kursk 's two nuclear reactors had been switched off and it was not carrying nuclear weapons .
Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded , officials said .
Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed in case of flooding .
`` Something extraordinary beyond the imagination of an engineer '' had happened , the chief designer of the submarine , Igor Baranov told the ITAR - Tass news agency .
Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse games in the area and have scraped each other in the past .
The U.S. Navy said Monday it had a monitoring ship in the area , but Quigley said there was no evidence that any U.S. vessel was involved in the accident .
Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of accidents in recent decades .
The navy , like the rest of the Russian military , is desperately short of money and performs almost no maintenance on its ships .
