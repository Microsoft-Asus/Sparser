You also know that B cell activation is aided by IL-2 and other cytokines secreted from helper T cells activated by the same antigen. Stimulated by both antigen and cytokines, the B cell proliferates and differentiates into a clone of antibody-secreting plasma cells and a clone of memory B cells. Antigens that evoke this type of B cell response are known as <span class="Emphasis2">T-dependent antigens</span> because they can stimulate antibody production only with help from T<SUB>H</SUB> cells (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.13</span>).

Such antigens are called T-dependent antigens, and most protein antigens are of this type.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Other antigens, such as polysaccharides and proteins with many identical polypeptides, function as <span class="Emphasis2">T-independent antigens.</span> Such antigens include the polysaccharides of many bacterial capsules and the proteins that make up bacterial flagella. Apparently, the repeated subunits of these antigens bind simultaneously to a number of membrane antibodies on the B cell surface. This provides enough stimulus to the B cell to generate antibody-secreting plasma cells without the help of IL-2. The response to T-independent antigens is very important in defending against many bacteria; however, the response is generally weaker than the response to T-dependent antigens, and no memory cells are generated in T-independent responses.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Before we leave our discussion of B cell function, it is important to recall that B cells bear class II MHC molecules: They are antigen-presenting cells. When antigen first binds to membrane antibodies, the B cell takes in a few of the foreign molecules by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 8.19c</span>). In a process very similar to presentation by macrophages, the B cell presents antigen to a helper T cell. However, although a macrophage can engulf and present peptide fragments from a wide variety of antigens, a B cell internalizes and presents peptides of only the antigen to which it specifically binds. Therefore, immunologists think that macrophages are the main APCs in the primary response (when B cells specific for a particular antigen are rare), whereas B cells, specifically memory B cells, are more important as APCs in secondary responses.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">In any given humoral response, the processes just discussed stimulate a variety of different B cells, each giving rise to a clone of thousands of plasma cells. Each plasma cell is estimated to secrete about 2,000 antibody molecules per second over the cell's 4- to 5-day life span. Next we look more closely at antibodies and how they bind to and mediate the disposal of antigens.</p><p class="Header3">Antibody Structure and Function</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Antigens that elicit a humoral immune response are typically the protein and polysaccharide surface components of microbes, incompatible transplanted tissue, or incompatible transfused blood cells. In addition, for some of us, the proteins of foreign substances such as pollen or bee venom act as antigens that induce an allergic, or hypersensitive, humoral response (to be discussed later).</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Neither the membrane version of the antibody--that is, the B cell receptor for antigen--nor the secreted antibody actually binds an entire antigen molecule. Rather, an antibody interacts with a small, accessible portion of the antigen called an <span class="Emphasis2">epitope</span> or antigenic determinant (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.14</span>). A single antigen such as a bacterial surface protein usually has several effective epitopes, each capable of inducing the production of specific antibody. It is therefore easy to imagine the entire surface of a bacterium coated with many different kinds of antibodies, each specific for a particular epitope. It is estimated that a bacterium can be bound by 4 million antibody molecules!</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig43-14','../fig/big/fig43-14.jpg','fig43-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig43-14.jpg" alt="fig43-14" name="myfig43-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 43-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Epitopes (antigenic determinants).</span> Antibodies bind to epitopes on the surface of an antigen.

The simplest of these is <span class="Emphasis2">neutralization,</span> in which the antibody binds to and blocks the activity of the antigen. For example, antibodies neutralize a virus by attaching to the molecules that the virus must use to infect its host cell. Similarly, antibodies may bind to the surface of a pathogenic bacterium. These microbes, now coated by antibodies, are readily eliminated by phagocytosis.

Agglutination is possible because each antibody molecule has at least two antigen-binding sites. IgG, for example, can bind to identical epitopes on two bacterial cells or viral particles, linking them together. IgM can link together five or more viruses or bacteria (as shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.16</span>). These large complexes are readily phagocytosed by macrophages. A similar mechanism is precipitation, the cross-linking of soluble antigen molecules--molecules dissolved in body fluids--to form immobile precipitates that are disposed of by phagocytes.</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText">One of the most important antibody-mediated disposal mechanisms is <span class="Emphasis2">complement fixation,</span> the activation of the complement system by antigen-antibody complexes. Recall that complement consists of about 20 different serum proteins that, in the absence of infection, are inactive. In an infection, however, the first in the series of complement proteins is activated, triggering a cascade of activation steps, each component activating the next in the series. Completion of the complement cascade results in the lysis of many types of viruses and pathogenic cells. Lysis by complement can be achieved in two ways. The <span class="Emphasis1">classical pathway</span> (so called because it was discovered first) is triggered by antibodies bound to antigen and is therefore important in the humoral immune response. The <span class="Emphasis1">alternative pathway</span> is triggered by substances that are naturally present on many bacteria, yeast, viruses, and protozoan parasites; it does not involve antibodies and thus is an important nonspecific defense.</p><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText">The classical pathway can begin when IgM or IgG antibodies bind to a pathogen, such as a bacterial cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.17</span>). The first complement component links two bound antibodies and is thus activated, initiating the cascade. Ultimately, complement proteins generate a <span class="Emphasis2">membrane attack complex (MAC),</span> which forms a pore in the bacterial membrane 7-10 nm in diameter. Ions and water rush into the cell, causing it to swell and lyse.

By binding to basophils and mast cells, some trigger the release of histamine, the injury-signaling molecule that triggers dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels. Several active complement proteins also attract phagocytes to the site. In addition, one of the activated complement proteins can cause opsonization: Copies of this protein coat bacterial surfaces and, like antibodies, stimulate phagocytosis. In a final example of teamwork in the body's defense systems, antibodies, complement, and phagocytes function together in a phenomenon called <span class="Emphasis2">immune adherence.</span> Microbes coated with antibodies and complement proteins adhere to blood vessel walls, making the pathogens easier prey for phagocytic cells circulating in the blood.</p><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText">You have seen that antibodies contribute in several ways to phagocytosis by macrophages. Keep in mind that phagocytosis enables macrophages to act as APCs, stimulating helper T cells, which, in turn, stimulate the very B cells whose antibodies contribute to phagocytosis.
