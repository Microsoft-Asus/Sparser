A top official visiting the country 's Far East said Wednesday that Moscow had no intention of surrendering the disputed Kuril Islands to Japan .
`` Russia 's borders are invariable .
It 's inadmissible and unconstitutional to give away the islands , '' Nemtsov said at a meeting with regional officials on Sakhalin Island , according to the ITAR - Tass news agency .
Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty ending World War II hostilities because of a dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain that Soviet troops seized at the end of the war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Relations between the two nations have been warming in recent years and President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed to conclude the peace treaty by 2000 during their meeting in Russia last November .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">At a subsequent summit in Japan in April , they pledged to accelerate efforts to conclude the treaty .</ENAMEX>
However , neither side has publicly offered a major compromise .
