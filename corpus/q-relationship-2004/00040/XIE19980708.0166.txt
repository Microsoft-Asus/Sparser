CANBERRA , July 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Australia Wednesday condemned Japan 's experimental tuna fishing program , warning that Japan was breaching international law if it went ahead with the plan .
Under the plan announced by Japan earlier Wednesday , 65 Japanese vessels will catch up to 1,400 tons of southern bluefin tuna -LRB- SBT -RRB- between July 10 and August 31 in the Indian Ocean in a bid to increase its catch quota .
Australian Resources Minister Warwick Parer called in Japanese Ambassador Yukio Satoh Wednesday morning to condemn Japan 's decision to implement the program .
`` Japan 's decision to go ahead with the experimental fishing program is shortsighted , and will reduce the chance that the southern bluefin tuna stock will recover from its present depleted state , '' Parer said in a statement .
`` We are now considering the formal dispute resolution mechanisms that are available to press the matter , '' he said .
The Japanese plan came as the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna -LRB- CCSBT -RRB- has been deadlocked since a meeting earlier this year where Australia and New Zealand denied Japan 's request to conduct experimental fishing and to increase the overall catch quota by 3,000 tons from 11,750 tons .
Last year 's 11,750 ton quota , which had been kept intact for the past 10 years , allowed Japan to fish 6,065 tons of tuna , Australia 5,265 tons and New Zealand 420 tons .
Australia has already banned Japanese tuna boats from fishing in Australia 's Exclusive Economic Zone as well as from Australian ports except in emergencies .
`` Following the Japanese decision , Australia will continue the ban and review it on a month-to-month basis , '' Parer said .
Australia , Japan and New Zealand are the founding members of the CCSBT , an international organization which sets a total allowable catch and national allocations for member countries .
