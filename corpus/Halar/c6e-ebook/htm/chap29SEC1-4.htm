And recall that vascular plants are equipped with food-transporting phloem as well as water-conducting xylem tissue with lignified cells. Vascular plants also differ from bryophytes in having a dominant sporophyte generation and <span class="Emphasis2">branched sporophytes</span> that become independent of parental gametophytes. Pteridophytes are described as <span class="Emphasis2">seedless vascular plants</span> because, unlike gymnosperms and angiosperms, they do not produce seeds. The first vascular plants were seedless (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.1</span>).</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
