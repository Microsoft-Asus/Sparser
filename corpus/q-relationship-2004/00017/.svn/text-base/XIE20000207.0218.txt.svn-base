LOS ANGELS , February 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Business -to-business -LRB- B2B -RRB- commerce in the United States will hit 2.7 trillion U.S. dollars in 2004 , as an overwhelming majority of firms are expected to buy and sell on the Internet , according to a report released Monday .
U.S. research firm Forrester Research said in the report that more than 90 percent of firms it interviewed will be transacting on the Net in two years .
Forrester interviewed 80 purchasing and sales executives from Fortune 1,000 firms .
According to the report , U.S. B2B growth will also be accelerated by the rapid development of e-marketplaces -- new models for conducting e-commerce , including auctions , aggregators , big systems and exchanges .
By 2004 , Forrester expects these marketplaces to capture 53 percent of all online business trade .
Forrester 's business e-commerce forecast is based on a model of B2B trade in 13 hard-goods supply chains and draws upon data from the U.S. government , industry and interviews , and its own research .
The research firm defines B2B e-commerce as inter-company trade in which the final order is placed over the Internet .
`` U.S. businesses are universally preparing to buy and sell online , leveraging the Net to build deeper relationships with their business partners , '' said the report .
`` But the rampant growth of online trade through these one-to-one business connections will taper off after 2001 , as firms more actively participate in marketplaces to connect with a wide universe of buyers and sellers .
'' Over the next two years , according to the report , marketplaces will spring up within most industries , attacking outdated business practices and inefficient trading relationships .
Using the e-marketplace opportunity index -LRB- eMOI -RRB- the firm created to determine where Net marketplaces will thrive , Forrester predicts that e-marketplaces will ultimately account for between 45 percent and 74 percent of e-commerce in a supply chain .
The largest impact will be in the computing and electronics , shipping and warehousing , and utilities and industries where more than 70 percent of online trade will go through e-marketplaces , according to the report .
By contrast , heavy industry and aerospace and defense will find less than 50 percent of their e-commerce flowing through e-marketplaces .
As firms hook into e-marketplaces and adopt more dynamic trading practices , existing business practices and supply chain relationships will get pulled apart , the report said .
According to an earlier study by Boston Consulting Group , also a research firm , one-fourth of all U.S. B2B purchasing will be done online by the year 2003 .
Between 1998 and 2003 , U.S. B2B commerce will grow by 33 percent each year and reach 2.8 trillion dollars in transaction value .
