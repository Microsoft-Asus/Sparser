The many aspects of animal form and function we have studied so far can be viewed, in the broadest context, as adaptations contributing to reproductive success. Individuals are transient. A population transcends finite life spans only by reproduction, the creation of new individuals from existing ones. The two earthworms in the photograph above are mating. Unless disturbed, they will remain above the ground and joined like this for several hours. Each worm produces both sperm and eggs, each donates and receives sperm during mating, and each will produce fertilized eggs. In a few weeks, sexual reproduction will be completed when many new individuals hatch from the eggs.

Animal reproduction is the subject of this chapter. We will first compare the diverse reproductive mechanisms that have evolved in the animal kingdom, and then examine the details of mammalian, particularly human, reproduction.

The mechanisms of fertilization, the union of sperm and egg, play an important part in sexual reproduction. Some species have external fertilization; eggs are shed by the female and fertilized by the male in the environment (FIGURE 46.4). Other species have internal fertilization; sperm are deposited in or near the female reproductive tract, and fertilization occurs within the tract. (The cellular and molecular details of fertilization are discussed in Chapter 47.)

Fig 46-4. The release of eggs and external fertilization. Many amphibians shed gametes into the environment, and fertilization occurs outside the female's body. In most species, behavioral adaptations ensure that a male is present when the female releases eggs. Here, a female frog, clasped by a male (on top), has just released a mass of eggs. The male released sperm (not shown) at the same time, and external fertilization has already occurred in the surrounding water.

 Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur in the animal kingdom

There are two principal modes of animal reproduction. Asexual (from the Greek, "without sex") reproduction is the creation of new individuals whose genes all come from one parent without the fusion of egg and sperm. In most cases, asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is the creation of offspring by the fusion of haploid gametes to form a zygote (fertilized egg), which is diploid. Gametes are formed by meiosis (see FIGURE 13.7). The female gamete, the ovum (unfertilized egg), is usually a relatively large and nonmotile cell. The male gamete, the spermatozoon, is generally a small, motile cell. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variability among offspring by generating unique combinations of genes inherited from two parents. By producing offspring having various phenotypes, sexual reproduction may enhance the reproductive success of parents when pathogens or other environmental factors change relatively rapidly.





 Diverse mechanisms of asexual reproduction enable animals to produce identical offspring rapidly

Many invertebrates can reproduce asexually by fission, the separation of a parent into two or more individuals of approximately equal size (FIGURE 46.1). Also common among invertebrates, budding involves new individuals splitting off from existing ones. For example, in certain cnidarians and tunicates, new individuals grow out from the body of a parent (see FIGURE 13.1). The offspring may either detach from the parent or remain joined, eventually forming extensive colonies. Stony corals, which may be more than 1 m across, are cnidarian colonies of several thousand connected individuals. In another form of asexual reproduction, some invertebrates release specialized groups of cells that can grow into new individuals. For example, the gemmules of sponges are formed when cells of several types migrate together within the sponge and become surrounded by a protective coat.

Fig 46-1. Two from one: asexual reproduction of a sea anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima). The individual in the center of this photograph is undergoing fission, a type of asexual reproduction. Two smaller individuals will soon form as the parent divides approximately in half. The offspring will be genetic copies of the parent.

Yet another type of asexual reproduction is fragmentation, the breaking of the body into several pieces, some or all of which develop into complete adults. For an animal to reproduce this way, fragmentation must be accompanied by regeneration, the regrowth of lost body parts. Reproduction by fragmentation and regeneration occurs in many sponges, cnidarians, polychaete annelids, and tunicates. Many animals can also replace lost appendages by regeneration--most sea stars can grow new arms when injured, for example--but this is not reproduction because new individuals are not created. In sea stars of the genus Linckia, a whole new individual may develop from an isolated arm. Thus, a single animal with five arms, if broken apart, could asexually give rise to five offspring.

Asexual reproduction has several potential advantages. For instance, it enables animals living in isolation to produce offspring without locating mates. It can also create numerous offspring in a short amount of time, which is ideal for colonizing a habitat rapidly. Theoretically, asexual reproduction is most advantageous in stable, favorable environments because it perpetuates successful genotypes precisely.





 Reproductive cycles and patterns vary extensively among animals

Most animals show definite cycles in reproductive activity, often related to changing seasons. The periodic nature of reproduction allows animals to conserve resources and reproduce when more energy is available than is needed for maintenance and when environmental conditions favor the survival of offspring. Ewes (female sheep), for example, have 15-day reproductive cycles and ovulate at the midpoint of each cycle. These cycles generally occur during fall and early winter, so lambs are usually born in the late winter or spring. Even animals that live in apparently stable habitats, such as the tropics or the ocean, generally reproduce only at certain times of the year. Reproductive cycles are controlled by a combination of hormonal and environmental cues, the latter including such factors as seasonal temperature, rainfall, day length, and lunar cycles (see the discussion of the pineal gland in Chapter 45).

Animals may reproduce asexually or sexually exclusively, or they may alternate between the two modes. In aphids, rotifers, and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia, each female can produce eggs of two types, depending on environmental conditions such as the time of year. One type of egg is fertilized, but the other type develops by parthenogenesis, a process in which the egg develops without being fertilized. The adults produced by parthenogenesis are often haploid, and eggs are formed without meiosis. In the case of Daphnia, the switch from sexual to asexual reproduction is often related to season. Asexual reproduction occurs under favorable conditions and sexual reproduction during times of environmental stress.

Parthenogenesis has a role in the social organization of certain species of bees, wasps, and ants. Male honeybees, or drones, are produced parthenogenetically, whereas females, both sterile workers and reproductive females (queens), develop from fertilized eggs.

Among vertebrates, several genera of fishes, amphibians, and lizards reproduce exclusively by a complex form of parthenogenesis that involves the doubling of chromosomes after meiosis to create diploid "zygotes." For example, there are about 15 species of whiptail lizards (genus Cnemidophorus) that reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. There are no males in these species, but the lizards imitate courtship and mating behavior typical of sexual species of the same genus. During the breeding season, one female of each mating pair mimics a male (FIGURE 46.2a). The roles change two or three times during the season, female behavior occurring when the level of the female sex hormone estrogen is high prior to ovulation (the release of eggs), and male behavior occurring after ovulation when the level of estrogen drops (FIGURE 46.2b). In fact, ovulation is more likely to occur if one individual is mounted by another during the critical time of the hormone cycle; isolated lizards lay fewer eggs than those that go through the motions of sex. Apparently, these parthenogenetic lizards, which evolved from species having two sexes, still require certain sexual stimuli for maximum reproductive success.

Fig 46-2. Sexual behavior in parthenogenetic lizards. The desert-grassland whiptail lizard (Cnemidophorus uniparens) is an all-female species. These reptiles reproduce by parthenogenesis; eggs undergo a chromosome doubling after meiosis and develop into lizards without being fertilized. However, ovulation is enhanced by courtship and mating rituals that imitate the behavior of closely related species that reproduce sexually.

Sexual reproduction presents a special problem for sessile or burrowing animals or for parasites, such as tapeworms, which may have difficulty encountering a member of the opposite sex. One solution to this problem is hermaphroditism, in which each individual has both male and female reproductive systems (the term is derived from Hermes and Aphrodite, names of a Greek god and goddess). Although some hermaphrodites fertilize themselves, most must mate with another member of the same species. When this occurs, each animal serves as both male and female, donating and receiving sperm, as we saw for earthworms. Each individual encountered is a potential mate, resulting in twice as many offspring than if only one individual's eggs were fertilized.

Another remarkable reproductive pattern is sequential hermaphroditism, in which an individual reverses its sex during its lifetime. In some species, the sequential hermaphrodite is protogynous (female first), while other species are protandrous (male first). In various species of reef fishes called wrasses, sex reversal is associated with age and size. For example, the Caribbean bluehead wrasse is a protogynous species in which only the largest (usually the oldest) individuals change from female to male (FIGURE 46.3). These fish live in harems consisting of a single male and several females. If the male dies or is removed in experiments, the largest female in the harem changes sex and becomes the new male. Within a week, the transformed individual is producing sperm instead of eggs. In this species, the male defends the harem against intruders, and thus larger size may give a greater reproductive advantage to males than it does to females. In contrast, there are protandrous animals that change from male to female when size increases. In such cases, greater size may increase the reproductive success of females more than it does males. For example, the production of huge numbers of gametes is an important asset for sedentary animals, such as oysters, that release their gametes into the surrounding water. Egg cells are generally much larger than sperm cells, so females produce fewer gametes than males. Larger females tend to produce more eggs than smaller ones, and species of oysters that are sequential hermaphrodites are generally protandrous.

Fig 46-3. Sex reversal in a sequential hermaphrodite. In many species of reef fishes called wrasses, sex can change during the animal's life. Sex reversal is often correlated with size. In this scene, a male Caribbean bluehead wrasse and two smaller females are feeding on a sea urchin. All wrasses of this species are born females, but the oldest, largest individuals change sex and complete their lives as males.

The diverse reproductive cycles and patterns we observe in the animal kingdom are adaptations that have evolved by natural selection. We will see many other examples as we survey the various mechanisms of sexual reproduction.





 Internal and external fertilization both depend on mechanisms ensuring that mature sperm encounter fertile eggs of the same species

Internal fertilization requires cooperative behavior, leading to copulation. In some cases, uncharacteristic sexual behavior is eliminated by natural selection in a direct manner; for example, female spiders will eat males if specific reproductive signals are not followed during mating. (We will discuss other examples of mating behavior in Chapter 51.) Internal fertilization also requires sophisticated reproductive systems, including copulatory organs that deliver sperm and receptacles for its storage and transport to ripe eggs.

Because external fertilization requires an environment where an egg can develop without desiccation or heat stress, it occurs almost exclusively in moist habitats. Many aquatic invertebrates simply shed their eggs and sperm into the surroundings, and fertilization occurs without the parents actually making physical contact. Timing is still crucial to ensure that mature sperm encounter ripe eggs.

Many fishes and amphibians that use external fertilization exhibit specific mating behaviors, in which one male fertilizes the eggs of one female. Courtship behavior is a mutual trigger for the release of gametes, with two effects: The probability of successful fertilization is increased, and the choice of mates may be somewhat selective. Environmental cues such as temperature or day length may cause all the individuals of a population to release gametes at once, or chemical signals from one individual releasing gametes may trigger gamete release in others.

Pheromones are chemical signals released by one organism that influence the behavior of other individuals of the same species. Pheromones are small, volatile or water-soluble molecules that disperse easily into the environment and, like hormones, are active in minute amounts. Many pheromones function as mate attractants. The mate attractants of some female insects can be detected by males as much as a mile away. The pheromone of the female gypsy moth elicits behavioral responses in males at concentrations as low as 1 molecule of pheromone in 1017 molecules of other gases in the air. (We will return to pheromones in Chapter 51.)





 Species with internal fertilization usually produce fewer zygotes but provide more parental protection than species with external fertilization

All species produce more offspring than survive to reproduce. Species with external fertilization usually produce enormous numbers of zygotes, but the proportion that survive and develop further is often quite small. Internal fertilization usually produces fewer zygotes, but this may be offset by greater protection of the embryos and parental care of the young. Major types of protection include resistant eggshells, development of the embryo within the reproductive tract of the female parent, and parental care of the eggs and offspring.

Many species of terrestrial animals produce eggs that can withstand harsh environments. Birds, reptiles, and monotremes have amniote eggs with calcium and protein shells that resist water loss and physical damage. By contrast, the eggs of fishes and amphibians have only a gelatinous coat.

Rather than secreting a protective shell around the egg, many animals retain the embryo, which develops within the female reproductive tract. Among mammals, marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums retain their embryos for a short period in the uterus; the embryos then crawl out and complete fetal development attached to a mammary gland in the mother's pouch. The embryos of eutherian (placental) mammals develop entirely within the uterus, being nourished by the mother's blood supply through a special organ, the placenta (discussed in Chapter 34 and later in this chapter).

When a kangaroo crawls out of its mother's pouch for the first time, or when a human is born, it still is not capable of independent existence. We are familiar with adult birds feeding their young and mammals nursing their offspring, but parental care is much more widespread than we might suspect, and it takes a variety of unusual forms. In one species of tropical frog, for instance, the male carries the tadpoles in his stomach until they metamorphose and hop out as young frogs. There are also many cases of parental care among invertebrates (FIGURE 46.5).

Fig 46-5. Parental care in an invertebrate. Compared to many insects, giant water bugs (Belostoma) produce relatively few offspring, but parental protection enhances the survival of those offspring. Fertilization is internal, and the female glues her fertilized eggs to the back of the male (shown here). Whereas the males of most insect species provide no parental care for their offspring, the male giant water bug carries them for days, frequently fanning water over them. This treatment helps keep the eggs moist, aerated, and free of parasites.





 Complex reproductive systems have evolved in many animal phyla

To reproduce sexually, animals must have systems that produce gametes and deliver them to the gametes of the opposite sex. These reproductive systems are varied. The least complex systems do not even contain distinct gonads, the organs that produce gametes in most animals. The most complex reproductive systems contain many sets of accessory tubes and glands that carry and protect the gametes and developing embryos. Many animals whose body plans are otherwise relatively simple possess highly complex reproductive systems. The reproductive systems of parasitic flatworms, for example, are among the most complex in the animal kingdom (FIGURE 46.6).

Fig 46-6. Reproductive anatomy of a parasitic flatworm. Most flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are hermaphroditic, with complex male and female reproductive systems. Both systems open to the outside through the genital pore. Sperm produced in the testes pass through a pair of ducts (vasa efferentia) into a single sperm duct (vas deferens) and are stored in the seminal vesicle. During copulation, sperm are ejaculated into the female system (usually of another individual) and then move through the uterus to the seminal receptacle. (In some flatworms, sperm are injected into the body tissues through the body wall and then migrate to the female reproductive tract.) Eggs from the ovary pass into the oviduct, where they are fertilized by sperm from the seminal receptacle and coated with yolk and tough shell material secreted by the yolk glands. From the oviduct, the fertilized, shelled eggs pass into the uterus from which they are shed through the genital pore. Usually only a small fraction of the eggs will develop into the next generation of adult worms.

Among the least complex systems are those of polychaete worms (phylum Annelida). Most polychaetes have separate sexes but do not have distinct gonads; rather, the eggs and sperm develop from undifferentiated cells lining the coelom. As the gametes mature, they are released from the body wall and fill the coelom. Depending on the species, mature gametes may be shed through the excretory openings, or the swelling mass of eggs may split the body open, killing the parent and spilling the eggs into the environment.

Most insects have separate sexes with complex reproductive systems (FIGURE 46.7). In the male, sperm develop in a pair of testes and are conveyed along a coiled duct to two seminal vesicles, where they are stored. During mating, sperm are ejaculated into the female reproductive system. In the female, eggs develop in a pair of ovaries and are conveyed through ducts to the vagina, where fertilization occurs. In many species the female reproductive system includes a spermatheca, a sac in which sperm may be stored for a year or more.

Fig 46-7. Insect reproductive anatomy.

The basic plan of all vertebrate reproductive systems is quite similar, but there are some important variations. In many nonmammalian vertebrates, the digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems have a common opening to the outside, the cloaca, which was probably present in the ancestors of all vertebrates. By contrast, most mammals lack a cloaca and have a separate opening for the digestive tract, and most female mammals have separate openings for the excretory and reproductive systems as well. The uterus of most vertebrates is partly or completely divided into two chambers. However, in humans and other mammals that produce only a few young at a time, as well as in birds and many snakes, the uterus is a single structure. Male reproductive systems differ mainly in the copulatory organs. Many nonmammalian vertebrates do not have a well-developed penis and simply evert the cloaca to ejaculate.





 Human reproduction involves intricate anatomy and complex behavior

Reproductive Anatomy of the Human Male

In most mammalian species, including humans, the male's external reproductive organs are the scrotum and penis. The internal reproductive organs consist of gonads that produce gametes (sperm cells) and hormones, accessory glands that secrete products essential to sperm movement, and ducts that carry the sperm and glandular secretions (FIGURE 46.8).

Fig 46-8. Reproductive anatomy of the human male.

The male gonads, or testes (singular, testis), consist of many highly coiled tubes surrounded by several layers of connective tissue. These tubes are the seminiferous tubules, where sperm form. The Leydig cells scattered between the seminiferous tubules produce testosterone and other androgens.

Production of normal sperm cannot occur at the body temperatures of most mammals, and the testes of humans and many other mammals are held outside the abdominal cavity in the scrotum, which is a fold of the body wall. The temperature in a scrotum is about 2&#176;C below that in the abdominal cavity. The testes develop high in the abdominal cavity and descend into the scrotum just before birth. In many rodents, the testes are drawn back into the abdominal cavity, and sperm maturation is interrupted between breeding seasons. Some mammals whose body temperature is low enough to allow sperm maturation, such as monotremes, whales, and elephants, retain the testes within the abdominal cavity permanently.

From the seminiferous tubules of a testis, the sperm pass into the coiled tubules of the epididymis. It takes about 20 days for sperm to pass through the 6-m-long tubules of each epididymis of a human male. During this passage, the sperm become motile and gain the ability to fertilize. During ejaculation, the sperm are propelled from the epididymis through the muscular vas deferens. These two ducts (one from each epididymis) run from the scrotum around and behind the urinary bladder, where each joins a duct from the seminal vesicle, forming a short ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts open into the urethra, the tube that drains both the excretory system and the reproductive system. The urethra runs through the penis and opens to the outside at the tip of the penis.

Three sets of accessory glands (the seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands) add secretions to the semen, the fluid that is ejaculated. A pair of seminal vesicles contributes about 60%  of the total volume of the semen. The fluid from the seminal vesicles is thick, yellowish, and alkaline. It contains mucus, the sugar fructose (which provides most of the energy used by the sperm), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid, and prostaglandins, local regulators discussed in Chapter 45.

The prostate gland is the largest of the semen-secreting glands. It secretes its products directly into the urethra through several small ducts. Prostatic fluid is thin and milky, contains anticoagulant enzymes and citrate (a sperm nutrient). The prostate gland is the source of some of the most common medical problems of men over age 40. Benign (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate occurs in more than half of all men in this age group and in virtually all men over 70. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. It is treated surgically or with drugs that inhibit gonadotropins, resulting in reduced prostate activity and size.

The bulbourethral glands are a pair of small glands along the urethra below the prostate. Before ejaculation they secrete a clear mucus that neutralizes any acidic urine remaining in the urethra. Bulbourethral fluid also carries some sperm released before ejaculation, which is one reason for the high failure rate of the withdrawal method of birth control.

A man usually ejaculates about 2 to 5 mL of semen, and each milliliter may contain about 50 to 130 million sperm. Once in the female reproductive tract, prostaglandins in the semen thin the mucus at the opening of the uterus and stimulate contractions of the uterine muscles, which help move the semen up the uterus. The semen is slightly alkaline, and this helps neutralize the acidic environment of the vagina, protecting the sperm and increasing their motility. When first ejaculated, the semen coagulates, making it easier for uterine contractions to move it along; then anticoagulants liquify the semen, and the sperm begin swimming through the female tract.

The human penis is composed of three cylinders of spongy erectile tissue derived from modified veins and capillaries. During sexual arousal, the erectile tissue fills with blood from the arteries. As this tissue fills, the increasing pressure seals off the veins that drain the penis, causing it to engorge with blood. The resulting erection is essential to insertion of the penis into the vagina. Rodents, raccoons, walruses, and several other mammals also possess a baculum, a bone that is contained in, and helps stiffen, the penis. Temporary impotence, a reversible inability to achieve an erection, can result from alcohol consumption, certain drugs, and emotional problems. Several drugs and penile implant devices are available for men with nonreversible impotence due to nervous system or circulatory problems. A new oral drug called Viagra&#174; promotes the action of the local regulator nitric oxide (NO), enhancing relaxation of smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis. This allows blood to enter the erectile tissue and sustain an erection.

The main shaft of the penis is covered by relatively thick skin. The head, or glans penis, has a much thinner covering and is consequently more sensitive to stimulation. The human glans is covered by a fold of skin called the foreskin, or prepuce, which may be removed by circumcision. Circumcision, which arose from religious traditions, has no verifiable basis in health or hygiene.

Reproductive Anatomy of the Human Female

The female's external reproductive structures are the clitoris and two sets of labia surrounding the clitoris and vaginal opening. The internal reproductive organs consist of a pair of gonads and a system of ducts and chambers to conduct the gametes and house the embryo and fetus (FIGURE 46.9).

Fig 46-9. Reproductive anatomy of the human female.

The female gonads, the ovaries, lie in the abdominal cavity, flanking, and attached by a mesentery to, the uterus. Each ovary is enclosed in a tough protective capsule and contains many follicles. A follicle consists of one egg cell surrounded by one or more layers of follicle cells, which nourish and protect the developing egg cell. All of the 400,000 follicles a woman will ever have are formed before her birth. Of these, only several hundred will release egg cells during the woman's reproductive years. Starting at puberty and continuing until menopause, usually one follicle matures and releases its egg cell during each menstrual cycle. The cells of the follicle also produce the primary female sex hormones, the estrogens. The egg cell is expelled from the follicle in the process of ovulation (FIGURE 46.10). The remaining follicular tissue then grows within the ovary to form a solid mass called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes additional estrogens and progesterone, the hormone that maintains the uterine lining during pregnancy. If the egg cell is not fertilized, the corpus luteum disintegrates, and a new follicle matures during the next cycle.

Fig 46-10. Ovulation. An egg cell is released from a follicle at the surface of the ovary. The orangish mass below the ejected egg cell is part of a mammalian ovary.

The female reproductive system is not completely closed, and the egg cell is released into the abdominal cavity near the opening of the oviduct, or fallopian tube. The oviduct has a funnel-like opening, and cilia on the inner epithelium lining the duct help collect the egg cell by drawing fluid from the body cavity into the duct. The cilia also convey the egg cell down the duct to the uterus, also known as the womb. The uterus is a thick, muscular organ that can expand during pregnancy to accommodate a 4-kg fetus. The inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is richly supplied with blood vessels.

The neck of the uterus is the cervix, which opens into the vagina. The vagina is a thin-walled chamber that forms the birth canal through which the baby is born; it is also the repository for sperm during copulation.

At birth, and usually until sexual intercourse or vigorous physical activity ruptures it, a vascularized membrane called the hymen partly covers the vaginal opening in humans. The vaginal opening and the separate urethral opening are located within a region called the vestibule, bordered by a pair of slender skin folds, the labia minora. A pair of thick, fatty ridges, the labia majora, encloses and protects the labia minora and vestibule. At the front edge of the vestibule, the clitoris consists of a short shaft supporting a rounded glans, or head, covered by a small hood of skin, the prepuce. During sexual arousal, the clitoris, vagina, and labia minora all engorge with blood and enlarge. The clitoris consists largely of erectile tissue. Richly supplied with nerve endings, it is one of the most sensitive points of sexual stimulation. During sexual arousal, Bartholin's glands, located near the vaginal opening, secrete mucus into the vestibule, keeping it lubricated and facilitating intercourse.

Mammary glands are present in both sexes but normally function only in women. They are not part of the reproductive system but are important to mammalian reproduction. Within the glands, small sacs of epithelial tissue secrete milk, which drains into a series of ducts opening at the nipple. Fatty (adipose) tissue forms the main mass of the mammary gland of a nonlactating mammal. The low level of estrogen in males prevents the development of both the secretory apparatus and the fat deposits, so male breasts remain small, and the nipples are not connected to the ducts.

Human Sexual Response

Many vertebrates and invertebrates have elaborate and complex mating behavior (see Chapter 51). Human sexuality is characterized by a diversity of stimuli and responses, with a common, underlying physiological pattern.

Two types of physiological reactions predominate in both sexes: vasocongestion, the filling of a tissue with blood caused by increased blood flow through the arteries of that tissue, and myotonia, increased muscle tension. Both skeletal and smooth muscle may show sustained or rhythmic contractions, including those associated with orgasm.

The sexual response cycle can be divided into four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. An important function of the excitement phase is preparation of the vagina and penis for coitus (sexual intercourse). During this phase, vasocongestion is particularly evident in erection of the penis and clitoris; enlargement of the testes, labia, and breasts; and vaginal lubrication. Myotonia may occur, resulting in nipple erection or tension of the arms and legs.

The plateau phase continues these responses. In females, the outer third of the vagina becomes vasocongested, while the inner two-thirds becomes slightly expanded. This change, coupled with the elevation of the uterus, forms a depression that receives sperm at the back of the vagina. Breathing increases and heart rate rises, sometimes to 150 beats per minute--not in response to the physical effort of sexual activity, but as an involuntary response to stimulation of the autonomic nervous system (see FIGURES 48.17 and FIGURES 48.18).

Orgasm is characterized by rhythmic, involuntary contractions of the reproductive structures in both sexes. Male orgasm has two stages. Emission is the contraction of the glands and ducts of the reproductive tract, which forces semen into the urethra. Expulsion, or ejaculation, occurs when the urethra contracts and the semen is expelled. During female orgasm, the uterus and outer vagina contract, but the inner two-thirds of the vagina do not. Orgasm is the shortest phase of the sexual response cycle, usually lasting only a few seconds. In members of both sexes, contractions occur at about 0.8-sec intervals and may involve the anal sphincter and several abdominal muscles.

The resolution phase completes the cycle and reverses the responses of the earlier stages. Vasocongested organs return to their normal size and color, and muscles relax. Most of the changes during resolution are completed in 5 minutes. Loss of penile and clitoral erection, however, may take longer. An initial loss of erection is rapid in both sexes, but a return of the organs to their nonaroused size may take as long as an hour.





 Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve meiosis but differ in three significant ways

Spermatogenesis, the production of mature sperm cells, is a continuous and prolific process in the adult male. Each ejaculation of a human male contains 100 to 650 million sperm cells, and males can ejaculate daily with little loss of fertilizing capacity.

Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. FIGURE 46.11 describes the process in some detail. The stem cells that give rise to sperm, spermatogonia, are located at the periphery of each seminiferous tubule. The developing sperm cells move toward the central opening (lumen) of the tubule as they undergo meiosis and differentiation. The four cells that results from meiosis all develop into mature sperm cells.

Fig 46-11. Spermatogenesis. These drawings correlate the meiotic stages in sperm development (left) with the structure of seminiferous tubules at the microscopic level. Primordial germ cells of the embryonic testes differentiate into spermatogonia, the stem cells that give rise to sperm. As spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes and then to spermatids, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from diploid (2n = 46 in humans) to haploid (n = 23). The developing cells are gradually pushed from a location near the outer wall of the seminiferous tubule toward the lumen (central opening) and make their way to the epididymis, where they become motile. This process, from spermatogonia to motile sperm, takes 65 to 75 days in the human male. In mature males, about 3 million spermatogonia start the process each day.

The structure of a sperm cell fits its function (FIGURE 46.12). In most species, a head containing the haploid nucleus is tipped with a special body, the acrosome, which contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg. Behind the head, the sperm cell contains large numbers of mitochondria (or a single large one, in some species) that provide ATP for movement of the tail, which is a flagellum. Mammalian sperm shape varies from species to species, with the head a slender comma shape, an oval form (as in the human sperm), or nearly spherical.

Fig 46-12. Structure of a human sperm cell.

Oogenesis is the development of ova--mature, unfertilized egg cells. FIGURE 46.13, p. 986, shows the process and its location, the ovary. In the developing female embryo, oogonia, the stem cells that give rise to ova, multiply and then begin meiosis, but the process stops at prophase I. The cells at this stage, called primary oocytes, remain quiescent within small follicles until puberty, when they are reactivated by hormones. Beginning at puberty, FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) periodically stimulates a follicle to grow and induces its primary oocyte to complete meiosis I and start meiosis II. Meiosis then stops again; the secondary oocyte, released during ovulation, does not continue meiosis II right away. In humans, penetration of the egg cell by the sperm triggers the completion of meiosis, and only then is oogenesis actually complete.

Fig 46-13. Oogenesis.

Oogenesis differs from spermatogenesis in three major ways. First, during the meiotic divisions of oogenesis, cytokinesis is unequal, with almost all the cytoplasm monopolized by a single daughter cell, the secondary oocyte. This large cell can go on to form the ovum; the other products of meiosis, smaller cells called polar bodies, degenerate. This contrasts with spermatogenesis, when all four products of meiosis develop into mature sperm (compare FIGURES 46.11 and FIGURES 46.13). Second, while the cells from which sperm develop continue to divide by mitosis throughout the male's life, this is not the case for oogenesis in the female. At birth, an ovary already contains all the primary oocytes it will ever have. Third, oogenesis has long "resting" periods, in contrast to spermatogenesis, which produces mature sperm from precursor cells in an uninterrupted sequence.





 A complex interplay of hormones regulates reproduction

The Male Pattern

In the male, the principal sex hormones are the androgens, of which testosterone is the most important. Androgens, steroid hormones produced mainly by the Leydig cells of the testes, are directly responsible for the primary and secondary sex characteristics of the male. Primary sex characteristics are those associated with the reproductive system: development of the vasa deferentia and other ducts, development of the external reproductive structures, and sperm production. Secondary sex characteristics are features that are not directly related to the reproductive system, including deepening of the voice, distribution of facial and pubic hair, and muscle growth (androgens stimulate protein synthesis). Androgens are also potent determinants of behavior in mammals and other vertebrates. In addition to specific sexual behaviors and sex drive, androgens increase general aggressiveness and are responsible for such actions as singing in birds and calling by frogs. Hormones from the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus control both androgen secretion and sperm production by the testes (FIGURE 46.14).

Fig 46-14. Hormonal control of the testes. The anterior pituitary secretes two gonadotropic hormones with different effects on the testes, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH are themselves both regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. LH, FSH, and GnRH concentrations in the blood are regulated by negative feedback by androgens. GnRH is also controlled by negative feedback from LH and FSH (not shown). In human males, these feedback loops keep the hormones at relatively constant levels, but in many other mammalian species, seasonal cycles in hormone concentration regulate breeding patterns.

The Female Pattern

In the female, the pattern of hormone secretion and the reproductive events the hormones regulate are cyclic, very different from the male pattern. Whereas males produce sperm continuously, females release only one egg or a few eggs at one time during each cycle. Control of the female cycle is quite complex.

Two different types of cycles occur in female mammals. Humans and many other primates have menstrual cycles, whereas other mammals have estrous cycles. In both cases, ovulation occurs at a time in the cycle after the endometrium has started to thicken and develop a rich blood supply, which prepares the uterus for the possible implantation of an embryo. One difference between the two types of cycles involves the fate of the uterine lining if pregnancy does not occur. In menstrual cycles, the endometrium is shed from the uterus through the cervix and vagina in a bleeding called menstruation. In estrous cycles, the endometrium is reabsorbed by the uterus, and no extensive bleeding occurs.

Other major distinctions include more pronounced behavioral changes during estrous cycles than during menstrual cycles and stronger effects of season and climate on estrous cycles. Whereas human females may be receptive to sexual activity throughout their cycles, most mammals will copulate only during the period surrounding ovulation. This period of sexual activity, called estrus (from the Latin oestrus, frenzy, passion), is the only time vaginal changes permit mating. Estrus is sometimes called heat, and indeed the female's body temperature increases slightly. The length and frequency of reproductive cycles vary widely among mammals. The human menstrual cycle averages 28 days (although cycles vary, ranging from about 20 to 40 days). In contrast, the estrous cycle of the rat is only 5 days. Bears and dogs have one cycle per year, but elephants cycle several times per year.

Let's examine the reproductive cycle of the human female in more detail as a case study of how a complex function is coordinated by hormones. The term menstrual cycle refers specifically to the changes that occur in the uterus (FIGURE 46.15, p. 988). By convention, the first day of a woman's menstrual period, the first day of menstruation, is designated day 1 of the cycle. The menstrual flow phase of the cycle, during which menstrual bleeding (loss of most of the functional layer of the endometrium) occurs, usually persists for a few days (FIGURE 46.15d). Then the thin remaining endometrium begins to regenerate and thicken for a week or two, during what is called the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. During the last phase, the secretory phase, usually about two weeks in duration, the endometrium continues to thicken, becomes more vascularized, and develops glands that secrete a fluid rich in glycogen. If an embryo has not implanted in the uterine lining by the end of the secretory phase, a new menstrual flow commences, marking day 1 of the next cycle.

Fig 46-15. The reproductive cycle of the human female. Hormones coordinate the ovarian and menstrual cycles, preparing the uterine lining (endometrium) for implantation of an embryo even before ovulation. (a) Changes in LH and FSH levels. (b) Changes in the levels of estrogens and progesterone. (c) The ovarian cycle consists of a follicular phase, during which follicles grow and secrete increasing amounts of estrogens; ovulation; and a luteal phase, during which the corpus luteum secretes estrogens and progesterone. Length of the follicular phase varies; the luteal phase usually lasts 13 to 15 days. (d) The menstrual cycle consists of a menstrual flow phase, a proliferative phase, and a secretory phase. Menstruation, the shedding of the endometrium, occurs during the menstrual flow phase. The first day of flow marks day 1 of the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, estrogens from the growing follicle stimulate the endometrium to thicken and become increasingly vascularized. During the secretory phase, the endometrium continues to thicken, its arteries enlarge, and endometrial glands grow. These endometrial changes require estrogens and progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation. Thus, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle parallels the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. Disintegration of the corpus luteum at the end of the luteal phase reduces the amount of estrogens and progesterone available to the endometrium, so it is shed. In the event of pregnancy, additional mechanisms maintain high levels of estrogens and progesterone, preventing loss of the endometrium.

Paralleling the menstrual cycle is an ovarian cycle (FIGURE 46.15c). It begins with the follicular phase, during which several follicles in the ovary begin to grow. The developing egg cell in each of these follicles enlarges, and its coat of follicle cells thickens. Of the several follicles that start to grow, however, only one usually continues to enlarge and mature while the others disintegrate. The maturing follicle develops an internal fluid-filled cavity and grows very large, forming a bulge near the surface of the ovary. The follicular phase ends with ovulation, when the follicle and adjacent wall of the ovary rupture, releasing the secondary oocyte. The follicular tissue that remains in the ovary after ovulation develops into the corpus luteum. Endocrine cells of the corpus luteum secrete female hormones during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. The next cycle begins with a new growth of follicles.

Hormones coordinate the menstrual and ovarian cycles in such a way that growth of the follicle and ovulation are synchronized with preparation of the uterine lining for possible implantation of an embryo. Five hormones participate in an elaborate scheme involving both positive and negative feedback. These hormones are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), secreted by the hypothalamus; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the two gonadotropins secreted by the anterior pituitary; and estrogens (a family of closely related hormones) and progesterone, the female sex hormones secreted by the ovaries. The relative levels of the pituitary and ovarian hormones in blood plasma are graphed in FIGURE 46.15a and b, and correlated with the phases of the ovarian and menstrual cycles. As you read the following discussion, refer to the figure as a guide to understanding how the hormones regulate the female reproductive system.

During the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, the pituitary secretes small amounts of FSH and LH in response to stimulation by GnRH from the hypothalamus. At this time, the cells of immature ovarian follicles have receptors for FSH but not for LH. The FSH stimulates follicle growth, and the cells of these growing follicles secrete estrogens. Notice in FIGURE 46.15b that there is a slow rise in the amount of estrogens secreted during most of the follicular phase. This small increase in estrogens inhibits secretion of the pituitary hormones, keeping the levels of FSH and LH relatively low during most of the follicular phase. These hormonal relationships change radically and rather abruptly when the rate of secretion of estrogens by the growing follicle begins to rise steeply. Whereas a slow rise of estrogens inhibits the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, a high concentration of estrogens has the opposite effect and stimulates the secretion of gonadotropins by acting on the hypothalamus to increase its output of GnRH. You can see this response in FIGURE 46.15a as a steep increase of FSH and LH levels that occurs soon after the increase in the concentration of estrogens. The effect is greater for LH because the high concentration of estrogens, in addition to stimulating GnRH secretion, also increases the sensitivity of LH-releasing mechanisms in the pituitary to the hypothalamic signal (GnRH). By now, the follicles have receptors for LH and can respond to this hormonal cue. In an example of positive feedback, the increase in LH concentration caused by increased secretion of estrogens from the growing follicle induces final maturation of the follicle, and ovulation occurs about a day after the LH surge.

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the transformation of the follicular tissue left behind in the ovary to form the corpus luteum, a glandular structure. (It is for this "luteinizing" function that LH is named.) Under continued stimulation by LH during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle, the corpus luteum secretes estrogens and a second steroid hormone, progesterone. The corpus luteum usually reaches its maximum development about 8 to 10 days after ovulation. As the levels of progesterone and estrogens rise, the combination of these hormones exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, inhibiting the secretion of LH and FSH. Near the end of the luteal phase, the corpus luteum disintegrates (possibly a result of prostaglandins secreted by its own cells). Consequently, concentrations of estrogens and progesterone decline sharply. The dropping levels of ovarian hormones liberate the hypothalamus and pituitary from the inhibitory effects of these hormones. The pituitary then begins to secrete enough FSH to stimulate the growth of new follicles in the ovary, initiating the follicular phase of the next ovarian cycle.

How is the ovarian cycle synchronized with the menstrual cycle? Estrogens, secreted in increasing amounts by growing follicles, are a hormonal signal to the uterus, causing the endometrium to thicken. Thus, the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Before ovulation, the uterus is already being prepared for a possible embryo. After ovulation, estrogens and progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum stimulate continued development and maintenance of the endometrium, including an enlargement of arteries supplying blood to the uterine lining and the growth of endometrial glands that secrete a nutrient fluid that can sustain an early embryo before it actually implants in the uterine lining. Thus, the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. The rapid drop in the level of ovarian hormones when the corpus luteum disintegrates causes spasms of arteries in the uterine lining that deprive the endometrium of blood. Disintegration of the endometrium results in menstruation and the beginning of a new menstrual cycle. In the meantime, ovarian follicles that will stimulate renewed thickening of the endometrium are just beginning to grow. Cycle after cycle, the maturation and release of egg cells from the ovary is integrated with changes in the uterus, the organ that must accommodate an embryo if the egg cell is fertilized. In the absence of pregnancy, a new cycle begins. We will soon see that there are "override" mechanisms that prevent disintegration of the endometrium in the event of pregnancy.

In addition to their role in coordinating reproductive cycles, estrogens are also responsible for the secondary sex characteristics of the female. The hormones induce deposition of fat in the breasts and hips, increase water retention, affect calcium metabolism, stimulate breast development, and mediate female sexual behavior.

Menopause. On average, human females undergo menopause, the cessation of ovulation and menstruation, between the ages of 46 and 54. Apparently, during these years the ovaries lose their responsiveness to gonadotropins (the hormones FSH and LH) from the pituitary, and menopause results from a decline in production of estrogens by the ovary. Menopause is an unusual phenomenon; in most species, females as well as males retain their reproductive capacity throughout life. Is there an evolutionary explanation for menopause? Why might natural selection have favored females who stopped reproducing? One intriguing (and highly controversial) hypothesis proposes that during early human evolution, undergoing menopause after having some children actually increased a woman's fitness; losing the ability to reproduce allowed her to provide better care for her children and grandchildren, thereby increasing the survival of individuals bearing her genes.





 Embryonic and fetal development occur during pregnancy in humans and other eutherian (placental) mammals

From Conception to Birth

In placental mammals, pregnancy, or gestation, is the condition of carrying one or more embryos, new developing individuals, in the uterus. Pregnancy is preceded by conception, the fertilization of the egg by a sperm cell, and continues until the birth of the offspring. Human pregnancy averages 266 days (38 weeks) from conception, or 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual cycle. Duration of pregnancy in other species correlates with body size and the extent of development of the young at birth. Many rodents (mice and rats) have gestation periods of about 21 days, whereas those of dogs are closer to 60 days. In cows, gestation averages 270 days (almost the same as humans); in giraffes, it is about 420 days; and in elephants, gestation is more than 600 days.

Human gestation can be divided for convenience of study into three trimesters of about 3 months each. The first trimester is the time of most radical change for both the mother and the baby. Fertilization occurs in the oviduct (FIGURE 46.16). About 24 hours later, the resulting zygote begins dividing, a process called cleavage. Cleavage continues, with the embryo becoming a ball of cells by the time it reaches the uterus about 3 to 4 days after fertilization. By about 1 week after fertilization, cleavage has produced an embryonic stage called the blastocyst, a sphere of cells containing a flattened cavity. In a process that takes about 5 more days, the blastocyst implants into the endometrium. Differentiation of body structures now begins in earnest. (Embryonic development will be described in detail in Chapter 47.) During implantation, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium, which responds by growing over the blastocyst. The embryo obtains nutrients directly from the endometrium during the first 2 to 4 weeks of development. Meanwhile, tissues grow out from the developing embryo and mingle with the endometrium to form the placenta. This disk-shaped organ, containing embryonic and maternal blood vessels, grows to about the size of a dinner plate and weighs somewhat less than 1 kg. Diffusion of material between maternal and embryonic circulations provides nutrients, exchanges respiratory gases, and disposes of metabolic wastes for the embryo. Blood from the embryo travels to the placenta through arteries of the umbilical cord and returns via the umbilical vein, passing through the liver of the embryo (FIGURE 46.17).

The first trimester is also the main period of organogenesis, the development of the body organs (FIGURE 46.18). The heart begins beating by the fourth week and can be detected with a stethoscope by the end of the first trimester. By the end of the eighth week, all the major structures of the adult are present in rudimentary form. At this point, the embryo is called a fetus. Although well differentiated, the fetus is only 5 cm long by the end of the first trimester. Because of its rapid organogenesis, the embryo is most sensitive during the first trimester to such threats as radiation and drugs that can cause birth defects.

Fig 46-18. Human fetal development. (a) 5 weeks. Limb buds, eyes, the heart, the liver, and rudiments of all other organs have started to develop in the embryo, which is only about 1 cm long. (b) 14 weeks. Growth and development of the offspring, now called a fetus, continue during the second trimester. This fetus is about 6 cm long. (c) 20 weeks. By the end of the second trimester (at 24 weeks), the fetus grows to about 30 cm in length.

The first trimester is also a time of rapid change for the mother. The embryo secretes hormones that signal its presence and control the mother's reproductive system. One embryonic hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), acts like pituitary LH to maintain secretion of progesterone and estrogens by the corpus luteum through the first trimester. In the absence of this hormonal override, the decline in maternal LH due to inhibition of the pituitary by progesterone would result in menstruation and spontaneous abortion of the embryo. Levels of HCG in the maternal blood are so high that some is excreted in the urine, where it can be detected in pregnancy tests. High levels of progesterone initiate changes in the pregnant woman's reproductive system, including increased mucus in the cervix that forms a protective plug, growth of the maternal part of the placenta, enlargement of the uterus, and (by negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary) cessation of ovulation and menstrual cycling. The breasts also enlarge rapidly and are often quite tender.

During the second trimester, the fetus grows rapidly to about 30 cm and is very active. The mother may feel movements during the early part of the second trimester, and fetal activity may be visible through the abdominal wall by the middle of this time period. Hormone levels stabilize as HCG declines, the corpus luteum deteriorates, and the placenta secretes its own progesterone, which maintains the pregnancy. During the second trimester, the uterus will grow enough for the pregnancy to become obvious.

The third and final trimester is one of rapid growth of the fetus to about 3-3.5 kg in weight and 50 cm in length. Fetal activity may decrease as the fetus fills the available space within the embryonic membranes. As the fetus grows and the uterus expands around it, the mother's abdominal organs become compressed and displaced, leading to frequent urination, digestive blockages, and strain in the back muscles. A complex interplay of hormones (estrogens and oxytocin) and local regulators (prostaglandins) induces and regulates labor (FIGURE 46.19). Estrogens, which reach their highest level in the mother's blood during the last weeks of pregnancy, trigger the formation of oxytocin receptors on the uterus. Oxytocin, produced by the fetus and the mother's posterior pituitary, stimulates powerful contractions by the smooth muscles of the uterus. Oxytocin also stimulates the placenta to secrete prostaglandins, which enhance the contractions. In turn, the physical and emotional stresses associated with the contractions stimulate the release of more oxytocin and prostaglandins, a positive feedback system that underlies the three stages of labor.

Birth, or parturition, occurs through a series of strong, rhythmic uterine contractions, commonly known as labor (FIGURE 46.20). The first stage is the opening up and thinning of the cervix, ending with complete dilation. The second stage is expulsion, or delivery, of the baby. Continuous strong contractions force the fetus down and out of the uterus and vagina. The umbilical cord is cut and clamped at this time. The final stage of labor is delivery of the placenta, which normally follows the baby.

Lactation is an aspect of postnatal care unique to mammals. After birth, decreasing levels of progesterone free the anterior pituitary from negative feedback and allow prolactin secretion. Prolactin stimulates milk production after a delay of 2 or 3 days. The release of milk from the mammary glands is controlled by oxytocin (see p. 962 and FIGURE 45.6).

Reproductive Immunology

Pregnancy is an immunological enigma. Half of the embryo's genes are inherited from the father, and thus many of the chemical markers present on the surface of the embryo will be foreign to the mother. Why, then, does the mother not reject the embryo as a foreign body as she would repel a tissue or organ graft bearing antigens from another person? Reproductive immunologists are working to solve this puzzle.

A major key to the puzzle is a tissue called the trophoblast (see FIGURE 47.15). Arising along with the embryo itself from the blastocyst, the trophoblast brings about implantation by growing into the endometrium and later develops into the fetal part of the placenta (see FIGURES 46.16 and FIGURES 46.17). To some extent, the trophoblast is a barrier separating the embryo from maternal tissue, but, like the embryo, it carries paternal antigens on the surfaces of its cells. So how can it protect the embryo from rejection?

Several lines of research suggest that the trophoblast prevents an immune response against the embryo by somehow interfering with the mother's T lymphocytes, important players in the immune system. For example, there is evidence that the trophoblast produces a chemical signal that induces the development of "suppressor" T cells in the uterus. It is proposed that the suppressor T cells prevent other T cells from attacking the foreign tissue, perhaps by blocking the action of interleukin-2, a cytokine required for a normal immune response (see FIGURES 43.11 and FIGURES 43.13).

An interesting part of the suppressor-cell hypothesis is the suggestion that the suppressor cells act, paradoxically, only after other white blood cells have identified the trophoblast as foreign tissue and have taken the first steps of the immune response. If this immunological alarm is not intense enough--that is, if the father's cell surface antigens are too similar to the mother-s--then no suppressor cells arise, and the embryo is attacked by the immune system. Similarity between maternal and paternal antigens may thus account for some cases of women who have multiple miscarriages. In support of this idea, some frequent miscarriers have been successfully treated before pregnancy with sensitizing injections of their mate's antigens.

A very different hypothesis is that the trophoblast secretes an enzyme that rapidly breaks down local supplies of tryptophan, an amino acid necessary for T cell survival and function. At least in mice, this enzyme seems to be essential for maintaining pregnancy. And more recent work on mice has led to yet another hypothesis, which involves a nonspecific part of the defense system. A protein found on mouse trophoblast cells protects the embryo's cells from attack by complement (see FIGURE 43.17). Scientists are now searching for comparable proteins made by the human trophoblast.

Contraception

Contraception, the deliberate prevention of pregnancy, can be achieved in a number of ways. Some contraceptive methods prevent the release of mature eggs (secondary oocytes) and sperm from gonads, others prevent fertilization by keeping sperm and egg apart, and still others prevent implantation of an embryo or abort the embryo (FIGURE 46.21, p. 994). The following brief introduction to the biology of these methods makes no pretense of being a contraception manual. For more complete information, you should consult a physician or health center personnel.

Fig 46-21. Mechanisms of some contraceptive methods. Red arrows indicate where these methods, devices, or products interfere with the flow of events from the production of sperm and egg (secondary oocyte) to the birth of a baby.

Fertilization can be prevented by abstinence from sexual intercourse or by any of several barriers that keep live sperm from contacting the egg. Temporary abstinence, often called the rhythm method of birth control or natural family planning, depends on refraining from intercourse when conception is most likely. Because the egg can survive in the oviduct for 24 to 48 hours and sperm for up to 72 hours, a couple practicing temporary abstinence should not engage in intercourse during the few days before and after ovulation. The most effective methods for timing ovulation combine several indicators, including changes in cervical mucus and body temperature during the menstrual cycle. Thus, natural family planning requires that the couple be knowledgeable about these physiological signs. A pregnancy rate of 10%  to 20%  is typically reported for couples practicing natural family planning. (Pregnancy rate is the number of women who become pregnant during a year out of every 100 women using a particular family-planning method, expressed as a percentage.) Some couples use the natural family planning method to increase the probability of conception.

The several barrier methods of contraception that block the sperm from meeting the egg have pregnancy rates of less than 10% . The condom, used by the male, is a thin, latex rubber or natural membrane sheath that fits over the penis to collect the semen. The barrier device most commonly used by females is the diaphragm, a dome-shaped rubber cap fitted into the upper portion of the vagina before intercourse. Both of these devices are more effective when used in conjunction with a spermicidal (sperm-killing) foam or jelly. More recently introduced barriers include the cervical cap, which fits tightly around the opening of the cervix and is held in place for a prolonged period by suction, and the vaginal pouch, or female condom.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs), which are small plastic or metal devices that fit into the uterine cavity, prevent implantation of the blastocyst in the uterus. IUDs have a low pregnancy rate but cause harmful effects in a small percentage of women. Problems of persistent vaginal bleeding, uterine infection, perforation of the uterus, tubal pregnancy (implantation of the embryo in the oviduct), and spontaneous expulsion of the devices have been reported and have led to lawsuits and the removal of IUDs from the market. Newer IUD products that prevent implantation by delivering synthetic progesterone locally to the endometrium are now available.

As a method of preventing fertilization, coitus interruptus, or withdrawal (removal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation), is unreliable. Sperm may be present in secretions that precede ejaculation, and a lapse in timing or willpower can result in late withdrawal.

Except for complete abstinence from sexual intercourse, the methods that prevent the release of gametes are the most effective means of birth control. Chemical contraceptives--birth control pills--have pregnancy rates of less than 1% , and sterilization is nearly 100%  effective. The most commonly used birth control pills are combinations of synthetic estrogens and a synthetic progestin (progesteronelike hormone). These two hormones act by negative feedback to stop the release of GnRH by the hypothalamus, and of FSH (an estrogen effect) and LH (a progestin effect) by the pituitary. By blocking LH release, the progestin prevents ovulation. As a backup mechanism, the estrogen inhibits FSH secretion so that no follicles develop. Combination birth control pills can be prescribed in high doses as morning after pills (MAP). Taken within 3 days of unprotected intercourse, they prevent fertilization or implantation, with an effectiveness of about 75% .

A second type of birth control pill, called the minipill, contains only progestin. The minipill prevents fertilization mainly by altering a woman's cervical mucus so that it blocks sperm from entering the uterus. In 1990, the FDA approved a progestin-only capsule (Norplant) that is implanted under the skin. Steadily releasing a tiny amount of progestin into the blood, the implant produces effective birth control for about 5 years. A product called Depo-Provera is a synthetic progestin that is injected every 3 months.

Birth control pills have been the center of much debate, particularly because of long-term harmful effects of the estrogens in combination pills. No solid evidence exists for cancers caused by the pill, but cardiovascular problems are a major concern. Birth control pills have been implicated in abnormal blood clotting, atherosclerosis, and heart attacks. Smoking while using chemical contraception increases the risk of mortality tenfold or more. Although the pill places women at risk for these diseases, it eliminates the dangers of pregnancy; women on birth control pills have mortality rates about one-half those of pregnant women.

Sterilization is the permanent prevention of gamete release. Tubal ligation in women usually involves cauterizing or tying off (ligating) a section of the oviducts to prevent eggs from traveling into the uterus. Vasectomy in men is the cutting of each vas deferens to prevent sperm from entering the urethra. Both male and female sterilization are relatively safe and free from harmful effects. Both are also difficult to reverse, so the procedures should be considered permanent.

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy in progress. Spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, is very common; it occurs in as many as one-third of all pregnancies, often before the woman is even aware she is pregnant. In addition, each year about 1.5 million women in the United States choose abortions performed by physicians. A drug called mifepristone, or RU486, developed in France, enables a woman to terminate pregnancy nonsurgically within the first 7 weeks. An analog of progesterone, RU486 blocks progesterone receptors in the uterus, thus preventing progesterone from maintaining pregnancy. It is taken with a small amount of prostaglandin to induce uterine contractions.

Of all contraceptives for sexually active individuals, latex condoms are the only ones that offer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. This protection is, however, not absolute.





 Modern technology offers solutions for some reproductive problems

Recent scientific and technological advances have made it possible to deal with problems of reproduction in striking ways. For example, it is now possible to diagnose many genetic diseases and congenital (present at birth) disorders while the fetus is in the uterus. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are invasive techniques in which amniotic fluid or fetal cells are obtained for genetic analysis (see FIGURE 14.17). Noninvasive procedures usually use high-frequency sound waves, or ultrasound imaging, to detect fetal condition (FIGURE 46.22). An alternate new technique relies on the fact that a few fetal blood cells leak across the placenta into the mother's bloodstream. A blood sample from the mother yields enough fetal cells that can be identified with specific antibodies (which bind to proteins on the surface of fetal cells) and then tested for genetic disorders.

Diagnosing genetic diseases of fetuses poses important ethical questions. To date, essentially all detectable disorders remain untreatable in the uterus, and many cannot be corrected even after birth. Parents may be faced with difficult decisions about whether to terminate a pregnancy or cope with a child who may have profound defects and a short life expectancy. These are complex issues that demand careful, informed thought and competent counseling.

In the past 25 years, several techniques have been developed to assist childless couples who want to have offspring. For cases of male infertility, sperm from anonymous donors are widely available from sperm banks. Sperm are deposited in the vagina or cervix when it is possible for the woman to conceive. Another procedure, called in vitro fertilization, was developed for women whose oviducts are blocked. Ova are surgically removed following hormonal stimulation of the follicles. The ova are then fertilized in culture dishes in a laboratory. After about 2half; days, when the embryo has reached the eight-cell stage, it is placed in the uterus and allowed to implant. In vitro fertilization is costly but has a success rate similar to the pregnancy rate resulting from insemination by sexual intercourse. Embryos can be frozen for later use if the first attempt is unsuccessful. A couple may choose to have oocytes obtained from another woman fertilized with the male partner's sperm, although more serious ethical issues must be resolved when donors are used. Thousands of children have thus far been conceived by in vitro fertilization, and there is no evidence of any abnormalities associated with this procedure.

One area of reproductive research that has traditionally received little attention is male contraception. Male chemical contraceptives have proved elusive. Testosterone will block the release of pituitary gonadotropins, but testosterone itself stimulates spermatogenesis. Estrogens are effective, but they inhibit sex drive and can be feminizing. The best prospects so far are for antagonists of GnRH, which are potent inhibitors of spermatogenesis. Several experimental drugs and birth control techniques for both men and women are currently being tested.

In this chapter we have considered the structural and physiological bases of animal reproduction. The next chapter focuses on the mechanics of development that transform a zygote into an animal form and on other topics in animal development.
