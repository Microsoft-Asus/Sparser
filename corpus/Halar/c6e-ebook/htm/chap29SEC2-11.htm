Even so, bryophyte sporophytes are not capable of living apart from their maternal gametophytes. A bryophyte sporophyte remains attached to its parental gametophyte throughout the sporophyte’s lifetime, dependent on the gametophyte for supplies of sugars, amino acids, minerals, and water.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Bryophytes have the smallest and simplest sporophytes of all modern plant groups, consistent with the hypothesis that sporophytes started small and simple, with larger and more complex sporophytes evolving only later in vascular plants. Among bryophytes, liverworts have the simplest sporophytes. You would need to use a magnifying glass to see their tiny bodies, which consist of a short stalk bearing a round sporangium with a protective epidermis enclosing developing spores. At the other end of the stalk, a nutritive foot is embedded in gametophyte tissues (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.17</span>). Hornwort and moss sporophytes are larger and more complex. For example, hornwort sporophytes, which superficially resemble grass blades (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.15b</span>), possess a cuticle. The sporophytes of hornworts and mosses possess epidermal stomata similar to those of vascular plants.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-17','../fig/big/fig29-17.jpg','fig29-17');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-17.jpg" alt="fig29-17" name="myfig29-17"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-17.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Sporophyte of <span class="Emphasis1">Marchantia</span>, a liverwort.</span> The tiny spore-producing sporophyte remains attached to the tissues of the parent gametophyte, which continues to nourish the sporophyte (LM).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Moss sporophytes are fairly conspicuous and familiar to most people. Though green and photosynthetic when young, moss sporophytes turn tan or brownish red when they are ready to release their spores, often remaining visible for months after spore discharge has occurred (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.15c</span>). Moss sporophytes consist of a <span class="Emphasis2">foot,</span> an elongated stalk known as a <span class="Emphasis2">seta,</span> and a spore-producing organ, the <span class="Emphasis2">sporangium,</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">capsule</span> (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.16</span>). The foot gathers sugars, amino acids, water, and minerals from the parent gametophyte via transfer cells. The seta conducts these materials to the capsule, which uses the resources to produce spores. In most mosses, the seta becomes elongated, which elevates the capsule and enhances spore dispersal.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The moss capsule (sporangium) is the site of meiosis and spore production; up to 50 million spores can be generated by one capsule. When the capsule is immature, it is covered with a protective cap of gametophyte tissue, the <span class="Emphasis2">calyptra,</span> but this cap is lost when the capsule is ready to release spores. The upper part of the capsule, known as a <span class="Emphasis2">peristome,</span> is often specialized for gradual spore discharge (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 29.18</span>). As a result, the capsule sprinkles spores rather than dumping them out all at once. This gradual release allows mosses to take advantage of periodic wind gusts that can carry spores long distances.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig29-18','../fig/big/fig29-18.jpg','fig29-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig29-18.jpg" alt="fig29-18" name="myfig29-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 29-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A moss sporangium with a "spore-shaker" tip.</span> At the tip of the sporangium of the moss <span class="Emphasis1">Brachythecium</span>, two rings of "teeth" regulate the gradual release of spores from the capsule.

Drying causes the teeth to separate, allowing spores to disperse from the "shaker" you see here (SEM).</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
