SEOUL , June 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Continued devaluation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is expected to deal a heavy blow to South Korea 's crisis-ridden economy .
The Japanese yen broke through the 140 level against the U.S. dollar Monday while Tokyo wrestled with an economic slump .
The yen 's slump , it is believed , will last for some time .
Economic analysts here said there is a possibility that the yen will depreciate to the 160 level late this year if steps are not taken to strengthen it .
As a result , South Korean goods will lose their competitiveness against Japanese products in the international markets , analysts stressed .
`` Most of our exporters have already reduced export prices at the request of buyers , but South Korea ca n't afford to reduce prices further simply because of the yen 's continued weakness , '' Kim Bee -tai , a researcher with the Institute of the Far - East Community , said on Tuesday .
If the yen remains at the 140 level for one year , South Korea will see a reduction of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in exports and an import cut amounting to 400 million dollars , according to the Bank of Korea .
When and if the yen eventually plunges to the 150 level , the competitiveness of South Korea 's exports will be nearly completely eroded , said the LG Economic Research Institute when the yen tumbled to 139.2 against the dollar on May 29 .
`` The impact of the yen 's depreciation against the U.S. dollar will begin to show in the next quarter , thus threatening Korea 's trade surplus , '' said Kim Chang -uh , export director of the Ministry of Commerce , Industry and Energy .
The yen 's devaluation makes it difficult for South Korea to realize its trade surplus target of 25 billion dollars this year .
Statistics show that the country registered a surplus on a customs clearance basis of 16.1 billion U.S. dollars in the first months of this year .
Those hit hardest by the falling yen will include South Korea 's electronics , automobiles , home appliances , and shipping industries , which are competing fiercely with their Japanese counterparts in the world markets , analysts said .
Meanwhile , imports of much-needed major raw materials , parts and capital goods , including machinery , steel and chemical goods will decline sharply .
South Korean President Kim Dae -jung has expressed deep concern over the situation , acknowledging that his country 's already beleaguered economy will be hit hard by a devalued yen .
Moreover , he added , this comes at a time when his nation is preoccupied with raising exports to overcome the ongoing financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans made by financial institutions .
