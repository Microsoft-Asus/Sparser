It started with angry words .
Then someone got hit in the head with a beer bottle .
And the fight was on , first inside the Spirits Dance Club and then on the corner outside , in the heart of Austin 's Sixth Street entertainment district .
By the time police arrived a few minutes later , on this cool night before Thanksgiving in 1997 , two men had been stabbed.A third was badly beaten .
A fourth lay just inside the club , dying from knife wounds .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Three of the attackers , detectives later learned , were members of the notorious Texas Syndicate prison gang .</ENAMEX>
A witness was with the Pistoleros prison gang .
Five years ago , that many members of prison gangs at one crime scene might have surprised police .
No more .
In what authorities warn is a growing menace , prison gangs driven by racial and geographic animosities are coming of age in Austin and most other major Texas cities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In the past few years , some prison gangs have begun recruiting members of youth street gangs as soldiers in a growing crime network seeking to gain control of Texas ' illegal drug markets </ENAMEX>.
Their methods : murders , shootings , beatings and home invasion robberies .
Statewide , police estimate that prison gang members may have been involved in as many as 30 killings in four years .
In Austin , police say the death toll is six in just two years .
`` If we do n't stop these prison gangs , Texas cities could look like Chicago did in the 1930s , '' warns Allan Polunsky , chairman of the state prison system 's governing board .
`` This is not just something that 's going on in the barrios .
It 's not just drug dealers trying to knock each other off .
It 's organized crime , pure and simple . ''
Prison gang crime recently burst into public awareness with a vengeance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In June , two of three ex-convicts charged in the dragging death of a black man in Jasper in East Texas were identified by authorities as sympathizers of a white-supremacist prison gang , the Aryan Brotherhood , that is blamed for eight slayings in four years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In July , 16 members of the Mexican Mafia , Texas ' largest prison gang , were indicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges in San Antonio .
Federal prosecutors blame the group for 14 killings in four years , including San Antonio 's worst mass murder , the shotgun massacre of five people in a duplex a year ago</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In August , Corpus Christi detectives arrested nine suspected prison gang members in three of the city 's nine slayings this year</ENAMEX> .
Still on the street , though , were more than 1,400 paroled prison gang members who police say now live in that area .
The growing alliance between street and prison gangs is `` one big problem , '' says Travis County Sheriff Margo Frasier , whose 2,500 jail cells are filled with increasing numbers of prison gang members and wannabees .
`` These people hate each other just because they are members of different gangs , '' she said .
`` They deal in intimidation .
And that mentality is a problem , whether it 's out on the street or inside a jail or a prison . ''
About 5,000 convicts in Texas prisons -- more people than live in Marble Falls -- are confirmed members of the seven prison gangs and three lesser `` security threat '' groups , a number that has been increasing steadily during the past seven years .
Prison officials say there are as many more whom they suspect -- but have not confirmed -- of gang membership .
Thousands more are free on parole , officials say , although they have no specific count because they only recently began keeping track of gang members separately .
Of the 30,000 convicts who have been paroled or freed from prison this year , officials estimate that at least 3,000 probably have some gang affiliation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Even as Texas has locked up more gang members in prison for longer terms in recent years , isolating them in solitary cells and monitoring their mail to thwart communication with the outside world , local police and prison officials say the gangs ' influence on the street continues to grow .
A key reason is the growing affiliation with teen-age street gangs that has allowed prison gangs to reach out in ever more violent and organized ways</ENAMEX> .
In a report released Thursday , a state Senate committee studying gangs estimated there may be 145,000 members in 3,276 prison and street gangs in Texas .
That is second only to California , which has 4,927 gangs .
For law-abiding Texans , the problem means continued burglaries and theft , the property crimes that feed the drug trade , and exposure to the gangs ' hair trigger for violence .
`` The broader issue here is the level of violence and what to do about it , '' said Beth Pelz , an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Houston - Downtown who has studied prison gangs for 15 years .
`` The younger members are spontaneous , unpredictable ... .
They are very impulsive .
You ask them what they 'll be doing in five years , and they say they 'll be dead . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">While crimes such as drive-by shootings , auto thefts and assaults committed by street gangs across Texas has declined during the past two years -- down 28 percent in Austin -- violence by street gangs in many cases has become more focused and more organized , police say , as the street gangs have joined forces with prison gangs competing for a bigger piece of the drug and crime market </ENAMEX>.
`` Violence always has been a way of life for these gangs , but it 's reaching back to the streets more now , '' said Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Wayne Scott , who has 26 years of experience in the prison business .
`` Human life has no value to these people . ''
A case in point , police say , is the Austin stabbing death of Anthony Reed .
A furious fight Reed and two friends had been partying at Spirits Dance Club on Nov. 26 , 1997 , when a fight started after a club patron became jealous when another man talked with , maybe touched , his girlfriend .
Bouncers quickly moved the fracas outside .
By the time police arrived a few minutes later , Chauncey Arnold , 21 , and Willis Earls Jr. , 19 , were bleeding from severe stab wounds .
Reed was found unconscious just inside the club .
In court documents , witnesses described the fight as vicious , furious -- `` Hispanics against blacks ... .
Everyone was fighting . ''
In subsequent interviews and through their tattoos , police identified two of the suspects -- Henry Granado Jr. and Abraham `` A.B . ''
Palacios -- as members or affiliates of the Texas Syndicate , the granddaddy of Texas prison gangs , with a longstanding reputation for violence .
Austin police were already well acquainted with the Texas Syndicate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">On Feb. 3 , 1997 , Joe Martinez , 24 , was fatally shot in the temple by someone who fired through a window of his home in the 800 block of West Oltorf Street in South Austin , where he was watching television with his brothers .
Police identified one of the suspects in the killing as a `` prospecto '' -- a Texas Syndicate recruit who allegedly was paid $ 200 for the hit , ordered because gang members thought Martinez had snitched to police</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">On Oct. 25 , 1997 , Juan Carlos Sandoval , 18 , was shot to death at the Travis Park apartments in the 1100 block of East Oltorf Street after being assaulted by as many as 12 men whom police identified as Texas Syndicate members or wannabees</ENAMEX> .
Motive : to avenge disrespect Sandoval had shown to a Texas Syndicate member during a disagreement over a cellular telephone .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">On April 2 , Christopher Rene Lopez , 19 , and another man were driving in Southeast Austin when a pedestrian -- whom police later identified as a Texas Syndicate recruit -- fatally shot Lopez through a window</ENAMEX> .
The car crashed into a house .
Several weeks ago , Lopez 's father and cousin were jailed on charges of attempted murder in the Aug. 20 ambush shooting of Remberto Juarez , 20 , also outside Spirits Dance Club , in what police say was retaliation for Lopez 's death .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Police say two other slayings earlier this year in the Austin area probably were carried out by members of two predominantly Hispanic prison gangs -- the statewide Texas Syndicate and the San Antonio -based Mexican Mafia -- that are competing for a stake in Austin 's drug trade</ENAMEX> .
`` Most of their victims are each other , '' said Lt. Manuel Pena , head of the Austin Police Department 's gang enforcement unit .
Many more gang slayings have been reported across Texas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Outside San Marcos , the bullet-riddled body of Austin resident Willie Herbert Jr. , 26 , was found dumped near Five - Mile Dam on Jan. 14 , 1997 .
Prison officials say he was killed in a gang hit</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In Corpus Christi , authorities blame the Raza Unida prison gang for three of the nine murders since January</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In Houston , several prison gangs are believed involved in a dozen killings in two years</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In San Antonio , headquarters for the Mexican Mafia -- the largest prison gang in terms of imprisoned membership , with more than 1,200 members inside prison -- narcotics Detective Val Lopez estimates the gang has had a role in as many as 100 slayings since 1992</ENAMEX> .
`` Back years ago , we had street gangs , and they were involved in crime .
-LRB- But -RRB- they had boundaries on what they would do , '' Lopez said .
`` As far as a lot of these prison gangs go , there are no boundaries .
That 's what makes them dangerous . ''
Confidential police intelligence reports bolster his words .
`` Coldhearted ... violent ... loyal , '' a Texas Department of Public Safety report says of the Texas Syndicate .
The report says that to join , prospective members must kill someone the gang hates .
`` Death is the only way out , '' the report notes .
While the `` blood in , blood out '' code might be exaggerated , authorities say there 's no disputing that violence binds members together .
The recruiting ground In years past , police say , most Texas Syndicate members who surfaced in Austin tried to keep a low profile or , as one undercover detective explains it , `` just try to deal their dope and lay low . ''
Back then , teen-age street gangs with names like Latin Kings , Outlawz or East Gran Varrio posed the greatest menace with drive-by shootings , assaults and murders , said Ralph Dela Fuente , a detective in Austin 's gang unit .
But as police cracked down and the young gangsters were sent to prison beginning in the early 1990s , they were introduced to the Texas Syndicate , Mexican Mafia and other entrenched prison gangs that had begun organizing along racial lines more than a decade earlier .
Many joined -- because of peer pressure , for protection from sexual attacks , extortion and assaults .
Or for prestige .
`` By 1995 or 1996 , they had been down -LRB- in prison -RRB- for five or six years , they 'd completed their sentence , they were 24 , 25 or 26 , they were freshly back from the joint , and they met back up with their old homeys , '' Dela Fuente said .
`` What happened ?
A lot of these homeys who had been in trouble , but had never hit the big time , got involved in more serious crimes . ''
In Austin , those young prison gang members also started recruiting members directly from teen-age street gangs -- a trend that police in several other large Texas cities began to notice two to three years ago .
Before that , the only way to get into a prison gang had been to serve time in prison .
`` The Texas Syndicate needs soldiers out on the street , not locked up someplace , '' Dela Fuente said .
The alliance between prison and street gang members has become so close , he said , that `` if these street gangs were corporations , most of them would be subsidiaries of the Texas Syndicate or the Mexican Mafia . ''
At the same time , prison gangs have increasingly focused their recruiting efforts in county jails in Austin and other cities , rather than mostly in prisons .
In the jails , gang members often are not isolated from other prisoners like they are in prison .
New recruits who served their time and went back to the streets began to bolster the prison gangs ' street force , and those who went on to prison bolstered their numbers there .
`` The growth was happening on both sides of the fence , '' said Sam Buentello , the prison system 's top gang expert .
Since 1991 , the ranks of confirmed gang members have swelled from 1,238 to more than 5,000 in prison -- faster than the overall prison growth rate .
`` Their numbers are up some , but the real increase is in crime , '' a gang detective in Corpus Christi said .
`` We have more unsolved homicides , and a big reason for that is the prison gangs .
They are much more professional about the way they do them , they do n't talk , and it 's harder to get information to solve those cases . ''
In Austin , police report much the same story .
So far , though , suspects have been jailed in four of the six killings linked to prison gangs , and police say they have solid leads in the others .
` Street tax ' collections Police estimate that only about 80 members of the Texas Syndicate are among the 2,500 or so gang members and wannabees loose on Austin streets .
Yet `` Ese Te , '' as members call it after its initials in Spanish , probably ranks first in turf and clout .
On the streets , in the neighborhoods of East and South and North Austin that the Texas Syndicate claims as its turf , the gang 's business fits a pattern of extortion and drugs , police say .
It collects a 10 percent `` street tax '' from retail drug dealers , many of whom it supplies with marijuana , cocaine , crack cocaine or heroin .
If members profit from crimes on their own , they must pay the tax to the gang .
`` If you do n't pay , TS tells you : ` You move out , or we come in and rob you , or we 'll shoot up your house , to where we get the message across to you that you should start paying , ' '' Dela Fuente said .
Police statistics bear out those words .
In dozens of aggravated assaults in the past year , suspected drug dealers were the victims and prison gang members or affiliates were the prime suspects .
In some cases , investigators say , drug dealers are paying a tax to both the Texas Syndicate and the Mexican Mafia , Austin 's No. 2 prison gang , just to be safe .
In recent months , authorities have noticed another trend : gang members ' ownership or control of several area businesses , mom-and-pop restaurants and beer joints mostly , where gang members ostensibly go to work after they get out of prison .
Police suspect that the small businesses are little more than a front to launder drug money and cover for other illegal activities such as burglary , auto theft and robbery .
Also , there are indications that Texas ' growing threat from prison gangs could be spreading regionally , even internationally .
Local and federal authorities in El Paso for several months have been watching forays by the Barrio Azteca prison gang into the Mexican drug trade and into California .
Under increasing pressure from police and prison officials , the gangs have begun to change .
To thwart detection in prison and a trip to solitary confinement , members have begun shunning the traditional mark of membership , the distinctive tattoos known as `` plaques . ''
In Austin , police confirm , Texas Syndicate members have begun referring to themselves as `` cuernos '' -- horns in Spanish -- rather than `` carnales , '' a loose translation for brother in Spanish , as they had .
Instead of a TS tattoo , they are now sporting tiny horns on their bodies .
In El Paso , some street gangs now call themselves `` party crews . ''
But authorities in both cities say their illegal bent remains the same .
To thwart the gangs , state and local authorities in recent months quietly have begun beefing up plans for a new gang computer network , so they can more quickly exchange information about prison gangs , their members and their criminal activities .
Prison officials want to spend more than $ 100 million on four new prisons to house Texas ' most incorrigible convicts , hundreds of them gang members .
And during the next two years , they also want to spend $ 1 million more on special gang-enforcement measures .
At the same time , Texas ' juvenile corrections agency wants to spend millions more to build more single-prisoner cells , where gang members and incorrigible street toughs can be isolated .
Lopez , the San Antonio narcotics officer , is among those who say such steps are needed .
`` When I first heard about the Mexican Mafia years ago , I thought ... that 's in New York or Chicago or New Orleans .
It 's not here in San Antonio , '' said Lopez , who attended high school in San Antonio with several people who now are Mexican Mafia members -- including Heriberto Huerta , the reputed president , who is in federal prison .
`` But it was here .
And it 's not going to just go away , '' Lopez said .
Polunsky , the prison board chairman , echoed those sentiments .
`` If you 're in a metro area in Texas and you do n't think prison gangs are there , you 're mistaken , '' he said .
`` They are everywhere . ''
