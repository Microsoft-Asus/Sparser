CAIRO , April 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Arab League on Sunday criticized the United States for adopting double standards concerning the defense issue of Middle East countries .
Assistant Secretary General Mohamed Zakaria Ismail said in a statement that the U.S. opposes Russia 's help in maintaining and developing Syria 's defense weapons while it arms Israel .
`` We regret the U.S. attitude of opposing Russia 's defense assistance to Syria while it pledges to give all kinds of military aid , without limits , to Israel , which is occupying Arab territories , '' Ismail said .
The Arab League `` categorically rejects '' the U.S. double standards , the league official stressed .
Russian companies and research centers were reportedly helping upgrade Syria 's defense system , which was installed by the former Soviet Union in the 1960s-70s .
The U.S. has expressed opposition to the Russian move .
The American approach will not be an encouraging element on the way to make a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , particularly as the United States always declares that it is determined to help realize peace in the region , Ismail said .
He voiced the league 's support for Syria and its right to get the arms needed to upgrade national defense , especially its Golan Heights is still under the Israeli occupation .
Israel occupied the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War .
