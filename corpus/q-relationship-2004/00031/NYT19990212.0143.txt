AMMAN --
In death , as in life , King Hussein dominates Jordan .
Even at the swearing-in of his son and successor , Abdullah , on Feb. 7 , he remained the focus of attention .
Before the ceremony , a workman , busy dusting the podium on which the new king was to take his oath of office , was called away to the more important task of wiping clean a nearby portrait of Hussein .
King Abdullah himself lingered longer in silent tribute to his father 's picture than over the oath itself .
The wailing from the gallery at every mention of the old king outdid the applause at the inauguration of the new .
Jordanians seem consumed with genuine grief at the death of the man who had been their king for nearly half a century .
During the three days he lay dying in an Amman hospital , thousands waited outside the gates .
With the news of his death , crowds of young men surged through the streets chanting , `` There is no god but Allah and Hussein is beloved by Allah . ''
The next day , perhaps a quarter of the population turned out for the king 's funeral , plus an array of foreign dignitaries .
How can the huge void left by the king 's death be filled ?
Quite smoothly , at least to begin with .
King Abdullah has been quick to affirm the policies of his father , including peace with Israel and a gradual -LRB- very gradual -RRB- process of democratization .
Although he was promoted only two weeks before he took over and has no political experience , he scarcely set a foot wrong during the very public diplomatic encounters at the funeral .
His uncle and rival , Prince Hassan , who served as crown prince for 34 years before being unceremoniously sacked last month , both stood by his elbow and generously sent him an open letter of submission and support .
Prince Hamzeh , his 18-year -old half-brother and the elder son of Hussein 's widow , Queen Noor , was appointed crown prince .
For the sake of stability , and out of respect for the dead king , the royal family , local politicians , ordinary Jordanians and a panoply of world leaders have rallied behind King Abdullah .
The support is not only moral .
The United States has announced an extra $ 300 million in aid to Jordan over the next three years .
The United Arab Emirates has promised to deposit money in the Central Bank , and Saudi Arabia , which fell out with Jordan during the Gulf war over its forgiving stance towards Iraq , has promised to resume its once-huge handouts .
Amman 's stock market barely budged in the face of King Hussein 's imminent death , and the Central Bank had little trouble defending the Jordanian dinar .
Jordan has not missed a beat , either economically or politically .
In the long run , however , change is inevitable .
Although Jordan is theoretically a constitutional monarchy , its parliament has always acted on the initiative of the king .
During King Hussein 's recent seven-month absence in America for cancer treatment , an air of paralysis hung over the country .
The government of the day lost popularity over a scandal about contaminated water , but Jordan 's political institutions were unable to cope with the crisis .
King Hussein had to intervene from his sickbed to sack the prime minister and appoint a replacement .
Given the new king 's lesser experience and stature , he will find it hard to rule in such a hands-on manner .
Already some liberal members of parliament are calling for a revision of the restrictive press and electoral laws , both of which were linchpins of King Hussein 's system of limited democracy .
Although King Abdullah seems to share his father 's suspicion of political freedom , the role of future governments and parliaments is likely to expand in the face of his inexperience .
Nor can the new king hope to exert anything like the influence his father had on the world stage .
In the past 18 months , King Hussein forced Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel 's prime minister , to release the spiritual leader of Hamas in exchange for captured Israeli spies , faced down Syria 's iron-willed President Hafez Assad in a vitriolic propaganda war , persuaded both Bill Clinton and his Iraqi counterpart , Saddam Hussein , to give Jordan financial aid , and intervened personally to secure the agreement at Wye between Yasser Arafat and skeptical Israeli negotiators .
It is hard to imagine King Abdullah holding his own against such seasoned politicians , let alone wringing concessions from them .
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , epitomizing the faint air of condescension exuded by many of the Arab leaders at the funeral , called the 37-year -old king `` a very good young man . ''
In short , Jordan , bereft of its famous ruler , will be cut down to size .
King Abdullah will have to concentrate on domestic affairs , attempting to improve the faltering economy of a small , poor , desert country with few natural resources .
Unemployment has reached fully 15 percent , and economic growth is nonexistent .
Various privatization schemes have stalled , along with IMF -inspired liberalization -- and the present cabinet is closely associated with the sidelined Prince Hassan .
King Hussein won the affection of most Jordanians not through his labors as an international statesman but as someone who cared about and , over the course of his reign , improved the living standards of his subjects .
The fate of his dynasty rests on the new king 's ability to provide for the masses who flocked to his father 's funeral .
