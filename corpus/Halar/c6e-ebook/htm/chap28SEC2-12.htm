The term <span class="Emphasis1">stramenopila</span> refers to the numerous fine, hairlike projections on the flagella that are characteristic of these organisms (from the Latin <span class="Emphasis1">stramen</span>, straw, flagellum, and <span class="Emphasis1">pilos</span>, hair). In most cases, the "hairy" flagellum is paired with a smooth (nonhairy) flagellum. In the life cycles of most stramenopile groups, the only flagellated stages are motile reproductive cells.</p><p class="Header3">Oomycota (Water Molds and Their Relatives)</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Oomycotes</span> include the <span class="Emphasis2">water molds, white rusts,</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">downy mildews,</span> all examples of heterotrophic stramenopiles that lack chloroplasts. Some of these organisms are unicellular; others consist of hyphae (fine, branching filaments) that are multi-nucleated (coencytic). Hyphae in this group are analogous to the branching filaments (also called hyphae) of true fungi. However, water molds and their relatives typically have cell walls made of cellulose, while the walls of true fungi are made of another polysaccharide, chitin. The diploid condition, which is reduced in true fungi, prevails in the life cycles of most members of Oomycota. Biflagellated cells occur in the life cycles of oomycotes, while almost all true fungi lack flagella. Molecular systematics has confirmed that water molds and other oomycotes are not closely related to fungi. The similar "body plan"--a mass of thin filaments (hyphae)--is an example of convergent evolution. In both the oomycotes and fungi, the filamentous bodies have an extensive surface area, which enhances the absorption of nutrients.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Oomycota</span> means "egg fungi," a reference to the mode of sexual reproduction in water molds. A relatively large egg cell is fertilized by a smaller "sperm nucleus," forming a resistant zygote (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.16</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-16','../fig/big/fig28-16.jpg','fig28-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-16.jpg" alt="fig28-16" name="myfig28-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The life cycle of a water mold.</span> Water molds help decompose dead insects, fish, and other animals submerged in fresh water (see the hyphal mass on the goldfish in the inset).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Most water molds are decomposers that grow as cottony masses on dead algae and animals, mainly in fresh water.

They are dispersed primarily by windblown spores, but they also form flagellated zoospores at some point during their life cycles. One devastating plant pathogen, a downy mildew, threatened the French vineyards in the 1870s. Another oomycote species, <span class="Emphasis1">Phytophthora infestans</span>, causes late potato blight, which contributed to the Irish famine in the 19th century.</p><p class="Header3">Overview of the Heterokont Algae</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">The stramenopile taxa with mostly photosynthetic members are collectively called the heterokont algae, with the "hetero" referring to the two different types of flagella ("hairy" and "nonhairy"), which are characteristic of the whole stramenopile group.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The plastids of heterokont algae evolved by secondary endosymbiosis. This explains the three-membrane envelope and the presence of a small amount of eukaryotic cytoplasm within the plastid (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.5</span>). The probable ancestor of the plastids in heterokont algae was a red alga, its own plastid derived from a cyanobacterium by primary endosymbiosis. The heterokont algae include the diatoms, golden algae, and brown algae.</p><p class="Header3">Bacillariophyta (Diatoms)</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">Yellow or brown in color, <span class="Emphasis2">diatoms</span> have unique glasslike walls consisting of hydrated silica embedded in an organic matrix.

Cysts are formed by some species as resistant stages. Sexual stages are not common and involve the formation of eggs and sperm; sperm cells are amoeboid or flagellated, depending on the species.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Both freshwater and marine plankton are rich in diatoms; a bucket of water scooped from the surface of the sea may have millions of these microscopic algae. In common with golden algae and brown algae, diatoms store food reserves in the form of a glucose polymer called laminarin. Some diatoms also store food in the form of oil.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Massive accumulations of fossilized diatom walls are major constituents of the sediments known as diatomaceous earth, which is mined for its quality as a filtering medium and for many other uses.</p><p class="Header3">Chrysophyta (Golden Algae)</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Golden algae,</span> or chrysophytes (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">chrysos</span>, golden), are named for their color, which results from yellow and brown carotene and xanthophyll accessory pigments. Their cells are typically biflagellated, with both flagella attached near one end of the cell. Many golden algae live among freshwater and marine plankton. Some species are mixotrophic, absorbing dissolved organic compounds or ingesting food particles and bacteria by phagocytosis, which occurs near the base of the flagella. Most golden algae are unicellular, but some, such as the freshwater genus <span class="Emphasis1">Dinobryon</span>, are colonial (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.18</span>). If cell density reaches a certain high level, many species form resistant cysts that can remain viable for decades.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-18','../fig/big/fig28-18.jpg','fig28-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-18.jpg" alt="fig28-18" name="myfig28-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A golden alga.</span>&nbsp;<span class="Emphasis1">Dinobryon</span> is a freshwater member of this algal group.
