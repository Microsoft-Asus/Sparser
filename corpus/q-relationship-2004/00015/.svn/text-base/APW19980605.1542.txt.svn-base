UNITED NATIONS
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The Islamic Taliban on Friday condemned `` in the strongest terms '' a U.N. invitation to followers of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani to attend next week 's U.N. drug conference .
`` The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns in the strongest terms a United Nations invitation to the so-called northern alliance to represent Afghanistan '' at the conference , the Taliban 's representation office in New York said in a statement .
`` By receiving the northern alliance , the United Nations confers undue legitimacy and international status to these warlords , '' the statement said .
The Taliban army drove Rabbani from the capital Kabul in 1996 and now controls about 85 percent of the country .
Rabbani 's northern -based alliance controls about 15 percent of the territory and has been battling the Taliban .
Although Taliban holds the capital and most of the territory , the United Nations has never awarded the General Assembly seat to the Islamic movement .
The seat remains in the hands of the previous government pending a final decision .
Afghanistan is a leading source of opium-poppies , most of which are grown in Taliban -controlled areas .
The Taliban has agreed to work with the United Nations to curb production and encourage farmers to grow alternate crops .
But U.N. officials said so long as the General Assembly does not remove the seat , the former leadership will still be entitled to attend U.N. conferences as the legitimate government of Afghanistan .
