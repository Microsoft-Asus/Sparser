CANBERRA , June 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Australia 's uniform national gun laws ran into hard resistance from gun-owners and pro-gun politicians despite the federal government 's resolve to put through stricter gun controls</ENAMEX> .
The massacre of 35 people by a lone gunman at Port Arthur , Tasmania , in April prompted the federal and state governments to agree on principles of uniform gun laws .
The long-due nationwide laws would save Australia from going down the same road as the United States did , where gun-related violence was part of daily life , Prime Minister John Howard said .
However , criticism emerged immediately after the federal government and police ministers of the eight states and territories reached agreement on May 10 .
Gun owners ' organizations said that Howard made the decision on emotional rather than rational basis .
Federal and state parliamentarians received death threat from gun supporters .
Howard wore a bulletproof vest when he attended a pro-gun rally in Victoria earlier this month .
Major gun lobby groups such as the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia said that stricter gun controls were not a fair go for law-abiding gun owners .
More than 100,000 people rallied around the country in protest against the new gun laws .
One of their slogan went : `` Do not give up your guns . ''
The proposed new gun laws ban all automatic and semi-automatic guns , stipulate licensing of all firearms and set up a nationwide registration system of guns .
Under the `` genuine need '' conditions imposed by the laws , over 90 percent of license holders in some parts of Australia would become ineligible , gun owners claimed .
Gun collectors , hobby shooters and farmers are among the most affected by the new gun laws .
Gun owners in rural areas said that they needed automatic weapons to hunt feral animals and shoot livestock in drought spells .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Howard has said he would not back down an inch on the stance of implementing stricter gun controls all over the country</ENAMEX> .
But the federal government and several state governments are facing pressure from within their own ranks .
The prime minister urged the state governments to accelerate the process of introducing national gun laws in face of mounting pressure from gun lobbyists .
He also implied a possible choice of a national referendum .
`` If the Australian people were given the opportunity to express a view on this matter , it would express it overwhelmingly in favor of what the government is proposing , '' he said .
However , local analysts said they did not expect any nationwide gun law to be in place in the near future .
