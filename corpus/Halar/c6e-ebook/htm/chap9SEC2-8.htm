This step, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, is accomplished by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk1.gif">&nbsp;
		 Pyruvate’s carboxyl group, which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. (This is the first step in respiration where CO<SUB>2</SUB> is released.) 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk2.gif">&nbsp;
		 The remaining two-carbon fragment is oxidized to form a compound named acetate (the ionized form of acetic acid). An enzyme transfers the extracted electrons to NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, storing energy in the form of NADH. 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk3.gif">&nbsp;
		 Finally, coenzyme A, a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached to the acetate by an unstable bond that makes the acetyl group (the attached acetate) very reactive. The product of this chemical grooming, acetyl CoA, is now ready to feed its acetate into the Krebs cycle for further oxidation.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig9-10','../fig/big/fig9-10.jpg','fig9-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig9-10.jpg" alt="fig9-10" name="myfig9-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 9-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.</span> A complex of several enzymes catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text.

The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 9.11</span>). You can see in the diagram that for each turn of the Krebs cycle, two carbons enter in the relatively reduced form of acetate (step 1), and two different carbons leave in the completely oxidized form of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (steps 3 and 4). The acetate joins the cycle by its enzymatic addition to the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate. Subsequent steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate, giving off CO<SUB>2</SUB> as "exhaust." It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that accounts for the "cycle" in the Krebs cycle. Except for the enzyme that catalyzes step 6, which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, all the Krebs cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig9-11','../fig/big/fig9-11.jpg','fig9-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig9-11.jpg" alt="fig9-11" name="myfig9-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 9-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A closer look at the Krebs cycle.</span> In the chemical structures, red type traces the fate of the two carbon atoms that enter the cycle via acetyl CoA (step 1), and blue type indicates the two carbons that exit the cycle as CO<SUB>2</SUB> in steps 3 and 4.

For each acetate that enters the cycle, three molecules of NAD<SUP>+</SUP> are reduced to NADH (steps 3, 4, and 8). In one oxidative reaction, step 6, electrons are transferred not to NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, but to a different electron acceptor, FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin). The reduced form, FADH<SUB>2</SUB>, donates its electrons to the electron transport chain, as does NADH. There is also a step in the Krebs cycle, step 5, that forms an ATP molecule directly by substrate-level phosphorylation, similar to the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis. But most of the ATP output of respiration results from oxidative phosphorylation, when the NADH and FADH<SUB>2</SUB> produced by the Krebs cycle relay the electrons extracted from food to the electron transport chain.

The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred during the redox reactions to NAD<SUP>+</SUP> and FAD.
