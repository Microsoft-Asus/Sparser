THE NATURE OF NERVE SIGNALS

 

 Every cell has a voltage, or membrane potential, across its plasma membrane



 

 Changes in the membrane potential of a neuron give rise to nerve impulses



 

 Nerve impulses propagate themselves along an axon



 

 Chemical or electrical communication between cells occurs at synapses



 

 Neural integration occurs at the cellular level



 

 The same neurotransmitter can produce different effects on different types of cells



Descriptions of the anatomy of neurons and nervous systems were made possible in the 18th and 19th centuries by increasingly sophisticated compound microscopes, but this did not explain how neurons communicate with each other. Toward the end of the 18th century Luigi Galvani discovered that frog muscle cells produce electricity, and in the 19th century Hermann von Helmholtz and others found that the electrical activity of nerve cells provides a means of carrying signals from one end of a cell to another and also between cells. Work over the past hundred years has shown that virtually all nerve signals are changes in the voltage across the plasma membranes of nerve cells. These voltage changes are caused by the movement of ions across the plasma membrane by way of specialized ion channels. Learning how these cellular processes work is central to an understanding of the nervous system. First we will examine the voltage gradient that exists across a cell's plasma membrane.
