Chapter 30: PLANT DIVERSITY II: THE EVOLUTION OF SEED PLANTS

OVERVIEW OF SEED PLANT EVOLUTION

   Reduction of the gametophyte continued with the evolution of seed plants

   Seeds became an important means of dispersing offspring

   Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization

   The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms



GYMNOSPERMS

   The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms

   The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers

   The life cycle of a pine demonstrates the key reproductive adaptations of seed plants



ANGIOSPERMS (FLOWERING PLANTS)

   Systematists are identifying the angiosperm clades

   The flower is the defining reproductive adaptation of angiosperms

   Fruits help disperse the seeds of angiosperms

   The life cycle of an angiosperm is a highly refined version of the alternation of generations common to all plants

   The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era

   Angiosperms and animals have shaped one another's evolution



PLANTS AND HUMAN WELFARE

   Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms

   Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource

This chapter continues the saga of how plants adapted to land and transformed Earth. The beautifully preserved squash seed in the photo, discovered in 1997 in a cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, symbolizes two important landmarks in the evolution of plants: (1) the evolution of seed plants, which led to the gymnosperms and angiosperms, the plants that dominate most modern landscapes, and (2) the emergence of the importance of seed plants to animals, specifically to humans in this case.

Why was this discovery front-page news for many newspapers and scientific journals? The cave had been occupied by humans some 8,000-10,000 years ago, and the seeds and pieces of squash fruit found there differ enough from wild varieties of the same species to suggest that humans had already begun cultivating the plants, perhaps more for gourds than for food. If this interpretation is correct, then agriculture started at about the same time--approximately 10,000 years ago--in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. (Before this discovery, scientists had been able to trace American agriculture back only about 5,000 years.) The invention of agriculture, which depends almost entirely on the cultivation and harvest of seed plants, was the single most important cultural change in the history of humanity, for it made possible the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to permanent settlements.

More generally, the seeds and other adaptations of gymnosperms and angiosperms enhanced the ability of plants to survive and reproduce in diverse terrestrial environments, and these plants became the main producers supporting the food webs of most ecosystems on land. Our study of gymnosperms and angiosperms begins with an overview of some of the key terrestrial adaptations that seed plants added to those already in place in the bryophytes and seedless vascular plants you learned about in Chapter 29.
