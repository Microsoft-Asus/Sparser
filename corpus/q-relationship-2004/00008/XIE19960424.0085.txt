Asahara , 41 , faces three charges : murder of a rebel follower , attempted murder for the sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo subway that killed 11 people and sickened thousands in March last year , and illegal drug production .
He has been indicted on 14 other charges , such as mass murder and plotting to overthrow the government and install himself as head of state , in separate trials that have not yet started .
Asahara refused to enter a plea to today 's charges .
After prosecutors read out the charges against him , he spoke for three minutes about his religious creed , then said , `` I have no intention to say anymore here . ''
He also said he did not care about restrictions on his freedom or any pain that may result from his practices to help people obtain what he called `` absolute freedom , absolute happiness and absolute joy . ''
