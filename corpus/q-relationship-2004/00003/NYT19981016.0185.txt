BOSTON --
Last May , after he held aloft the hands of John Hume and David Trimble during a Belfast concert to support the political settlement in Northern Ireland , U2 's lead singer Bono stood off to the side of the stage and regarded the two politicians with a wide grin .
`` Those boys , '' he mused , indicating Hume and Trimble with his thumb , `` should win the Nobel prize . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Bono got his wish Friday when Hume , the visionary Catholic pacifist who was the prime architect of the peace process , and Trimble , the onetime hard-liner who led a wary Protestant community to compromise with Irish nationalists , were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The award was a vindication both of Hume 's tireless efforts to bring about peace and reconcilation and Trimble 's bold departure from the traditional `` No Surrender '' siege mentality of Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom .</ENAMEX>
In a telephone interview Friday in his native Derry , the cradle of the Catholic civil rights movement of the 1960s , Hume said he was humbled .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` It 's a great honor not just for myself , but for David , and for the people of Northern Ireland , '' said Hume , 61 , leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party , which represents most Catholics in Northern Ireland .</ENAMEX>
`` This is a strong expression of international support for the process and the agreement . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">While many consider Hume to be the moral and intellectual force behind the peace process</ENAMEX> , the Nobel committee sought to balance the prize by honoring Trimble as well .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume was magnanimous in his praise of Trimble , 54 , a man for whom he had little liking before this year </ENAMEX>.
The two men will split the $ 963,000 that comes with the prize .
Trimble was in Denver with Hume 's deputy and heir apparent , Seamus Mallon , drumming up investment for Northern Ireland , when the award was announced in Oslo .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble is the newly elected first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly</ENAMEX> , which was created by the Good Friday Agreement approved overwhelmingly in May by voters on both sides of the border that splits Ireland .
Mallon is the deputy first minister .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">While Trimble used a hard-line tack in 1995 to become leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , which represents most Protestants in Northern Ireland , he has demonstrated an increasingly pragmatic and flexible approach to sharing power with Catholic nationalists</ENAMEX> .
Speaking in Denver , he accepted the award while noting that more compromise is needed before the process delivers a lasting peace .
`` I hope very much this award does n't turn out to be premature , '' he said , voicing his characteristic caution as against Hume 's optimistic tone .
There was little surprise that the peace prize was awarded to participants in the Irish peace process , which climaxed last April with the Good Friday political settlement .
More than 3,500 people have been killed in Northern Ireland , including 29 as recently as Aug. 16 in a car bombing that was the worst atrocity in the 29-year conflict .
The Nobel committee cited peace efforts in Northern Ireland once before .
In 1976 , it honored two women who created a grass-roots peace group that later collapsed amid personality disputes .
The conflict , meanwhile , dragged on .
This time , however , there is political consensus , and all of the major paramilitary groups have declared cease-fires .
Hume and Trimble were among a sizable group of Nobel candidates involved in the Irish peace settlement .
They included British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who made concessions that previous London governments refused to make , and his Irish counterpart , Bertie Ahern , who dropped his country 's territorial claim over Northern Ireland as part of the historic compromise .
Also considered were George Mitchell , the former US senator from Maine who chaired the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement ; Gerry Adams , the leader of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army , who led the republican movement away from violence and into the political mainstream ; and David Ervine , who did for loyalist paramilitaries what Adams did for republicans .
But the Nobel committee decided to confer the award on the two men who lead the largest parties representing the two main factions in Northern Ireland : Catholic nationalists who aspire to unity with the Irish Republic and Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom .
Hume and Trimble were lauded Friday by President Clinton , UN General Secretary Kofi Annan , Blair , Ahern and Nobel laureate Nelson Mandela .
`` I believe there are others , too , who deserve credit for their indispensable roles -- beginning with Gerry Adams , the Sinn Fein leader without whom there would have been no peace , '' Clinton said .
While some described Adams ' exclusion a snub , he praised the winners and urged Trimble to be more flexible in his demand for the surrender of paramilitary weapons by the IRA as a precondition to forming a power-sharing Cabinet .
`` It 's entirely within Mr. Trimble 's gift as a leader of his party to ensure that this is not premature , '' Adams told reporters in New York , where he is visiting .
Neither did Mitchell express disappointment , saying , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` Without John Hume there would not have been a peace process .
Without David Trimble there would not have been a peace agreement . ''</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">While Hume is known throughout the world as a statesman , Trimble is not .
The award was an extraordinary , international endorsement of the prickly law professor who is hated by many Catholics for his tough rhetoric and defense of the right of the Orange Order , a Protestant fraternal organization , to march in Catholic neighborhoods where they are not wanted .
Yet even some of Trimble 's harshest critics have grudging admiration for him and concede that he courageously risked the fate of other Protestant leaders who were pushed from power for their attempts to compromise with nationalists .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble has shown himself capable of leadership and compassion since taking office as first minister .</ENAMEX>
In August , he made a huge psychological and political leap by attending in the Irish Republic the funerals of three little Catholic boys who were among the 29 killed in Omagh by a Protestant republican splinter group 's bomb .
When the priest welcomed Trimble from the pulpit , the grieving Catholic congregation burst into spontaneous applause .
Speaking in Boston , where she is visiting , Mary McAleese , the first native of Northern Ireland to become president of Ireland , praised Hume , one of her heroes , and Trimble , who was once a bitter rival at Queen 's University , where both taught law .
In a thaw symbolic of the peace process , Trimble and McAleese buried their past animosities and greeted each other warmly at the funerals of the little boys in August .
`` This is a very well deserved recognition for the commitment of both men , '' she said .
`` Their goal has at times seemed impossible .
At times it even seemed unthinkable .
But with their perserverance they have succeeded in bringing us to a new situation of real hope .
This award will I hope give renewed determination to every one of us to see the process through to a successful conclusion . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Still , the Nobel prize does not resolve Trimble 's internal problems , as he faces a party mutiny by hardliners who believe he is ceding too much to Catholic nationalists without achieving IRA disarmament .</ENAMEX>
Trimble says that the IRA must begin turning in its weapons before its political representatives in Sinn Fein will be allowed to become part of the Northern Ireland Assembly 's Cabinet .
Nationalists counter that there is nothing in the agreement that mandates disarmament as a condition for government participation .
The decommissioning of weapons has become a major obstacle in the fledgling , post-agreement Northern Ireland .
But Hume said that Friday 's award was `` a clarion call to move beyond the bickering and implement the agreement .
The international community is telling us to do it .
We must do it . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Hume was at home with his wife , Pat</ENAMEX> , when someone called to say they heard on the news he had won the Nobel prize .
He said he was more humbled than euphoric .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Yet those who know Hume well say that he had regarded the Nobel prize as a culmination to a career that began on the streets of Derry in the late 1960s , when Catholics modeled their civil rights movement after that of blacks in the United States</ENAMEX> .
Protestant authorities tried to quash the movement violently , but their heavy-handed tactics only breathed life back into what had been until then a dormant IRA .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">While the violence flared , Hume was a singular , eloquent voice for reason , insisting that the problem in Ireland was not a divided island , but a divided people</ENAMEX> .
At great risk to himself , and against the wishes of most in his party , he reached out to Adams and helped him divert the republican movement away from violence and into the political mainstream .
Hume believed that once there was a cessation of violence and a unified nationalist front , unionists would have no alternative but to compromise and share power with Catholics .
He also shares power with his Catholic colleagues .
Earlier this year , he stepped aside to let Mallon become deputy first minister in the new assembly .
Reminded of Bono 's wistful thinking last May , Hume laughed .
`` Well , '' he said , `` Bono 's okay . ''
