-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The head of the U.N. refugee agency began talks Tuesday in Sierra Leone on repatriating a half-million refugees to this battle-scarred West African country .
UNHCR director Soren Jessen - Petersen flew into Sierra Leone 's capital of Freetown late Monday for meetings with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and other government officials before leaving on Wednesday .
Discussions focused on the problem of repatriating 530,000 Sierra Leoneans who have fled the country since 1991 , UNHCR officials said .
Most of the emigrees have sought refuge in neighboring Guinea , Liberia and the Gambia .
Jessen - Petersen said UNHCR had launched an urgent appeal for dlrs 7.3 million to give emergency assistance to thousands of refugees who fled Sierra Leone since January this year .
`` We are talking about life and death and the need for refugees to survive , '' Jessen - Petersen said , estimating that possibly thousands were in need of food aid .
So far , the United States had pledge dlrs one million to the problem , he added .
A 1991-96 rebel war in Sierra Leone triggered an exodus of some 380,000 refugees from the country .
A further 150,000 are believed to have fled since May last year when Kabbah 's government was ousted by troops loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma .
After spending months in exile , Kabbah was restored to power by a Nigerian -led West African intervention force in March .
