Hughes also engaged in deliberate efforts to circumvent the Department of State licensing requirement .
To this end , Hughes sought the approval of a Department of Commerce official for its 1995 activities and claims to have sought the approval of a Department of Defense monitor for some of its 1993 activities , although Hughes knew that neither official was legally authorized to issue the required license .
Hughes had important commercial interests in the P.R.C. at the time it engaged in the failure investigations .
These interests included future sales of satellites to the P.R.C. or to parties serving the P.R.C. market , and reducing the cost and improving the safety of launching satellites in the P.R.C. ii .
In 1996 , Loral and Hughes showed the P.R.C. how to improve the design and reliability of the guidance system used in the P.R.C. 's newest Long March rocket .
Loral 's and Hughes ' advice may also be useful for design and improved reliability of elements of future PRC ballistic missiles .
Loral and Hughes acted without the legally required license , although both corporations knew that a license was required .
Loral and Hughes analyzed for the P.R.C. the potential causes of a 1996 P.R.C. launch failure , identified for the P.R.C. the true cause of the failure as a particular element within the Long March rocket 's guidance unit , and provided the P.R.C. with technical assistance that may be useful not only for the P.R.C. 's commercial and military space launch programs , but for ballistic missiles as well .
In so doing , Loral and Hughes deliberately acted without the legally required license , and violated U.S. export control laws .
Although Loral and Hughes were well aware that a State Department license was required to provide assistance related to the guidance system of a P.R.C. rocket , neither company applied for or obtained the required license .
Loral was warned of the need for a license at the time it agreed to participate in the investigation , but took no action .
Loral and Hughes also failed to properly brief participants in the failure investigation of U.S. export requirements , failed to monitor the investigation as it progressed , and failed to take adequate steps to ensure that no prohibited information was passed to the P.R.C. Loral and Hughes submitted lengthy written materials analyzing the cause of the guidance system failure to the P.R.C. and to other foreign nationals .
In addition , Loral and Hughes engaged in technical discussions , including discussions about the details and causes of the guidance system failure , that were almost certainly recorded by the P.R.C. While some aspects of these discussions have been identified by the Select Committee and reviewed by independent experts retained by the Select Committee , the full range and content of these discussions remains unknown .
The Select Committee was unable to talk to several important participants in the failure investigation , and the P.R.C. refused to agree to the Select Committee 's request for interviews .
Additional controlled information may have been received by the P.R.C. The information and assistance conveyed by Loral and Hughes led to improvements to the guidance system of the P.R.C. 's Long March 3B rocket .
While the launch that failed was commercial , the information transmitted by Loral and Hughes was useful , as well , for military space launch purposes .
Loral and Hughes provided valuable additional information that exposed the P.R.C. to Western diagnostic processes that could lead to improvements in the reliability of all P.R.C. ballistic missiles .
Loral 's and Hughes ' advice could help reinforce or add vigor to the P.R.C. 's adherence to good design and test practices , which could be transferred to the ballistic missile program .
The exposure to U.S. diagnostic and test processes outlined by Loral and Hughes has the potential to improve P.R.C. and post-flight failure analysis for the ballistic missile program .
The technology transferred by Loral and Hughes thus has the potential , if used by the P.R.C. , to increase the reliability of future P.R.C. ballistic missiles .
The independent experts retained by the Select Committee had access not just to the written report prepared by Loral with input from Hughes , but also to the comments of participants about meetings in Beijing .
The independent experts conclude that information valuable to the P.R.C. 's space and ballistic missile programs was transferred .
Neither Loral nor Hughes disclosed to export control officers of the U.S. Government their unlicensed activities until after they were contacted by U.S. Government licensing officials demanding an explanation for their conduct .
The U.S. Government officials became aware of the improper activities through an article in a widely read industry publication .
This article also came to Loral 's attention prior to Loral 's disclosure to the U.S. Government .
Loral and Hughes had important commercial interests in the P.R.C. when they engaged in the 1996 failure investigation .
These interests included future sales of satellites to the P.R.C. or to parties serving the P.R.C. market , and reducing the cost and improving the safety of launching satellites in the P.R.C. E. In light of the P.R.C. 's aggressive espionage campaign against U.S. technology , it would be surprising if the P.R.C. has not exploited security lapses that have occurred in connection with launches of U.S. satellites in the P.R.C .
