That ominous high-pitched organ tremolo .
Greek temple ruins over blue Sicilian waters .
Yup , we know where we are .
We 're back in Godfather country .
This time it 's the Mafia world -LRB- oops , the world of `` tradition '' and `` honor '' -RRB- of Joseph Bonanno , the long-retired boss -LRB- he prefers `` father '' -RRB- widely known as Joe Bananas , who is now , at 94 , truly the Really Absolutely Very Last Don .
`` Bonanno : A Godfather 's Story , '' a two-part film being shown next Sunday and Monday on Showtime , may well be the highest-level mob memoir and tutorial -LRB- `` Mafia is a process , not a thing '' -RRB- to find its way to the screen .
It is quite certainly the only one ever to list another acknowledged Mafioso -- Bonanno 's son Salvatore , known as Bill -- as an executive producer .
And it is undoubtedly the first to tie strife in the Mafia 's ruling commission to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , as carried out , in this version anyway , by the Chicago Mafia boss Johnny Roselli hiding in a Dallas sewer facing the motorcade .
Yes , this purports to be factual -- Roselli 's supposed prison confidences to Bill Bonanno .
So does the picture of the Bonannos as guardians of rigorous Mafia family values , betrayed by `` a new generation of Americanized Mafia with a different set of values , blinded by the desire for money and power . ''
Bill Bonanno , 66 , who described himself in an interview as `` just a small farm boy from Arizona trying to make it in this business , '' said that he and the screenwriter , Thomas Michael Donnelly , `` worked as a team . ''
`` I told them I did n't want a whitewash , '' Bonanno said , speaking from his home in Tucson , where his father had sought refuge from the murderous vendettas that embroiled the New York Mafia clans in the 1960s .
`` I wanted the writer to write and Showtime to produce an accurate story . ''
Showtime says it did not want to `` censor '' the Bonannos .
`` This is what they say happened ; it does n't mean we 're endorsing it , '' said Jerry Offsay , president for programming at Showtime , speaking from Los Angeles .
Wherever possible , he said , researchers checked facts and at times Showtime insisted on the inclusion of unflattering material that the Bonannos might have preferred to skip over .
In the end , he said , `` Some of it is unverifiable but it sure is an interesting tale , and we are in the entertainment business , not documentarians . ''
It would hardly be the first time , of course , that fact and fiction have been interwoven on screen in the fanciful way , say , that Oliver Stone portrayed the Kennedy assassination as a vast government conspiracy reaching up to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson -LRB- depicted here as the Mafia 's dictated choice as Kennedy 's running mate -RRB- .
But it may be becoming increasingly common .
Books , too , are blurring the line , with reviewers failing all too often to flag the fiction in works of ostensible nonfiction .
Having spent a good part of the 1980s studying the Bonanno crime family for a book on the Sicilian - American heroin network known as the Pizza Connection , I was struck by the production 's creative and humanistic touches and presumably inadvertent humor .
`` What 's with these people ? '' the Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana rages against the ingrate Kennedys before the supposed mob hit on the president .
`` Do n't they have any sense of honor ? ''
Unfolding as a long flashback , the film traces Joseph Bonanno 's roots in Castellammare , Sicily ; his New York Mafia apprenticeship under the wily and grasping Salvatore Maranzano , whose 1931 murder opens the way for Bonanno 's elevation at 26 as the youngest boss ever , and the slow disintegration of his world under mob rivalries and the growing aggressiveness of federal authorities .
It ends with an abortive plot against fellow bosses and his withdrawal to Arizona , before damaging revelations link the Bonanno crime family to a vast traffic in narcotics .
Shot in the Castellammarese area of Sicily , Rome and Montreal -LRB- where Bill Bonanno was non grata to the Canadian authorities from his 1966 arrest in an unregistered car with fellow mobsters and guns -RRB- , the production stars Martin Landau as the aging don , Bruce Ramsay and Tony Nardi as his younger selves , and Edward James Olmos as Maranzano .
Michel Poulette directed .
Showtime 's partners included the Bonannos ' company Armeda Ltd. , along with Daniel L. Paulson Productions and Productions la Fete , which produced Showtime 's 1998 film of Armistead Maupin 's `` More Tales of the City . ''
The screenwriter , Donnelly , also wrote and directed `` The Garden of Redemption , '' a 1997 Showtime production set in a Nazi -occupied Italian village .
In case you 're wondering whatever happened to omerta , the so-called Mafia code of silence , Joseph Bonanno says : `` In my world , omerta is a noble principle .
It praises silence and scorns the informer .
Omerta is an injunction against allowing yourself to be used as the instrument of another man 's downfall .
Omerta , however , does not mean that a man cannot say what he feels . ''
And so , beginning more than 30 years ago , the Bonannos have been speaking out , if selectively .
First , in the mid-1960s , in the middle of a mob war , Bill Bonanno began confiding in a New York Times reporter , Gay Talese , whose resulting 1971 best seller , `` Honor Thy Father , '' centered on the younger Bonanno 's struggle to stay alive after his father was snatched off Park Avenue in 1964 in a suspicious disappearance on the eve of a date with a grand jury .
He reappeared just as mysteriously , unscathed , 19 months later .
Outraged by his son 's candor , Joseph Bonanno found an unusual way to retaliate : he published his own book , `` A Man of Honor , '' a 1983 autobiography written with Sergio Lalli .
Some reviewers found it sanctimonious , and even Michael Korda , his editor at Simon & Schuster at the time , calls it `` an exercise in caution , '' in his latest book , `` Another Life . ''
But the Bonanno book was forthcoming enough about the operations of the little-known 50-year -old ruling Mafia commission to excite the interest of an ambitious United States Attorney in Manhattan .
Taking it as his cue , as he later recounted , Rudolph W. Giuliani put together the first case against the commission and eight crime bosses and underlords accused of leading it , convicting all eight in 1986 .
Bonanno , long in retirement , was not in the dock , but he spent a year in jail on civil contempt in 1985 and 1986 for refusing to testify .
His only other prison time had come just a year before , in 1983 and 1984 , when a five-year sentence was cut to a year and a day after he was convicted of conspiring to thwart a grand jury investigation into money-laundering through businesses owned by his sons , Bill and Joseph Jr. Bill Bonanno himself spent 11 years in prison on various convictions .
This year it seemed the son 's turn to publish once again , and he came out with `` Bound by Honor : A Mafioso 's Story . ''
`` Most of the activity in any crew anywhere was legal , '' he contends .
The cash envelopes that the men kicked up to their chiefs and captains were strictly voluntary .
If a crew member did n't pay , there were no consequences .
`` The key , always , was the willing bond of loyalty . ''
Bill Bonanno also maintains that his father was shocked when one of his longtime group leaders , Carmine Galante , was charged with drug trafficking in 1962 : `` For us , this was the cruelest blow of all because it meant that trafficking had been occurring in our own Family for some time .
My father was heartbroken by this , although unwilling to do anything about it . ''
-LRB- No mention here of a meeting between Joseph Bonanno , Galante , Charles -LRB- Lucky -RRB- Luciano and a major Sicilian drug trafficker and Mafia leader , Gaetano Badalamenti , in Palermo in 1957 , a sit-down testified to by a leading Mafia turncoat , Tommaso Buscetta , in the Pizza Connection trial .
And no mention of all the Sicilian drug-runners the Bonanno mob slipped into the country , as later detailed by the FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone in his book and movie `` Donnie Brasco . '' -RRB-
The younger Bonanno also writes : `` Because I happened , at the time , to be the acting leader of the Bonanno ` crime family , ' I eventually learned who shot the president -- and why . ''
This turns out to be Roselli , supposedly exacting vengeance for what Mafia bosses viewed as a betrayal by Kennedy after they had swung crucial election support to him , only to become targets of Robert F. Kennedy 's anti-racketeering investigations .
`` I do n't need to allege -- I was there , '' said Bill Bonanno on the phone , claiming to have heard the story from a `` loose-lipped '' Roselli himself as they shared prison time at Terminal Island near Los Angeles in the early 1970s , not long before Roselli 's dismembered body was found in an oil drum in Biscayne Bay , Fla. Gerald Posner , author of the widely credited 1993 book `` Case Closed : Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK , '' called Roselli 's supposed account `` demonstrably false .
`` No bullets from the front hit ; that was clear from the evidence , '' he said .
Even Jim Garrison , the renegade New Orleans District Attorney , `` dropped a sewer shooter as physically impossible . ''
And , Posner said , Jack Ruby was unconnected to Giancana , so he could hardly have killed Oswald on Giancana 's orders , as Bill Bonanno also recounts .
The Showtime production , based on both Bonanno books , has young Joseph , son of a simpatico Mafia leader , hounded out of Sicily with other anti- Fascists by Mussolini 's Black Shirts .
Smuggled into Florida from Cuba , he seeks honest work , is rebuffed and drifts into bootlegging , supplying liquor on credit to a grateful speakeasy owner , played by Patti LuPone .
`` You got to be some kind of throwback to something I thought was extinct , '' she says adoringly .
He is at Maranzano 's side when they wage war against a vicious rival , Joe -LRB- the Boss -RRB- Massaria , who is lured to his death by Lucky Luciano .
Luciano in turn has Maranzano killed for supposedly plotting against him .
`` I turned a strong face to the world , '' Joseph Bonanno relates , `` but my heart was broken . ''
In real life he may have been more consolable , as his own book suggests .
In any case , he soon became boss himself .
Still , he says : `` My title of godfather did not exempt me from earning my own living .
Among the businesses I was fortunate to own were some in the garment district . ''
This enables him to give a job to the needy daughter of his old schoolteacher in Palermo .
But alas , intimidation and violence sometimes do rear their heads in the Mafia , as the film shows .
A factory owner is persuaded to put ghost employees on his payroll after a visit from the Bonannos .
A contractor agrees to withdraw his winning bid .
A numbers banker , so foolish as to skim from his Mafia superiors and then to ignore a banishment order , is entombed in cement .
And sometimes even the innocent must die .
`` Since when do we bother people outside our world ? ''
Joseph Bonanno scolds a deputy plotting the particularly heinous assassination of a crusading anti- Fascist journalist , Carlo Tresca , in 1943 .
`` You want this family to condone acting like common thugs ? ''
Yet Tresca is murdered .
`` It was the most difficult moment of my life as a godfather , '' he laments .
So difficult , apparently , that he could not even mention it , or Tresca , in his autobiography .
Nor does the movie suggest that the killing was widely attributed to Galante .
`` He was ashamed , '' Offsay of Showtime said .
`` It was a moment of great embarrassment . ''
This is a Joseph Bonanno who carries the heavy burden of history , yes , even the assassination of a president .
`` If the commission existed as Charlie Lucky and I had envisioned , '' he says , `` this tragedy might never have occurred . ''
