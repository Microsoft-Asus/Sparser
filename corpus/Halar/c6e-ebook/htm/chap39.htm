One part of a plant can send signals to other parts. For example, the terminal bud at the apex of a shoot is able to suppress the growth of axillary buds that may be many meters away. Plants keep track of the time of day and the time of year. They can sense gravity and the direction of light. For example, the grass seedling in the photograph on this page is growing toward light. A plant’s morphology and physiology are constantly tuned to its variable surroundings by complex interactions between environmental stimuli and internal signals</span>.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">This chapter focuses on how plants respond to these external and internal cues. At the</span> organismal <span class="Emphasis1">level, plants and animals respond to environmental stimuli by very different means. Animals, being mobile, respond mainly by behavioral mechanisms, moving toward positive stimuli and away from negative stimuli. Rooted to one location for life, a plant generally responds to environmental cues by adjusting its pattern of growth and development. For this reason, plants of the same species vary in body form much more than do animals of the same species. All lions have four limbs and approximately the same body proportions, but oak trees vary considerably in their number of limbs and their shapes. But at the</span> cellular <span class="Emphasis1">level, plants, animals, and all other eukaryotes are surprisingly similar in their signaling mechanisms. We begin our study of plant response with the role of signal transduction in plant cells</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
