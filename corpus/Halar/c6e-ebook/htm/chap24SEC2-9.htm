This interdisciplinary research is beginning to illuminate how slight genetic divergences can become magnified into major morphological differences between species. Genes that program development control the rate, timing, and spatial pattern of changes in an organism’s form as it is transfigured from a zygote into an adult.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The shape of an organism depends in part on the relative growth rates of its different parts during development. This proportioning that helps give a body its specific form is called <span class="Emphasis2">allometric growth</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">allos</span>, other, and <span class="Emphasis1">metron</span>, measure). <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.19a</span> tracks how allometric growth alters human body proportions during development. Change these relative rates of growth even slightly, and you change the adult form substantially. For example, different allometric patterns contribute to the contrasting shapes of human and chimpanzee skulls (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.19b</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig24-19','../fig/big/fig24-19.jpg','fig24-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig24-19.jpg" alt="fig24-19" name="myfig24-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 24-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Allometric growth.</span> Different growth rates for different parts of the body determine body proportions.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Evolution of morphology that arises by a modification in allometric growth is an example of <span class="Emphasis2">heterochrony,</span> which is evolutionary change in the rate or timing of developmental events. We can see another example of heterochrony in the evolution of salamander feet. Most salamanders are ground-dwelling, but some species live in trees. The feet of these tree-dwelling salamanders are adapted for climbing vertically rather than walking horizontally on the ground, with shorter digits and more webbing than the feet of ground-dwelling salamanders (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.20</span>). The basis for this adaptation was probably selection for mutant alleles of genes controlling the timing of foot development. According to this hypothesis, the foot of the ancestral salamander grew until the products of certain regulatory genes switched off growth, resulting in a foot of a certain size. A mutation in one or more of these regulatory genes could have switched off foot growth sooner, resulting in the stunted feet of tree-dwelling salamanders. In this way, a relatively small amount of genetic change can be amplified into the substantial morphological change that marks macroevolution.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig24-20','../fig/big/fig24-20.jpg','fig24-20');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig24-20.jpg" alt="fig24-20" name="myfig24-20"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 24-20.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Heterochrony and the evolution of salamander feet among closely related species.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Heterochrony can also change the timing of reproductive development relative to development of somatic (nonreproductive) organs. If the rate of reproductive development accelerates compared to somatic development, the sexually mature stage of a species may retain body features that were juvenile structures in an ancestral species. This is called <span class="Emphasis2">paedomorphosis</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">paedos</span>, child, and <span class="Emphasis1">morphosis</span>, formation). For example, most salamander species have a larval stage that undergoes metamorphosis to become an adult. But some species grow to adult size and become sexually mature while retaining gills and certain other larval features (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.21</span>). Such an evolutionary alteration of developmental timing can produce animals that appear very different from their ancestors, even though the overall genetic change may be small.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig24-21','../fig/big/fig24-21.jpg','fig24-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig24-21.jpg" alt="fig24-21" name="myfig24-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 24-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Paedomorphosis.</span> Some species retain as adults features that were juvenile in ancestors.

For example, genes called <span class="Emphasis2">homeotic</span> genes determine such basic features as where a pair of wings and a pair of legs will develop on a bird or how a plant’s flower parts are arranged (see Chapter 21).</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The products of one class of homeotic genes called <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> genes provide positional information in an animal embryo. This information about position prompts cells to develop into structures appropriate for a particular location. Changes in <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> genes can have a profound impact on morphology. Consider, for example, the evolution of tetrapods (the terrestrial vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) from fishes, which are aquatic vertebrates. One of the major transitions in this vertebrate history was the evolution of the walking legs of tetrapods from the fins of fishes. Unlike the fish fin, the tetrapod limb has digits (fingers and toes in humans) that extend skeletal support to the tip of the limb. During the development of a tetrapod, a <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> gene is expressed at the outer edge of the limb bud, the embryonic structure that develops into a leg. The product of this <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> gene apparently provides positional information about how far outward bones should grow in the limb (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.22</span>). A related <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> gene is expressed during the development of a fish fin, but in a smaller region back from the tip of the fin bud. A mutation in this <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> gene that expanded its region of expression to the tip of the bud probably contributed to the evolution of skeletal extensions that made it possible for limbs to support vertebrates on land. The evolution of vertebrates from invertebrate animals was an even bigger episode in macroevolution, and it, too, was probably associated with changes in <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> genes (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.23</span>, p. 480).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig24-22','../fig/big/fig24-22.jpg','fig24-22');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig24-22.jpg" alt="fig24-22" name="myfig24-22"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 24-22.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> genes and the evolution of tetrapod limbs.</span> The red zones in these diagrams of embryonic appendages indicate regions where a <span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> gene involved in skeleton development is expressed.</span></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig24-23','../fig/big/fig24-23.jpg','fig24-23');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig24-23.jpg" alt="fig24-23" name="myfig24-23"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 24-23.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Hox</span> mutations and the origin of vertebrates.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">In producing evolutionary novelties, changes in developmental dynamics, both temporal (heterochrony) and spatial, have undoubtedly played important roles in macroevolution.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
