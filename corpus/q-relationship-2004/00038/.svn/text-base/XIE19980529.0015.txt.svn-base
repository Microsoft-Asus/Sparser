SEOUL , May 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A nationwide labor strike to protest against mass lay-offs , which began Wednesday with an estimated 120,000 workers , is likely to deal a heavy blow to South Korea 's ailing economy .
The Hyundai Motor Co. and 54 other manufacturers , whose workers joined the strike , are facing daily losses of around 250 billion won -LRB- about 178.5 million U.S. dollars -RRB- .
The industrial action comes on top of a sharp drop in the nation 's credit standing in the international financial market and other invisible losses .
To add to the government 's worries , the strike will possibly scare away foreign investment , thus delaying economic restructuring , a condition tied to the International Monetary Fund 's 57 billion dollar loan after the country plunged into financial crisis late last year .
Some foreign banks have reportedly notified their South Korean borrowers that they will call in all maturing debts due to the growing economic instability caused by labor walkouts .
`` The current strike shows the beginning of more labor-management troubles , '' said Seoul -based Canadian business representative Frances Lee Smith .
`` Far more worrisome to foreigners are expected delays in the restructuring of -LRB- South -RRB- Korea 's debt-ridden conglomerates .
As a result of delayed restructuring , foreign investors will stop heading to -LRB- South -RRB- Korea . ''
Despite rising fears at home and abroad over the strike , the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions , sponsor of the strike , has said the walkout will proceed on Friday , and nationwide strikes will continue from June 3 through 10 until mass layoffs are stopped .
Meanwhile , President Kim Dae -jung and business leaders fear a further blow will be dealt by the devaluation of the Japanese yen , which comes at a time when South Korea concentrates on exporting its way out of the financial woes .
The yen plunged to 137 against the dollar in Tokyo on Monday for the first time since August 1991 .
The country 's major exports , such as electronics , semiconductors , steel , automobiles and petrochemical products , face fierce competition of Japanese goods .
A devalued Japanese yen will inevitably lead to weakened price competitiveness of South Korean products in global markets .
The Bank of Korea said the nation would see a loss of 1.5 billion dollars in trade annually with the Japanese yen maintaining 140 against the Greenback .
