SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- For most of the 1990s , the Daewoo conglomerate spread its wings , opening factories in Asia , the Middle East and eastern Europe .
The rapid expansion fit with the company 's name -- `` big universe '' in Korean .
But then Asia 's economic crisis hit , Daewoo 's sales plunged and it was crushed by a mountain of debt , leading some English -speaking Koreans to dub it `` Dae -woe . ''
Now the struggling conglomerate is being broken up by its creditors , and potential buyers are paying particular attention to Daewoo 's automotive operation and its access to Asia 's markets , which are starting to recover from their slump .
`` These markets are going to grow .
They 're good opportunities if you run your business well .
We need to get position in these markets , '' G. Richard Wagoner Jr. , president and CEO designate of General Motors Corp. , told reporters recently .
In an effort to recover at least some of the $ 82 billion owed by the conglomerate , banks are planning to auction off Daewoo 's 22 affiliates , which produce cars , trucks , ships , textiles and pesticides .
Daewoo Motor , South Korea 's second biggest automaker and the main engine for the conglomerate 's global expansion , was put on the block last week .
GM , which already has a foothold in Asia with partial ownership of Subaru , Isuzu and Suzuki , confirmed it would bid .
Ford Motor Co. , which controls Mazda 's operations , is considering the opportunity .
South Korean media said DaimlerChrysler , Fiat and Volkswagen also were interested , and Hyundai Motor , which has 70 percent of the South Korean car market with its sister Kia Motor , expressed interest in finding a foreign partner to make a joint bid .
Ford CEO Jac Nasser , in a meeting with journalists before the banks formally solicited bids , said his company would take a serious look at Daewoo , but would not buy just to block GM .
`` We 're not motivated to any great extent by what our competitors do .
I certainly would n't try to fit into our strategy an action that 's a spoiler action , '' Nasser said .
`` The questions are : ` Is the business equation right ?
Are the cultures right ? `` `
If Ford won the bidding for Daewoo , it could challenge GM for world leadership in automaking .
GM now sells more than 8 million vehicles around the world each year , while Ford 's sales are just under 7 million .
Daewoo Motor 's 17 factories produced 758,500 cars and trucks in 1999 .
On the surface , Daewoo Motor does n't seem a good buy -- its debt stands at $ 16.3 billion .
But acquiring it would give access to the closed auto market in South Korea , where buying a domestic car is often synonymous with patriotism .
Only about 2,300 imported cars were among the 910,000 automobiles bought here last year .
The Daewoo assembly lines on South Korea 's west coast also are the country 's most modern and cost-efficient , and would provide a foreign owner with a stepping stone into China 's big market .
Daewoo Motor has factories in China , too , and a dozen other countries , including India , Vietnam , Iran , Uzbekistan , Poland and Romania .
It sold 187,039 cars and trucks in Poland last year , surpassing Fiat to become the No. 1 carmaker there .
The dismantling of the Daewoo conglomerate marks a shift for South Korea , a poor agrarian country that developed one of the world 's biggest economies by nurturing a few core industries with cheap credit and protection against foreign competitors .
Those policies encouraged Daewoo on its fateful overexpansion into developing countries and former communist states , paying for it mostly with borrowed money .
The corporate empire all but collapsed after Asia 's currency crisis began in July 1997 , causing slides in consumer buying across the region and leaving Daewoo short of cash to pay off short-term loans .
Creditor banks say they will select one or two bidders for Daewoo Motor by May and hope to close a deal two to three months later .
Whatever the outcome , South Korea 's car market is being opened up to foreign participation .
The French carmaker Renault already is negotiating to take over Samsung Motors , which is in court receivership , and President Kim Dae -jung says foreign investment is the only way to sustain the economy 's rebound .
Many consumers are welcoming the changes , hoping domestic automakers will be pressured into bringing prices down and improving their products .
`` Now it 's time for them to face and survive the real competition , and for us to have new choices , '' said Kim Bae -ho , one of Seoul 's 70,000 taxi drivers .
