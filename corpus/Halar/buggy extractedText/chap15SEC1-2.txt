SEX CHROMOSOMES

 

 The chromosomal basis of sex varies with the organism



 

 Sex-linked genes have unique patterns of inheritance



You learned earlier that Morgan's discovery of a sex-linked trait (white eyes) was a key episode in the development of a chromosome theory of inheritance. In this section, we consider the role of sex chromosomes in inheritance in more detail. We begin by reviewing the genetics of sex in humans and comparing it with sex determination in some other animals.
