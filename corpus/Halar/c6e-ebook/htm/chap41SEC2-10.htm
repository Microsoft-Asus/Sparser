Most of the enzymatic hydrolysis of food macromolecules and most of the absorption of nutrients into the blood occurs in the small intestine.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The first 25 cm or so of the small intestine is called the <span class="Emphasis2">duodenum.</span> It is here that acid chyme from the stomach mixes with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and gland cells of the intestinal wall itself (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.16</span>). The pancreas produces several hydrolytic enzymes and an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate. The bicarbonate acts as a buffer, offsetting the acidity of chyme from the stomach.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig41-16','../fig/big/fig41-16.jpg','fig41-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig41-16.jpg" alt="fig41-16" name="myfig41-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 41-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The duodenum.</span> As peristalsis squeezes the mixture of digestive juices and partially-digested food along the small intestine, hydrolytic enzymes break the food molecules down to monomers.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The liver performs a wide variety of important functions in the body, including the production of <span class="Emphasis2">bile,</span> a mixture of substances that is stored in the gallbladder until needed. Bile contains no digestive enzymes, but it does contain bile salts, which act as detergents that aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile also contains pigments that are by-products of red blood cell destruction in the liver; these bile pigments are eliminated from the body with the feces.</p><p class="Header3">Enzymatic Action in the Small Intestine</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s now follow the action of enzymes from the pancreas and intestinal (duodenal) wall in digesting macromolecules.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Carbohydrate Digestion.</span> The digestion of starch and glycogen begun by salivary amylase in the oral cavity continues in the small intestine (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.17</span>, p. 864). Pancreatic amylases hydrolyze starch, glycogen, and smaller polysaccharides into disaccharides. The enzyme maltase completes the digestion of maltose, splitting it into two molecules of the simple sugar glucose. Maltase is one of a family of disaccharidases, each one specific for hydrolysis of a different disaccharide. Sucrase, for instance, hydrolyzes table sugar (sucrose), and lactase digests lactose, a sugar found in milk (adults usually have much less lactase and therefore less ability to digest milk sugar than children have). The disaccharidases are built into the membranes and extracellular matrix covering the intestinal epithelium, which is also the site of sugar absorption. Thus, the terminal steps in carbohydrate digestion--the steps that yield energy-rich monomers--occur where these monomers are absorbed into the blood.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig41-17','../fig/big/fig41-17.jpg','fig41-17');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig41-17.jpg" alt="fig41-17" name="myfig41-17"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 41-17.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Enzymatic digestion in the human digestive system.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Protein Digestion.</span> Digestion of proteins in the small intestine completes the process begun by pepsin in the stomach (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.17b</span>). Several enzymes in the duodenum dismantle polypeptides into their component amino acids or into small peptides that in turn are attacked by other enzymes. <span class="Emphasis2">Trypsin</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">chymotrypsin</span> are specific for peptide bonds adjacent to certain amino acids, and thus, like pepsin, break large polypeptides into shorter chains. Enzymes called <span class="Emphasis2">dipeptidases,</span> attached to the intestinal lining, split small peptides. <span class="Emphasis2">Carboxypeptidase</span> splits off one amino acid at a time, beginning at the end of the polypeptide that has a free carboxyl group. <span class="Emphasis2">Aminopeptidase</span> works in the opposite direction. Either aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase alone could eventually completely digest a protein, but the teamwork among the various enzymes speeds up hydrolysis tremendously.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Many of the protein-digesting enzymes, such as aminopeptidase, are secreted by the intestinal epithelium, but trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase are secreted in inactive forms by the pancreas.

A team of enzymes called <span class="Emphasis2">nucleases</span> hydrolyze DNA and RNA into their component nucleotides (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.17c</span>). Other hydrolytic enzymes then break nucleotides down further into nucleosides, nitrogenous bases, sugars, and phosphates.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Fat Digestion.</span> Nearly all the fat in a meal reaches the small intestine completely undigested. Hydrolysis of fats is a special problem, because fat molecules are insoluble in water. However, bile salts from the gallbladder secreted into the duodenum coat tiny fat droplets and keep them from coalescing, a process called <span class="Emphasis2">emulsification.</span> Because the droplets are small, a large surface area of fat is exposed to <span class="Emphasis2">lipase,</span> an enzyme that hydrolyzes the fat molecules (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.17d</span>).</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Thus, the macromolecules from food are completely hydrolyzed to their component monomers as peristalsis moves the mixture of chyme and digestive juices along the small intestine. Most digestion is completed early in this journey, while the chyme is still in the duodenum. The remaining regions of the small intestine, the <span class="Emphasis2">jejunum</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">ileum,</span> function mainly in the absorption of nutrients and water.</p><p class="Header3">Absorption of Nutrients</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">To enter the body, nutrients in the lumen must cross the lining of the digestive tract. A few nutrients are absorbed in the stomach and large intestine, but most absorption occurs in the small intestine. This organ has a huge surface area--300 m<SUP>2</SUP>, roughly the size of a tennis court. Large circular folds in the lining bear fingerlike projections called <span class="Emphasis2">villi,</span> and each epithelial cell of a villus has many microscopic appendages called <span class="Emphasis2">microvilli</span> that are exposed to the intestinal lumen. This enormous microvillar surface is an adaptation that greatly increases the rate of nutrient absorption (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.19</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig41-19','../fig/big/fig41-19.jpg','fig41-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig41-19.jpg" alt="fig41-19" name="myfig41-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 41-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The structure of the small intestine.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">Penetrating the core of each villus is a net of microscopic blood vessels (capillaries) and a small vessel of the lymphatic system called a <span class="Emphasis2">lacteal.</span> (In addition to their circulatory system, vertebrates have an associated network of vessels--the lymphatic system--that carries a clear fluid called lymph, discussed in Chapter 43.) Nutrients are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium and then across the unicellular epithelium of the capillaries or lacteals. Only these two single layers of epithelial cells separate nutrients in the lumen of the intestine from the bloodstream.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">In some cases, transport of nutrients across the epithelial cells is passive. The simple sugar fructose, for example, apparently moves by diffusion down its concentration gradient from the lumen of the intestine into the epithelial cells, and then into capillaries. Other nutrients, including amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and glucose and several other simple sugars, are pumped against concentration gradients by the epithelial membranes. This active transport allows the intestine to absorb a much higher proportion of the nutrients in the intestine than would be possible with passive diffusion.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">Amino acids and sugars pass through the epithelium, enter capillaries, and are carried away from the intestine by the bloodstream. After glycerol and fatty acids are absorbed by epithelial cells, they are recombined into fats within those cells. The fats are then mixed with cholesterol and coated with special proteins, forming small globules called <span class="Emphasis2">chylomicrons,</span> most of which are transported by exocytosis out of the epithelial cells and into lacteals. The lacteals converge into the larger vessels of the lymphatic system. Lymph, containing chylomicrons, eventually drains from the lymphatic system into large veins that return blood to the heart.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">In contrast to the lacteals, the capillaries and veins that drain the nutrients away from the villi all converge into the <span class="Emphasis2">hepatic portal vessel,</span> which leads directly to the liver. This ensures that the liver--which has the metabolic versatility to interconvert various organic molecules--has first access to amino acids and sugars absorbed after a meal is digested. There fore, blood that leaves the liver may have a very different balance of these nutrients than the blood that entered via the hepatic portal vessel. For example, the liver helps regulate the level of glucose molecules in the blood, and blood exiting the liver usually has a glucose concentration very close to 0.1% , regardless of the carbohydrate content of a meal (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.1</span>). From the liver, blood travels to the heart, which pumps the blood and the nutrients it contains to all parts of the body.</p><p class="Header3">Digestive Efficiency and Cost</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">The digestive and absorptive processes are very effective in obtaining energy and nutrients. People eating the typical diets consumed in developed countries usually absorb 80 to 90 percent of the organic matter in their food. Much of the remaining undigestible material is cellulose from plant cell walls, and thus diets containing lots of fresh vegetables are not absorbed as completely as diets that are rich in meats, fats, or simple carbohydrates.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText">Because digestion and absorption depend on such active mechanisms as peristalsis, enzyme secretion, and active transport, there is a substantial energy cost to processing food. Depending on the animal species and the diet, digesting and absorbing a meal may require the animal to expend an amount of energy equal to between 3%  and 30%  of the chemical energy contained in the meal.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
