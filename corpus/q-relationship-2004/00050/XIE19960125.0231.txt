At a meeting of the defense minister and other top-ranking commanders , Bedoya said that in accordance with the Constitution , the army had the obligation to back the institution of the president during the current crisis .
Answering questions on the RCN radio station about whether the army backs the institution rather than the individual , Bedoya said : `` We are backing the institution and the institution of the president because that is stipulated in the Constitution and we understand that no matter what the situation , it must be resolved legally and constitutionally . ''
He said that in Colombia , there could not be a power vacuum and that was why the armed forces backed political institutions .
`` What is important is that a rule of law exists in Colombia with constitutional rules that work and should continue to work , '' he said .
Bedoya declined to express a personal opinion about the political crisis stemming from explosive accusations made by former Defense Minister Fernando Botero against Colombian President Ernesto Samper .
Botero alleged Monday that Samper knowingly accepted money from the Cali drug cartel to finance his 1994 election campaign .
Samper has called the allegations `` monstrous '' and rejected calls for his resignation .
The military chief said that , according to the Constitution , the armed forces must not be involved in politics .
He added that the meeting held in the Defense Ministry was in no way related to the political crisis as it was scheduled a few days ago .
