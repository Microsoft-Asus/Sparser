Phytochromes regulate many of a plant’s responses to light throughout its life from seed to flower. Let’s look at a couple of examples.</p><p class="Header3">The Phytochrome Switch and Seed Germination</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">It was studies of seed germination that led to the discovery of phytochromes. Because of their limited food reserves, the successful sprouting of many types of small seeds, such as lettuce, requires that they germinate only when conditions, especially the light environment, are near optimal. Such seeds often remain dormant for many years until a change in light conditions. For example, the death of a shading tree or the plowing of a field may create a favorable light environment for germination.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">In the 1930s, scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture determined the action spectrum for light-induced germination of lettuce seeds. They exposed water-swollen seeds to a few minutes of monochromatic (single-colored) light of various wavelengths and then stored the seeds in the dark. After two days, the researchers scored the number of seeds that had germinated under each light regimen. The action spectrum revealed that red light of 660 nm wavelength increases the germination percentage of lettuce seeds the most compared to control seeds that had not been exposed to any light. In marked contrast, far-red light, that is light of wavelengths just near the edge of human visibility (730 nm), <span class="Emphasis1">inhibits</span> lettuce seed germination compared to the dark controls. What happens when the lettuce seeds are subjected to a flash of red (R) light followed by a flash of far-red (FR) light or, conversely, to FR light followed by R light? The answer is that the <span class="Emphasis1">last</span> flash of light determines the seeds’ response (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.18</span>). In other words, the effects of red and far-red light are reversible.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-18','../fig/big/fig39-18.jpg','fig39-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-18.jpg" alt="fig39-18" name="myfig39-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Phytochrome regulation of lettuce seed germination.</span> The control seeds, on the left, were kept in the dark.

It consists of a protein covalently bonded to a nonprotein part that functions as a chromophore, the light-absorbing part of the molecule (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.19</span>). So far, researchers have identified five different phytochromes in <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span>, each with a slightly different protein component.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-19','../fig/big/fig39-19.jpg','fig39-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-19.jpg" alt="fig39-19" name="myfig39-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Structure of a phytochrome.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The chromophore of a phytochrome reverts back and forth between two isomeric forms (see Chapter 4 to review isomers).

P<SUB>fr</SUB> is the form of phytochrome that triggers many of a plant’s developmental responses to light. For example, in the seed germination experiments we just described, P<SUB>r</SUB> in the lettuce seeds that were exposed to red light was converted to P<SUB>fr</SUB>, stimulating the cellular responses that lead to germination. When the red-illuminated seeds were then exposed to far-red light, the P<SUB>fr</SUB> was converted back to P<SUB>r</SUB>, inhibiting the germination response.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig39-20','../fig/big/fig39-20.jpg','fig39-20');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig39-20.jpg" alt="fig39-20" name="myfig39-20"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 39-20.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Phytochrome: a molecular switching mechanism.</span> Absorption of red light causes the bluish P<SUB>r</SUB> to change to the blue-greenish P<SUB>fr</SUB>.

Plants synthesize phytochrome as P<SUB>r</SUB>, and if seeds are kept in the dark the pigment remains almost entirely in the P<SUB>r</SUB> form (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 39.20</span>). But if the seeds are illuminated with sunlight, the phytochrome is exposed to red light (along with all the other wavelengths in sunlight), and much of the P<SUB>r</SUB> is converted to P<SUB>fr</SUB>. This appearance of P<SUB>fr</SUB> is one of the ways that plants detect sunlight. When seeds are exposed to adequate sunlight for the first time, it is the appearance of P<SUB>fr</SUB> that triggers their germination.</p><p class="Header3">The Phytochrome Switch and Shade Avoidance</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">The phytochrome system also provides the plant with information about the <span class="Emphasis1">quality</span> of light. Sunlight includes both red and far-red radiation. Thus, during the day the P<SUB>r</SUB><img align="middle" src="../img/sym/rlarrow2.gif"> P<SUB>fr</SUB> photoreversion reaches a dynamic equilibrium, with the ratio of the two phytochrome forms indicating the relative amounts of red and far-red light. This sensing mechanism enables plants to adapt to changes in light conditions. Consider, for example, the "shade-avoidance" response of a tree that requires relatively high light intensity. If other trees in a forest shade this tree, the phytochrome ratio shifts in favor of P<SUB>r</SUB> because the forest canopy screens out more red light than far-red light. (This is because the chlorophyll pigments in the leaves of the canopy absorb red light and allow far-red light to pass.) This shift in the ratio of red to far-red light induces the tree to allocate more of its resources to growing taller. In contrast, direct sunlight increases the proportion of P<SUB>fr</SUB>, which stimulates branching and inhibits vertical growth.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">In addition to enabling plants to detect light and distinguish its quality, phytochromes also function in a plant’s ability to keep track of the passage of days and seasons. To understand phytochrome’s role in these timekeeping processes, we must first examine the clock itself.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
