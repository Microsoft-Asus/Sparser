OSLO , Norway --
In what diplomats say is the first endeavor of its kind , the United States and 20 other countries will meet here Monday to try to stop the spread of assault rifles , pistols , hand grenades , mortars and other so-called light weapons .
The conference reflects a growing realization among governments that in the post-cold-war world it is not the jets and tanks but the small arms that are the prime contributors to regional instability , fueling nationalistic and ethnic wars where the casualties have been in the tens of thousands .
`` This is the first governmental conference that will try to map out the actions to be taken to curb the proliferation of small arms , '' said Helga Hernes , a senior official in the Norwegian Foreign Ministry , which has brought the governments together .
`` This is the disarmament issue of the ' 90s . ''
She said that many nongovernmental organizations , buoyed by their successful effort to outlaw land mines , have begun a campaign for controls on light weapons .
But beneath a surface agreement on the seriousness of the problem lurk serious disagreements on what to do .
The Clinton administration , anxious not to run afoul of the gun lobby or the Pentagon , was initially reluctant to attend the conference and wants to proceed slowly , preferring a sharing of information here over plans for action , several U.S. officials in Washington said .
Above all , the administration is determined to avoid a repeat of the land-mines campaign -- `` the Madison Avenue approach , '' as U.S. officials refer to it , meaning a public-relations blitz with images of victims .
While most governments supported the land-mine agreement , the Clinton administration fought the ban and will not sign the treaty .
In the light-weapons arena , one of the contentious issues is whether governments should concentrate on illicit trafficking , which is what the Clinton administration wants to do , or should address the legal trade as well .
Many governments , as well as many U.S. officials , consider controlling the legal trade crucial to keeping weapons out of regions of conflict and the hands of dictators .
While the United States may not want immediate action , other countries certainly do , notably Belgium , Canada and Norway .
Canada plans on Monday to propose an international treaty that would restrict legal , as well as illicit , arms sales , Canadian officials said .
It would be the first international instrument addressing the spread of small arms .
`` Canada is hoping that something more will come out of this other than just a recognition of the scope of the problem , that at least it will mark the beginning of an action plan , '' said Eric Hoskins , a senior adviser to Canada 's Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy .
Describing measures to control the spread of small arms as `` an idea whose time has come , '' Hoskins called the Oslo conference , which is to last two days , `` a watershed . ''
Axworthy gave the movement considerable impetus when on the eve of the signing of the land-mines ban he declared that it was now time to tackle small arms .
`` All too often it is small arms , rather than the weapons systems targeted by disarmament efforts , that cause the greatest bloodshed , '' Axworthy said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly last October .
The world 's governments have adopted many treaties and agreements to control the spread of conventional weapons , from combat helicopters to ships and missiles , and the development of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
But no treaty or comprehensive monitoring system exists for small arms or light weapons .
These are generally defined as weapons that can be carried by an individual , or fired by a small crew , including automatic rifles , submachine guns , rocket-propelled grenade launchers , small mortars and shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles .
Light and easy to use , these weapons have killed hundreds of thousands of people , often women and children , in Bosnia , Somalia , Rwanda , the Sudan , Algeria , Afghanistan and Sri Lanka .
They have also been used to arm child soldiers .
About a third of the small-arms trade is `` illicit , '' meaning that the supplier violates some law -- for example , preparing false shipping documents to disguise the true destination -- and risks going to jail if caught , said Michael Klare , a pioneer in research on the small-arms trade and a professor at Hampshire College , in Massachusetts .
In seeking to limit the conference 's focus to the illicit trade , the United States is backed by France , which is expected to attend the meeting , as well as China and Russia , which are not attending .
Other countries here include Mali , which has proposed a moratorium on weapons sales into west Africa ; South Africa , which is awash in assault rifles that poured into the country after wars in neighboring states , and Colombia , which is searching for ways to stop the flow of rifles and pistols to rebel groups and drug gangs .
Advocates of tackling the legal trade as well argue that unless governments do so it will be impossible to deal effectively with the illicit trade because the two are inextricably linked .
`` We know for a fact from our research that a lot of the weapons sold legally get into the illegal trade , '' said an U.S. official .
Another U.S. official said , `` If this conference focuses only on the illicit trade , that will do very little -- in fact , it will do nothing -- to reduce the pool of weaponry that kills most people . ''
U.S. officials in Washington and Europe who were willing to talk about the meeting would do so only on the condition that they not be identified .
They said a State Department official who had spoken publicly of the need for controls on small arms had been reprimanded by the White House .
Steps to curb the spread of small arms include codes of conduct that would obligate producing countries , such as the United States , France , Britain , China and Russia , not to sell to governments with poor human rights records or to regions where there are conflicts .
There is also a need for `` greater transparency , '' said Ms. Hernes , the Norwegian Foreign Ministry official .
She said governments should report their small-arms sales and purchases , as they do now for heavy weapons , and this information should be published .
`` What we are underlining with this meeting , '' she said , `` is that you have to get governments to do something about small arms . ''
