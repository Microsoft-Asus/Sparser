While administration officials agreed that Clinton 's visit helped ease some tensions , neither country has signaled that it intends to halt development of the arsenals the two countries revealed to the world by exploding nuclear devices in quick succession in 1998 .
India continues to see its nuclear arsenal as necessary for its status as an emerging power and to deter not only Pakistan but also neighboring China , a Pakistani ally .
Pakistan , less populous and poorer than India , sees its nuclear force as essential to counterbalance its rival 's larger conventional forces .
Additionally , analysts have warned that if American plans for a missile defense prompt China to build up its nuclear arsenal , still more momentum will be added to the arms race across the region .
While the president 's visit has not prompted New Delhi or Islamabad to scale back their nuclear programs , many experts say the trip and subsequent administration diplomacy have helped to nurture other positive political developments .
India has released some political prisoners related to Pakistani -backed militant groups in Kashmir , and last month one of the most important of those groups , the Hizbul Mujahedeen , declared a unilateral three-month cease-fire .
The group opened talks with India on Friday .
But diplomats and other experts still see the chances of a lasting breakthrough as low , and violence has continued in Kashmir .
Given the Kashmir dispute , diplomats and arms control experts see nuclear weapons on the subcontinent as particularly dangerous .
India and Pakistan , unlike other nuclear powers -- for example , the United States and Russia -- share a common border , have had no sustained dialogue and lack even a framework to hold serious negotiations .
After Pakistan moved into Kargil , Pakistan 's rhetoric grew increasingly harsh and India prepared to mobilize a significant force that could have led to a dramatic escalation , experts say .
`` Kargil proved that having nuclear weapons would not deter new conflicts , '' Perkovich said .
`` It also showed that unless such conflicts themselves were prevented , the possibility of an accidental or deliberate nuclear exchange would also increase given both states ' relatively poor systems of intelligence surveillance and nuclear command and control . ''
While neither private experts nor the American government has firm estimates of the size of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals , Perkovich estimates that India has produced enough plutonium for 60 weapons .
But he said he believed that India had far fewer actual bombs , `` in the neighborhood of 35 weapons . ''
In the event of a nuclear war , these would be delivered by aircraft .
Pakistan has enough highly enriched uranium for roughly the same number of bombs , he added , and it could deliver them by a combination of bombers and missiles .
Stephen P. Cohen , a South Asian policy scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington , called the risk of nuclear conflict `` serious '' and `` increasing . ''
But the president 's trip , he said , had succeeded in engaging Washington in the region , a development that was particularly important to India , which has long desired to be seen as an Asian power .
`` The president should have gone much earlier , '' he said .
Robert Oakley , a former ambassador to Pakistan , said that Washington may have inadvertently helped fuel Pakistan 's nuclear ambitions and reduced American leverage over Islamabad by failing to resume economic and military assistance to Pakistan that Congress cut off in 1990 because of the Pakistani nuclear program .
Experts and diplomats said Clinton had been determined to visit India after Hillary Clinton , the first lady , and their daughter , Chelsea , toured the country in 1995 , and when he finally went , in March , the trip was billed as a `` war prevention trip , '' according to one participant in the intelligence assessment , which was begun with the two-month Kargil conflict that ended the previous July .
`` Since the intelligence report concluded that the region demanded high-level attention to defuse tensions and prevent the outbreak of conflicts that could escalate , the politics of the trip dovetailed perfectly with the intelligence assessment , '' he said .
During his visit , in an address to the Indian Parliament , Clinton appealed to the `` great nation of India '' to give up its nuclear arsenal , and he urged India to take the lead in starting a dialogue with Pakistan .
Progress toward such a dialogue seemed to be building with a meeting of the two countries ' prime ministers on their border in early 1999 .
But after the Kargil incursion , which came just months later , India 's leadership felt betrayed .
Since Kargil , Pakistan 's civilian government was overthrown in a military coup last October .
Clinton met briefly with the leader , Gen. Musharraf , after his much longer visit to India , but made no headway on a range of American concerns , including when Pakistan would return to democratic government .
Pakistan continues to maintain that it will not scale back its nuclear program unless India does so first .
While India has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict in the region , it has made clear that it will respond if attacked .
Indian officials brushed aside efforts by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to persuade them to join international talks aimed at ending the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons .
And Prime Minister Vajpayee has steadfastly refused to renounce the country 's nuclear arsenal , though he has pledged not to conduct further nuclear tests .
