GENEVA , May 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- Monday called for West African countries to open their door to thousands of new Liberian refugees fleeing fighting in Liberian capital Monrovia .
The UN agency in charge of refugee issues made the appeal after it repeatedly failed to make Liberia 's neighbouring countries allow some 4,300 Liberian people aboard ships to go on shore .
UNHCR said the Nigerian freighter Bulk Challege was still looking for a port to disembark the some 3,600 people aboard who had been rejected by Cote d 'Ivoire and Ghana , and the Victory Reefer was off Sierra Leone which had denied its 700 passengers landing .
High commissioner Sadako Ogata voiced concern about the situation of these people who have been at sea for some days , saying `` The situation has become desperate .
Unless the door is opened to them , a lot of people , many of them women and children , may die . ''
She appealed for continued generosity of countries in the region to grant asylum to the newly-made Liberian refugees , adding that UNHCR was prepared to help the countries doing so in full complaince with internationally accepted humanitarian standards .
Currently , there are more than 750,000 Liberian refugees in West Africa , 410,000 of them in Guinea , 305,000 in Cote d 'Ivoire , 15,000 in Ghana , 4,700 in Sierra Leone and 4,000 in Nigeria .
