BAGHDAD , Iraq
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
President Saddam Hussein whose country was stripped of a potential to build nuclear weapons said Tuesday that India and Pakistan have the right to possess nuclear bombs .
In a message to the leaders of the two countries , Saddam said he saw no reason why the nuclear tests conducted by the two countries last month should spark an international outcry .
`` We see that both India and Pakistan had acted in accordance with the right of sovereignty , '' Saddam said in his almost identical messages , carried by the official Iraqi News Agency .
`` We see no justification for the mounting of the campaign against India and Pakistan , '' Saddam said .
INA said Saddam made the remarks in response to letters Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India sent to him , explaining the reasons why they decided to detonate nuclear devices .
Saddam said any criticism of the explosion is part of `` the double standards policy '' that the United States and Britain pursue to deny others what they already have .
`` If they want to have a world free of nuclear weapons , and this is what we support and call for , then this has to be applied to all countries without exception , '' Saddam said .
He also criticized the United Nations for not acting on Israel , which is believed to possess a large nuclear arsenal .
Iraq was suspected to be about one year away from producing the nuclear bomb when U.N. arms monitors dismantled the program over seven years under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms .
Iraq maintains that its program was for peaceful purposes .
