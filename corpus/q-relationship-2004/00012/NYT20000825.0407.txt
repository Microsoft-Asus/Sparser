The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday , Aug. 26 : As flying becomes safer , crashes become harder to explain .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">That has been the paradox hovering over the investigation of the TWA Flight 800 disaster .
In the immediate aftermath of the crash , which killed all 230 people on board , there were theories that the plane had been brought down by terrorists or an errant missile .</ENAMEX>
Now , after one of the most painstaking investigations in the history of aviation , the National Transportation Safety Board has ruled out those possibilities .
Instead , the board determined that a `` fuel/air explosion inside the center wing tank '' was the probable cause of the Boeing 747 's breaking up in midair off Long Island , N.Y. , 12 minutes into its flight from Kennedy Airport to Paris on July 17 , 1996 .
What is not known for certain is what ignited the explosion , though a short circuit in electrical wiring is strongly suspected .
The only wiring inside fuel tanks consists of low-voltage wires for fuel gauges .
A short circuit there is deemed unlikely .
But inspectors believe that a short circuit in wiring outside the tank may have led to a surge of current in the wiring inside , providing the spark .
In the absence of certainty , the Federal Aviation Administration has drafted three dozen airworthiness directives on fuel tank safety that seek to address each possible ignition and explosion source .
One approach is to make a jet 's fuel tanks less flammable .
The fuel in an aircraft 's center wing tank is flammable roughly a third of the time , when the combination of air , fuel vapors and temperature is just so .
The FAA says that `` nitrogen inerting '' technology has been rapidly developed as a result of the crash .
This technology should soon enable airlines to replace the air in gas tanks with inert gas before takeoff , significantly reducing the amount of time the center wing tank 's fuel is flammable .
The other approach is to eliminate possible sparks .
Here the FAA has focused on worn wiring .
TWA Flight 800 will also be remembered for its impact on the way victims ' families are treated in the aftermath of an air crash .
Reacting to the families ' plight , Congress passed legislation requiring that airlines act more efficiently and more humanely in providing them assistance and information .
But the most fitting way for government and industry to honor the dead is through steps designed to prevent a similar disaster in the future .
