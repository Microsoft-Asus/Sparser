Essential nutrients must be supplied in preassembled form. Essential amino acids are those an animal cannot make. Essential fatty acids are unsaturated.

Substrate-feeders tunnel through their food, eating as they go. Fluid-feeders suck nutrient-rich fluids from a living host. Most animals are bulk-feeders, eating relatively large pieces of food.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">OVERVIEW OF FOOD PROCESSING</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The four main stages of food processing are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination (pp. 857-858)</span> Food processing in animals involves ingestion (the act of eating), digestion (enzymatic breakdown of the macromolecules of food into their monomers), absorption (the uptake of nutrients by body cells), and elimination (the passage of undigested materials out of the body in feces).</p></LI><LI><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Digestion occurs in specialized compartments (pp. 858-859,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 41.10</span>-<span class="SmallCap">41.12</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> In intracellular digestion, food particles are engulfed by endocytosis and digested within food vacuoles. Most animals use extracellular digestion, with enzymatic hydrolysis occurring outside cells in a gastrovascular cavity or alimentary canal.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">THE MAMMALIAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus initiate food processing (pp. 860-861,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 41.13</span> and <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 41.14</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Food is lubricated and digestion begins in the oral cavity, where teeth chew food into smaller particles that are exposed to salivary amylase, initiating the breakdown of glucose polymers. The pharynx is the intersection leading to the trachea and the esophagus. The esophagus conducts food from the pharynx to the stomach by involuntary peristaltic waves.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The stomach stores food and performs preliminary digestion (pp. 861-863,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 41.15</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The stomach stores food and secretes gastric juice, which converts a meal to acid chyme. Gastric juice includes hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin.</p></LI><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The small intestine is the major organ of digestion and absorption (pp. 863-866,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 41.16</span>-<span class="SmallCap">41.19</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Acid chyme from the stomach mixes in the duodenum with intestinal juice, bile, and pancreatic juice. Diverse enzymes complete the hydrolysis of food molecules to monomers, which are absorbed into the blood across the lining of the small intestine.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity41A:<span class="Emphasis1">
