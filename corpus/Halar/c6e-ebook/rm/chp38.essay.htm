									<a name="para92"></a><p class="BlockText">With the self-incompatibility gene system in mind, review the ways that evolutionary forces can preserve variation in a population. Which evolutionary force is acting in the self-incompatibility system? The S-alleles are one of the most polymorphic and rapidly evolving gene systems in plants. Think of an evolutionary hypothesis to explain this fact.</p>

									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">In September 2001, Mexican government scientists announced with alarm that previously pristine populations of native maize varieties in remote regions of Mexico had been contaminated with genes from genetically engineered corn plants, despite the fact that commercial planting of engineered corn is illegal in Mexico. This discovery has raised new questions about how rapidly transgenes might move into natural populations by gene flow and hybridization. If you wanted to develop measures to ensure that engineered crops could not cross with wild relatives, what approaches might you employ? Why would your approach depend on whether a crop is harvested for a vegetative structure versus a fruit?</p>

									<a name="para98"></a><p class="BlockText">Humans have engaged in genetic manipulation for millennia, producing many plant and animal varieties through selective breeding and hybridization processes that can modify the genomes of organisms on a significant level. Why do you think modern genetic engineering, which often entails introducing or modifying only one or a few genes, has met with so much public opposition? Should some forms of genetic engineering be of greater concern than others? If so, what forms, and why?</p>
