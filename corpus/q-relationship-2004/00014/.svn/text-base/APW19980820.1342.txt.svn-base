U.S. strikes on terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan complied with international law and the rights of states to self-defense under the U.N. charter , Washington told the Security Council .
In a letter Thursday to the council president , Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the military strikes , saying repeated threats by Osama Bin Laden 's terrorist organization left Washington `` no choice but to use armed force to prevent these attacks from continuing . ''
He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter , which states that nothing `` shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations . ''
The article requires member states report any such actions to the Security Council .
President Bill Clinton said U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , which killed over 250 people .
`` The targets struck , and the timing and method of attack used , were carefully designed to minimize risks of collateral damage to civilians and to comply with international law , including the rules of necessity and proportionality , '' Richardson wrote .
In April , Richardson travelled to Afghanistan , where the Saudi -born Bin Laden lives , and received a promise from Taliban leaders to keep him `` under wraps '' and prevent him from using Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activities .
`` It is the sincere hope of the United States government that these limited actions will deter and prevent the repetition of unlawful terrorist attacks on the United States and other countries , '' Richardson wrote .
`` We call on all nations to take the steps necessary to bring such indiscriminate terrorism to an end , '' he wrote in the letter to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia .
