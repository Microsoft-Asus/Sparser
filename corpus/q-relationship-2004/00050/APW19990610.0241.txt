LOS ANGELES
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Three Mexican businessmen were convicted Thursday of laundering tens of millions of dollars for a Colombian drug cartel .
Three others were acquitted in the case , which accused 40 Mexican and Venezuelan businessmen and bankers of helping drug cartel members launder their money .
The arrests were part of a three-year U.S. Customs sting that spanned several countries .
The operation raised tensions between the United States and Mexico , which was kept in the dark about the investigation into its citizens .
Agents arrested 167 people , including top Mexican bankers and executives , in the sting .
Convicted of conspiracy and money laundering on Thursday were Jose Reyes Ortega Gonzales , a former manager of banking operations for Bancomer in Tepatitlan , Mexico ; Manuel Barraza Leon , a Bancomer branch manager in Tijuana ; and Alfonso Labrada Gurrola , who worked at a Tijuana law firm that represented banks .
Acquitted were Javier Alcala Navarro ; Katy Kissel Belfer , a broker at CBI International Securities in Mexico City ; and Fernando Barragan Reyes , a stock broker .
U.S. customs officials seized $ 100 million from 14 banks and dozens of individuals who were accused of laundering money for the Cali drug cartel in Colombia , and the Juarez cartel in Mexico .
Mexico accused the United States of intruding on Mexican sovereignty by conducting a sting without its involvement .
Two of the largest banks pleaded guilty in March to money laundering charges .
Last month , seven defendants were indicted for laundering money for the Cali cartel and pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy or drug trafficking .
Their sentences were pending .
Others are awaiting trial .
