BEIJING , December 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- China hopes that future negotiations at the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- will genuinely take into account the demands of all the participants , those of developing countries in particular .
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remarks in Beijing today while commenting on the WTO Ministerial Conference that recently concluded in Singapore .
He said the conference came to its conclusion as scheduled , and eventually reached some common understandings , adding that the outcome , however , reflected more of the concerns and interests of developed nations .
