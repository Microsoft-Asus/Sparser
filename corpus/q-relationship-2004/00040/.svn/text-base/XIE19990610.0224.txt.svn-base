CANBERRA , June 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Australian government said Thursday it is to take legal action against Japan over its unilateral decision to override international quotas on threatened southern bluefin tuna .
Japan last week announced it would recommence its `` experimental fishing program '' -LRB- EFP -RRB- for the tuna , the same program under which last year it took 1,400 tons , or 25 percent , above its quota of the highly prized fish .
Australian Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Mark Vaile said Japan had ignored protests from both Australia and New Zealand , leaving Australia with no option .
`` I regret that our views were disregarded by Japan and that despite our informal protests , the unilateral EFP has been resumed , '' he said in a statement .
`` I understand there are several Japanese long-liners now fishing in the Southern Ocean not far from our fishing zone , '' he said .
`` The government has decided to act decisively , '' he added .
Vaile did not say how Australia would pursue its legal action , but said the government was examining numerous options and working with New Zealand to ensure it had the maximum effect .
He said Australia had also indefinitely extended its ban on Japanese fishing boats entering Australian ports or fishing inside the Australian fishing zone .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he was concerned that the dispute could harm otherwise good relations between Australia and Japan .
`` It is disappointing that it has come to this ...
This is not an issue Australia can , or will back away from , '' he said in a statement .
