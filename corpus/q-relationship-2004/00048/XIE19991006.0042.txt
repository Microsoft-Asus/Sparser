HONG KONG , October 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -LRB- SAR -RRB- follows international standards in controlling the import and export of strategic commodities , including computers and microprocessors , according a government spokesman Tuesday .
In response to press inquiries concerning the existing scope of controls over import and export of strategic commodities , the spokesman said such controls are essential for the purpose of maintaining the confidence of supplying countries of these products in our system .
The controls thereby enable Hong Kong 's businesses to continue to have access to high-tech products and cutting-edge technologies which originate from these countries and which are necessary for the economic development , he noted .
`` The HKSAR 's existing import and export licensing controls over central processing unit -LRB- CPU -RRB- follows exactly the same standard of controls adopted by the Wassenaar Arrangement , the concerned international non-proliferation regimes looking after the control of dual-use strategic goods , '' he said .
The Wassenaar Arrangement has maintained that CPU with 260 million theoretical operations per seconds -LRB- Mtops -RRB- or above should be controlled .
`` In line with our policy to follow the international standard of controls , CPU with 260 Mtops or above , therefore , continue to remain on the government 's control list , '' the spokesman said .
`` However , we understand that there will be discussions at the Wassenaar Arrangement on the control thresholds of CPU and we would be prepared to follow should the Wassenaar Arrangement decide to relax the existing controls on CPU , '' he said .
`` We have proposed legislative amendments to incorporate such revisions as well as other changes into our own control list by amending the schedules to the Import and Export -LRB- Strategic Commodities -RRB- Regulations .
Subject to the approval of the Legislative Council , the new control threshold would come into effect on 22 October 1999 , '' he revealed .
Recognizing the need to facilitate trade in lower end computer related products , the Trade Department of the HKSAR has taken steps to speed up the license processing time .
A simplified arrangement has been put in place for license applications covering CPUs which are commonly available in the market and are not very sensitive in nature , the spokesman said .
The department provides pre-license classification in advance and gives expeditious approval of subsequent license applications .
This has significantly shortened the time required to process such license applications .
During the past three months , 80 percent of the issued CPU licenses were processed within our pledged time of three working days , according to the spokesman .
`` With effect from March 1 , 1999 , the department has also extended the validity of export license from 28 days to 3 months .
We believe that this has provided additional flexibility to exporters in arranging the export of their goods . ''
