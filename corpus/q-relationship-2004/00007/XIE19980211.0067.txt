TEHRAN , February 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iran is seriously concerned about a possible attack on Iraq by the United States as the impacts upon Iran , although indirect as they would be , are believed to be serious .
Tehran is keeping a close and cautious eye on the developments in the Gulf as the U.S. and Britain step up military build-up in the region following a standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over arms inspection .
Iranian officials have expressed the fear that when the attack takes place , hundreds of thousands of displaced Iraqis will flood into Iran , nullifying Iran 's years of efforts to repatriate 1 million Iraqi refugees .
Furthermore , the officials have warned , members of the Mujahideen Khalg Organization -LRB- MKO -RRB- , Iran 's major opposition group , will miss no opportunities to make an infiltration into Iran .
Since it was outlawed in the early 1980s , the MKO has been fighting the Tehran authorities .
It even resorted to terrorist means against Iran 's interests throughout the world .
`` The MKO can not pose a serious threat to the Iranian security and stability , '' foreign diplomats here noted .
`` Tehran 's worries are the possibility of disintegration of Iraq and a change of power in the country following the possible U.S. military strike . ''
Possible Iraqi disintegration would cause insecurity to Iran 's western borders with Iraq , the diplomats added , the Iraqi Kurdish factional fighting and the Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq during the past years have aroused Iran 's concern .
With millions of Iranian Kurds living in the border areas , Iran can not tolerate a chaotic situation on the other side of the border .
Iranian officials have stressed that the Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity should be fully maintained .
Moreover , Tehran feels uneasy about U.S. and British military presence in the Gulf .
Three aircraft carriers , hundreds of fighter jets and thousands of troops have been deployed in the region .
The U.S. accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism , undermining the Mideast peace process and seeking weapons of mass destruction .
It has been striving to isolate Iran for years through economic sanctions .
The escalation of tension between Washington and Baghdad will only strengthen U.S. military buildup in the region , keeping Iran 's armed forces `` on alert against any possible aggression , '' Iranian officials have said .
`` The only way to restore peace and stability in the region is the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. military forces from the Persian Gulf region , '' Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said last Sunday .
Iranian officials have stepped up diplomatic efforts to help avert a possible U.S. military attack on Iraq by calling on the U.N. Security Council , the Organization of the Islamic Conference and regional countries to use their influence .
Tehran also has urged Baghdad to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions , `` giving no excuses '' to the U.S. to launch military attacks .
`` Military operations will only escalate tensions in the whole region and worsen the situation , '' the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has said , stressing that the Iraq crisis should be resolved peacefully through continued diplomatic efforts .
