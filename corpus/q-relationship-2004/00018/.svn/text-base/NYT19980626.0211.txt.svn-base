TOKYO --
South Korean army officers said Friday that they had found evidence that the North Korean submarine caught this week in a fishing net had been engaged in an infiltration mission and had just picked up or dropped off spies or commandos .
A search of the submarine found the bodies of nine North Koreans , four of whom were grouped together and had died of single gunshot wounds to the head .
The five others were scattered around the submarine and had bullet wounds in various parts of their bodies , the South Korean authorities said .
`` There were some signs of disagreement among them about whether to commit a group suicide , '' said Maj. Gen. Chung Young -jin .
`` It appears as if five were shot first by the remaining four , who then killed themselves afterward . ''
The submarine was discovered after its periscope became tangled in a drift net 11 miles off the South Korean coast .
North Korea has said it was on a routine training run and somehow became wrecked and drifted off course , but the South rejected that explanation Friday as a `` baseless fabrication . ''
Many military analysts say North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off spies in South Korea for intelligence gathering , but any public evidence of that would heighten the tensions between the two Koreas .
It would also make it more difficult for South Korean President Kim Dae -jung to pursue his policy of conciliation to the North .
North Korea did not respond to the espionage allegations .
However , it has consistently denied sending infiltrators into South Korea .
So far , South Korean officials are emphasizing that economic cooperation with the North will not be affected by the incursion .
`` We need to cope sternly with the national security issue , but economic issues do n't need to be disturbed , '' said Kang In -duk , the national unification minister .
South Korean officials said they found two South Korean soft drink containers in the submarine , an indication that there might have been a pickup of spies along the coast .
Some of the North Koreans also had sand on their clothes , as if they had been on a beach recently , South Korean television reported .
On board the submarine , searchers found two AK -47 assault rifles , two heavier machine guns , a rocket launcher , two handguns and two grenades .
There was also some American -made diving equipment such as wet suits and flippers .
`` Considering their clothes and weapons and other materials , it is certain that the submarine was engaged in an infiltration mission by the North 's special agents , '' the Defense Ministry said in a statement .
The South Korean news media are speculating that the five North Koreans who appear to have been executed may have been the submarine 's crew , while the four who committed suicide may have been commandos who had just been picked up .
South Korea has examined the submarine with enormous care for fear that it might be booby-trapped .
Instead of entering by the hatch , navy investigators first drilled small holes in the side and inserted cameras to check for bombs .
Among those investigating the submarine is Lee Kwang -su , the only known survivor of a North Korean submarine incursion in 1996 .
In that case , the submarine ran aground on the South Korean coast , and 26 people on board slipped ashore .
Of those 26 , most were killed by South Korean armed forces or executed by fellow North Koreans who apparently feared that they would disclose information if caught .
One was never found and is presumed to have either made his way back to the North or to have died in the woods .
