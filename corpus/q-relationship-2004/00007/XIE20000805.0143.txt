MANILA , August 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada returned to Manila Saturday morning from his first official working visit to the United States , a trip resulted in more than expected fruits eyed by himself and some analysts .
During his U.S. journey which started on July 24 , Estrada obtained Washington 's commitments on issues like the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines , the Mindanao insurgency , and the possible remediation of contaminated sites that used to house American facilities .
The commitments were mainly reflected in seven bilateral agreements that cover defense and security , economic and development cooperation , trade and investment .
The agreements were signed on July 27 , the same date when Estrada and U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks in the White House .
Estrada said he was very pleased with his talks with President Clinton , adding that the discussion paved the way for cooperation between the two countries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In one of the major agreements , the United States agreed to provide 105-million-U.S.- dollar military equipment to the Philippines , a development that augurs well for the revitalization of the Philippines - U.S. relations .
The relations between the two countries had somewhat been affected by the 1991 termination of the Americans ' lease on various military installations in the Philippines , particularly the Subic Bay Naval Facility and Clark Air Base </ENAMEX>.
The Philippines - U.S. relations were enhanced anew last year with the Philippine Senate 's approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement , which Estrada had endorsed to bring back joint military operations by Filipino and America soldiers , as well as port calls by U.S. vessels .
On the issue of the possible remediation of contaminated sites that used to house American facilities , the two governments signed a joint statement to cooperate on dealing with environmental and public health problems in the Philippines .
The Philippines - U.S. joint statement on bilateral cooperation on the environment and public health said the two countries will '' enhance the institutional and technical capacity of the Philippines to address environmental and public health problems . ''
The statement was silent on the fate of toxic waste victims in the vicinity of the former U.S. bases , saying vaguely that the armed forces of both countries will `` discuss ways to reduce the environmental impact of peacetime military activities . ''
On Mindanao issue , Estrada got some support from the United States .
Estrada said he explained to Clinton why he pursued military action against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front .
The United States also committed to providing 20-million-dollar food aid to Mindanao .
The Philippine president said Clinton was `` very happy '' about the Philippine government 's handling of the conflict with Moro rebels in southern Philippines and `` assured me of America 's support to our peace process '' in Mindanao .
Selling the Philippines to U.S. investors was another major agenda of Estrada 's trip .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In addressing U.S. business executives and Filipino - Americans , Estrada said that the Philippine economy is on the rebound and is now a hot place for investment , particularly in e-commerce -LRB- electronic commerce -RRB- that has defined the world 's New Economy .
Estrada said that the Philippines has the potential of becoming `` information technology -LRB- IT -RRB- services hub '' of Asia , boasting a highly skilled , English -speaking young workforce that was considered among the world 's best IT managers and professionals .</ENAMEX>
In Seattle , Estrada discussed with Microsoft honcho Bill Gates on the IT development in the Philippines .
He also received 12 million U.S. dollars worth of software donation for some 1,000 public high schools in the Philippines .
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Estrada 's U.S. trip `` is a defining moment not only for the century -old American relations but for the Estrada presidency as well . ''
Some analysts also said the U.S. trip has succeeded in setting the tone for a more strategic partnership between these two standing allies into the 21st century .
However , the Philippine president failed to get U.S. commitments on several key issues between the two countries , such as the clearing of former U.S. bases , the dumping of U.S. products in the Philippines , and the compensation to Filipino war veterans .
Meanwhile , as U.S. President Clinton will step down from office in next January and President Estrada has many difficult problems to deal with at home , the future relations between the two countries still remain to be seen .
