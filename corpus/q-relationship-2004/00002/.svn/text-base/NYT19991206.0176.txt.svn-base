WASHINGTON , Dec. 6 -LRB- States News Service -RRB- - Possible back-to-back Mars mission failures cost NASA more in prestige than in taxpayer dollars .
The $ 120 million Mars Polar Lander , feared lost this week , could join the failed $ 85 million Mars Climate Orbiter in NASA 's hall of shame .
Yet at a combined total of $ 235 million , including the $ 30 million Deep Space probes that were attached to the MPL but are also unaccounted for , the two successive failures would be just 1.7 percent of NASA 's $ 13.6 billion budget for next year .
The back-to-back losses are meager compared to the failure of the $ 1 billion 1992 Mars Observer -LRB- in that year 's dollars -RRB- .
The Mars Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander make up just 23.5 percent of that mission , which NASA scientists lost contact with in 1993 .
Nor are the recent losses costly compared to the $ 400 million on average that NASA shells out for every space shuttle mission .
Most years see at least six shuttle missions , though 1999 had only two .
Other less flashy NASA missions can cost far more than MPL , which garnered national media attention last week .
For instance , NASA 's Terra satellite , to be launched Dec. 16 , costs $ 1.3 billion , a full $ 1 billion over the cost of the two-mission Mars Surveyor in 1998 .
Terra will look at the earth 's atmosphere and oceans .
During the Cold War space race with the Soviet Union , NASA enjoyed unlimited costs for early Mars exploration efforts , with vastly more personnel .
Dr. Jeffrey Soffen was project scientist for Viking missions to Mars 1968 to 1979 , said during the first Viking landing on Mars , JPL had `` 1,000 people involved in the actual landing , '' from mission trajectory experts to spacecraft engineers .
`` It was a mob of people . ''
But now , `` you simply do n't have as many people , '' which he said made things worse for recent Mars missions .
In some ways , cooperation with former enemies has proven more costly than competition .
The International Space Station , with delays and cost-overruns in part attributed to problems with Russian and European space agencies , will cost about 250 times what the lost Mars missions have cost - that 's $ 60 billion .
