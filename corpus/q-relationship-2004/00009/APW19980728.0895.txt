ASHGABAT , Turkmenistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A pipeline across the Caspian Sea would be the most reliable way to export Turkmenistan 's natural gas to Turkey and the rest of Europe , a U.S. ambassador said Tuesday .
Richard Morningstar , an adviser to President Bill Clinton on the former Soviet republics , spoke to reporters after meeting Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov .
`` Turkmenistan must survive today , '' Niyazov said .
`` That is why we are ready to consider the possibilities of Turkmen gas exports .
But we prefer the route that will be developed faster . ''
Morningstar and a Turkish envoy were in Turkmenistan , a former Soviet republic in Central Asia , to try to persuade Niyazov to speed up a decision on a pipeline .
Both countries have been campaigning for an oil pipeline running from Azerbaijan 's capital , Baku , through Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan , as well as a pipeline to carry Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey .
The United States favors pipeline routes to Turkey because of its strong opposition to any plans to transport Caspian Sea oil and gas to markets through Iran , a country that Washington considers unreliable .
However , it is the shortest and cheapest route .
The other possible route , through Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea , is consider a longshot because of continued fighting in Afghanistan and the insolvency of both Turkmenistan and Pakistan , where the pipeline would end .
From Ashgabat , Morningstar is scheduled to fly to Baku , Azerbaijan , and Tbilisi , Georgia , to discuss the pipeline route .
The five states bordering on the Caspian are due to meet in Moscow on Sept. 1 , Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said , according to the ITAR - Tass news agency .
