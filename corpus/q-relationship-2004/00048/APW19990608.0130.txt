WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Clinton administration is considering making it easier for U.S. companies to sell high-powered computers to other countries by easing export restrictions on them .
It 's not clear when the Commerce Department , which has been working with other agencies on the matter for about a year now , will send the White House a final proposal , administration officials said Tuesday , speaking on condition of anonymity .
`` The issue is under review but we do not anticipate a decision by the end of the week , '' said National Security Council spokesman Michael Hammer , noting a White House meeting on the issue scheduled for Friday .
People involved in the debate over the export restrictions said the Commerce Department was considering loosening exports rules on certain computer sales to most countries in Asia , Africa , Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe .
But for now , the administration is leaning against easing those restrictions on China and about 50 other countries , those people said .
`` I think in the end it 's a mistake to treat the current problem of China in a Cold War fashion , '' said Daniel Goure , a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
`` To try and put a barrier down and expect that to last more than a nanosecond is just crazy .
What you need is not tighter controls , but a different approach . ''
But a Commerce Department official said `` no decisions have been reached '' regarding sales to China or any other countries .
The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the administration was preparing to loosen export controls on about 100 countries , but keep them on China and about 50 others .
Just two weeks ago , a special House committee cataloged 20 years of Chinese espionage against the United States .
A congressional panel , chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox , concluded China has been involved in the theft of nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons labs -- including culling key military information from commercial purchases of high-powered computers and other technology .
The computer industry -- upset that existing export rules limit their overseas sales -- has been pushing the administration for more leeway to export more powerful computers , particularly to China , a big , potentially lucrative market .
The industry and other supporters of looser export controls contend that the existing restrictions are out of date , given the rapid advances in computer technology .
Goure said the restrictions limit U.S. companies from selling computer technology that is already available elsewhere .
The federal government regulates the overseas sale of computers based on their speed , measured by how many millions of theoretical operations the machines can perform per second .
To sell to the countries that would be included in the proposed export changes , computer companies have to get government licenses for any machine that can perform more than 10,000 of the operations per second , Goure said .
The computer industry is pushing to have that tripled to 30,000 .

The White House is sympathetic but has not determined how much to ease controls on computer sales and will not make any announcement at the Friday meeting , a White House official said .
