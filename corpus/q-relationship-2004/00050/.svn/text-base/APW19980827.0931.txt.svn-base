BOGOTA , Colombia
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
After years of failed efforts to extradite the leaders one of Colombia 's most powerful drug mafias to stand trial in the United States , American prosecutors may have finally gotten the break they needed .
The arrest in Bogota last week of a Venezuelan nicknamed `` Fatso '' is bad news for Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela , the Cali cartel chiefs captured in 1995 .
If , as expected , he is extradited or expelled to the United States , the alleged longtime cartel associate could provide the testimony needed to get the Rodriguez brothers in a U.S. courtroom , where they would face life terms .
U.S. authorities consider Colombia 's dismantling of the Cali cartel one of the greatest strikes ever against organized crime .
Extraditing the cartel bosses was forbidden , however , by Colombia 's 1991 constitution .
Congress lifted that ban late last year , but in an apparent bow to traffickers ' threats and payoffs , it allowed extradition only for crimes committed after December 1997 .
The measure virtually guaranteed that the Rodriguez Orejuelas would remain in Colombia , provided they did n't violate U.S. laws again .
Now it appears they may have .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">During the past three months , police say , the 308-pound -LRB- 140-kilogram -RRB- Fernando Jose Flores visited the Rodriguez brothers 17 times at La Picota prison </ENAMEX>.
What the men discussed , if police indeed know , has not been made public .
But the contacts alone with the 37-year -old Venezuelan , who was carrying false documents when arrested , have raised intense speculation that the Cali kingpins have continued to traffic in cocaine from prison , a longtime contention of U.S. officials .
`` I 'd love to have him , '' a U.S. federal prosecutor with knowledge of Flores ' activities told The Associated Press , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The arrest apparently put the Rodriguez brothers on edge .
In a letter sent to Semana magazine , which reported that Flores owed the two money , the brothers admitted to the Venezuelan 's recent visits but said he was just a friend .
If Flores was trafficking in drugs at the time `` it was on his own behalf and without any conniving by us , '' the brothers wrote , insisting they had put their `` sordid past behind . ''
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents , who tracked Flores and asked Colombian police to arrest him , refused to discuss the case .
But other U.S. officials said they would seek his extradition , and that he could also be expelled to the United States .
The Americans do not want Flores expelled to Venezuela , because that country does not extradite its own citizens for trial abroad .
Flores is under U.S. indictment for allegedly helping the Cali cartel ship about eight tons of cocaine to Florida in 1991 , hiding it in cement posts and moving it through a Venezuelan front company .
If Flores ' capture does eventually lead to extradition for the Rodriguez brothers , the process is bound to be a lengthy and arduous .
The first step for prosecutors is to get him to the United States -- where he faces life in prison if convicted -- and see if he accepts a plea bargain and implicates his associates .
Colombian drug cartels have a long history of murdering turncoats -- or their families .
The Venezuelan is being held under heavy guard at a Bogota police station .
Under Colombian law , the Rodriguez brothers could only be sent to the United States after they finish serving out 22- and 10-year Colombian sentences .
With good behavior , both men could be freed much sooner .
