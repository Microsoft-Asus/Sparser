MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Russia and Japan have made considerable progress in preparing a peace treaty that would formally end World War II , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday .
The two countries have never signed a treaty ending the war because of an on-going dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain which were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news briefing that the latest meeting between a Russian and Japanese treaty commission in Tokyo on June 22 `` showed the sides ' constructive mood and converging positions on the majority of the issues , '' the Interfax news agency reported .
He said the two sides `` have started to coordinate the main provisions of the future treaty , except for the territorial issues . ''
