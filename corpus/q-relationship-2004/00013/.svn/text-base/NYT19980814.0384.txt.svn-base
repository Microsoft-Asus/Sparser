There are 25 immigrants in the United States who are facing deportation or exclusion from the country largely on evidence that they are not permitted to see and that comes from people who are not identified .
The federal government has defended the use of secret evidence in these cases , which usually involve allegations of association with terrorists , but not actual charges of terrorism .
Government officials argue that the only way to persuade people to give information about terrorist activities is to offer the protection of complete anonymity .
Cases that involve allegations derived from secret evidence are just a tiny percentage of the more than 100,000 immigrant-status cases that the Immigration and Naturalization Service deals with every year , said agency officials .
But all of those being held in these cases are of Arab descent or are Muslims .
To Hala Maksoud , president of the Arab - American Anti - Discrimination Committee , this has the smell of `` human and civil rights somehow being suspended when it comes to Muslims . ''
Russ Bergeron , a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service , said that he could not comment on specific cases or give the names of all 25 men involved in secret-evidence cases .
But Bergeron defended the use of secret evidence and cited the approval of the practice under certain conditions by federal courts over four decades .
`` What essentially these courts have said is that the obligation of the U.S. government to protect its citizens from threats at times justifies a modification in the due process that will normally be granted in judicial proceedings , '' Bergeron said .
A senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that it was not unusual for intelligence-gathering agencies to provide information in immigration cases .
He also defended keeping secret the details of information provided , to protect the informers and `` costly technical systems that took years to develop , '' like satellite surveillance systems .
`` These systems could be compromised by a disclosure that could indicate the method of operation , '' said the official .
The use of secret evidence is not new .
The procedures have been in place and validated by courts since the early 1950s , when communism loomed as the perceived national-security threat .
Today , when the fear is that Middle East terrorism will spill over into the United States , the number of cases based on secret evidence has increased , said immigration officials .
There have been 50 cases since 1992 , according to a February letter from Lori Scialabba , the acting INS counsel at the time .
One of those cases played out in Newark , N.J. , last week , when a man who has been held in jail since March had his day in court .
He says he believes that the only person accusing him of anything is his former wife .
But the names of his accusers are a secret .
To the accused immigrants , many of whom have been held in detention for up to two years awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings , and to their lawyers , this secret evidence -- a vague summary of the secret data that never directly accuse the immigrants of wrongdoing -- invites surreal literary comparisons .
`` It 's Kafkaesque , '' said James Woolsey , the former director of the CIA and a lawyer who is part of a team representing six exiled Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein .
The six were among a group of 6,000 exiles brought to the United States in 1996 after their CIA -supported efforts to undermine Saddam failed .
They have been detained for a year on the basis of secret evidence .
For a time immigration officials would not let even Woolsey , who continues to have the highest of security clearances , view the secret data .
INS officials later said this was a mistake and they declassified nearly three-quarters of the material and provided unclassified summaries of the rest .
`` It was stunning , '' said Woolsey in a telephone interview .
Although he did not provide copies of the files , he said that much of the so-called secret data turned out to be vague suspicions , some the result of lies prompted by jealousies among the exiles and some mistakes in translation during FBI interviews of the exiles .
`` This is something that would have been entirely appropriate in Iraq , '' Woolsey said .
`` But it is an outrage for the United States . ''
Noel Saleh , a Detroit immigration lawyer , said that his experience was more reminiscent of Alice `` going through the looking glass . ''
His client , Imad Hamad -- a 35-year -old social worker from Detroit who has lived in the United States since 1980 and is married to a citizen -- had to battle repeated efforts by immigration officials to keep him from getting permanent residency .
Starting with immigration court hearings in 1989 , the INS began brandishing FBI reports and photographs of Hamad participating in demonstrations and fund-raising events for local Arab - American groups and suggesting that he was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
But none of the proceedings , which continued off and on through 1993 , resulted in a final deportation order .
Then earlier this year INS officials said that they had secret evidence .
At first they withheld it from from Hamad and his lawyer but showed it to the immigration court judge .
The judge dismissed it , saying that Hamad , a homeowner and father of three who was married to a naturalized U.S. citizen was not a security risk .
He granted him permanent resident status .
The INS is appealing this ruling , but in June it declassified much of the secret evidence that it sought to use to bar Hamad .
`` The things they said were secret evidence turned out to be the same declassified stuff we saw from the FBI back in the 1989 hearing , '' said Saleh .
`` What was declassified should never have been classified in the first place . ''
Myron Marlin , a Justice Department spokesman , said that the court cases allowing the use of secret evidence have considered grants of political asylum and other efforts for noncitizens as `` discretionary benefits and extraordinary acts of sovereign generosity . ''
They are not rights , he said , and because they are discretionary , national security or other considerations can be brought to bear .
The result is that in certain immigration proceedings , noncitizens are not guaranteed the due process that they would have in criminal cases .
Although the courts have upheld the use of secret evidence in immigration cases , the Justice Department , which oversees the INS and the Executive Office of Immigration Review -- whose 200 judges hear most immigration cases -- has recently acknowledged that some changes may be in order .
In meetings in June with a group complaining about the use of secret evidence , Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said that his office would start reviewing all material used as secret evidence in immigration cases .
He also said the Justice Department would re-evaluate the classified nature of some of the allegations in the pending 25 cases and make it a practice to provide lawyers and their clients with declassified summaries of the classified data .
In addition , two U.S. senators are voicing concern because all of the current cases using secret evidence are against people of Arab descent or Muslims .
In a letter last week to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner , the two senators -- Spencer Abraham of Michigan , the Republican chairman of the subcommittee on immigration , and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee -- said they had `` grave concerns '' about the fairness and due-process issues raised by the use of secret evidence .
`` Some also believe that the recent actions create the appearance that the INS may be using secret evidence only in cases against Arab immigrants , '' the letter said .
`` This is especially disturbing since many of these cases appear to be based not on any actions of the immigrants , but rather on their purported associations . ''
The Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings next month on the INS and its detention practices .
Louis Bograd , head of the prison project of the American Civil Liberties Union and a member of the coalition , said that the anti-terrorism act authorized the establishment of a new judicial arm called `` alien terrorist removal courts , '' which would be empowered to use secret evidence to deport suspected terrorists .
But those courts , which have yet to be established , would allow lawyers with security clearances to view the secret evidence and permit judges to order fuller declassified summaries that could be seen by the immigrant .
`` We do n't think these protections are adequate , but they are certainly better than what INS is now providing when it comes to secret evidence , '' said Bograd , who represents Nasser Ahmed , a New York man who has been held in prison for 27 months largely because of secret evidence .
`` If the government can use secret evidence against resident aliens , then there is no real constitutional impediment to using it against citizens . ''
Woolsey disagreed somewhat , saying that there were situations in which secret evidence could be used , but only with `` strict safeguards . ''
`` I am not opposed to it completely as long as there are procedures to share the information with counsel who have security clearances , '' he said .
This might help find problem cases , such as those of people with ulterior motives making charges under the cover of secrecy .
Hany Kiareldeen is a 30-year -old manager of a Passaic , N.J. , electronics store who has been in the United States since 1990 , and has spent five months in jail .
A declassified summary of the allegations against him that was given to his lawyer in April said that unnamed informants accused him of making `` a credible threat '' on Reno 's life in conversations and of meeting with Nidal Ayyad , one of the convicted World Trade Center bombers , a week before the explosion at the building in 1993 .
Edward Shulman , the lawyer who is fighting INS efforts to deport Kiareldeen to his native Gaza , said that he and his client , who denies making any threats or even knowing Ayyad , suspect that the secret evidence came from his former wife , who , the lawyer said , had a history of vindictiveness even before the couple 's bitter divorce a year ago .
During a deportation hearing this week in Immigration Court in Newark , INS lawyers expressed concern that opening the hearing to the public and allowing Shulman to ask certain questions of some witnesses could reveal the identity of and jeopardize the safety of a secret informer who they said had received death threats .
Kiareldeen 's former wife , Amal Mohamed , was called to the stand to testify .
She balked at answering questions about contacts she had had with the FBI in the case , saying that it was her life that had been threatened by some unknown forces .
The case was adjourned until Sept. 18 and Kiareldeen was returned to a prison cell while his lawyers sought an order from a federal judge to compel Ms. Mohamed to testify .
`` It 's like we do n't know who we are fighting , '' said Ms. Maksoud , referring to Kiareldeen 's and others ' cases .
`` It 's mind-boggling . ''
