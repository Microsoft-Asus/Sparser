WASHINGTON --
A former CIA director , John Deutch , asked the Pentagon Wednesday to drop his last remaining security clearances , which had remained in effect even after the agency 's current director suspended his highest clearances last August .
In a statement prepared by his Washington lawyer , Deutch said that he had not used the `` industrial '' security clearances to gain access to any classified information since the current director , George Tenet , suspended the other clearances .
The suspension was ordered by Tenet as a result of an investigation by the agency 's inspector general , which found that Deutch had mishandled classified documents while serving as director .
The inquiry found that he had placed classified material on personal computers in his home , including information about some of the government 's most sensitive covert operations .
Tenet had suspended Deutch 's clearances at the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency .
But Deutch had retained three industrial security clearances , which allowed him to work on specific Defense Department contracts for Raytheon , the SAIC Corp. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where Deutch teaches .
The clearances were limited ones , and did not give him access to a wide range of intelligence information .
Deutch was deputy secretary of defense , the No. 2 position at the Pentagon , from 1994 until May 1995 , when he was confirmed as director of central intelligence .
He resigned from the CIA in December 1996 .
On Monday , Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon was considering ending the former director 's security clearances .
But Deutch short-circuited the process Tuesday when his lawyer , Terrence O'Donnell , sent a letter to the deputy secretary of defense , John Hamre , asking that the clearances be revoked .
