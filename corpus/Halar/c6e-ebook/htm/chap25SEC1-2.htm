And tracing phylogeny is one of the main goals of <span class="Emphasis2">systematics,</span> the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Systematics includes taxonomy, which is the naming and classification of species and groups of species. Formal taxonomy began in the 18th century with Linnaeus’s book <span class="Emphasis1">Systema naturae</span>, which translates as "System of Nature," meaning a classification of all known natural life. A century later, Darwin both anticipated the future direction of taxonomy and introduced the new science of systematics when he wrote in <span class="Emphasis1">The Origin of Species</span> that "our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies." In this section, we examine the connection between phylogeny and classification that is at the center of modern systematics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
