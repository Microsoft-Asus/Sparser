ANKARA , September 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Leaders of the two major Kurdish factions in northern Iraq will meet in Ankara next week to discuss the situation in northern Iraq .
Massoud Barzani , leader of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- , and Jalal Talabani , chairman of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , and Turkish officials will attend the meeting , Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said Wednesday .
At a weekly press conference , Utkan said the upcoming talks are the continuation of the Ankara peace process , which was launched by Turkey with the support of the U.S. and Britain after the 1991 Gulf War , the Anatolia News Agency reported .
The projected meeting comes after the two Kurdish groups signed a U.S. -brokered pact on September 17 to end their rivalry in northern Iraq .
The U.S. -led Western alliance set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq for the Kurds after their rebellion against President Saddam Hussein failed soon after the Gulf War .
But the two factions have since fought for the control of the area .
The pact unites them in the common goal of establishing an elected government by summer 1999 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Turkey , like Iraq , strongly opposes the creation of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq , fearing that the move will encourage the statehood aspirations of the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- , which has been fighting since 1984 for autonomy in southeastern Turkey</ENAMEX> .
Ankara reacted to the KDP - PUK accord with an instant decision to send an ambassador to Baghdad , the first since the Gulf War , and accused the move of being detrimental to Iraq 's territorial integrity .
By hosting the meeting of Kurdish faction leaders , it appeared that Ankara wants to bring them into its fold and minimize the impact of their accord , rather than alienate them , analysts said .
Referring to the pact , the spokesman said that Turkey was pleased with some parts of the agreement that both the KDP and PUK will strive to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq .
