-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The National Assembly has taken steps to facilitate transition to a fully representative government a week before all-party peace talks on Burundi are to begin in neighboring Tanzania .
It amended the 1992 constitution and a decree passed after President Pierre Buyoya took power in a July 1996 military coup .
The changes cement the legitimacy of the mainly Hutu FRODEBU and the multi-ethnic Uprona parties to pave the way for their participation in the peace-process .
Fighting between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus has claimed more than 200,000 lives since 1993 .
FRODEBU holds a majority of the 81 seats in the largely non-functional parliament .
A number of its members have either been killed or are in exile following Buyoya 's coup .
Buyoya is expected to participate for the first time in peace talks that have been held intermittently since his takeover .

In recent weeks more than 2,200 cholera cases have been registered by North Kivu health officials and another 700 people have been infected in other provinces , the radio report said .
Cholera is common in parts of West and Central Africa , where sources of clean drinking water are scarce and people are often forced to drink and bathe in the same polluted water .
-- MONROVIA , Liberia -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The head of the U.N. refugee agency has asked some 55,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in a northern Liberia border village to relocate to a more accessible -- and safer -- town in Liberia 's interior .
UNHCR director Soren Jessen - Petersen said at the end of a three-day visit to Liberia on Thursday that the Sierra Leoneans had fled to the Liberian border town of Vahun early this year to escape rebel attacks in northwestern Sierra Leone .
Roads linking Vahun with Liberia 's major centers have been washed away during the rainy season , forcing aid trucks to discontinue trips to the town , which is also vulnerable to rebel attacks , Jessen - Petersen said .
UNHCR workers had asked the refugees to trek some 70 kilometers -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- to Kailahun , a Liberian town accessible by road .
Jessen - Petersen visited Sierra Leone earlier this week for talks aimed at eventually repatriating more than a half-million Sierra Leonean refugees living mainly in Liberia and Guinea .

The two governments said in a joint statement that they hoped discussions with a cross-section of businessmen would lead to a substantial trade increase .
