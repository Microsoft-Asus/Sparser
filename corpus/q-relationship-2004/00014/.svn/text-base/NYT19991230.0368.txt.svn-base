WASHINGTON --
An FBI roundup in five states Thursday resulted in arrests of at least nine people , including one linked to a suspected Algerian terrorist accused of smuggling explosives into the United States .
The nine arrests came as federal authorities detained dozens of people for questioning less than 48 hours before Americans begin celebrating the new year .
In all , more than 40 people were interviewed in Texas , New York , California , Massachusetts and Washington about possible links to Ahmed Ressam , who was arrested crossing the U.S. - Canadian border near Seattle in a car loaded with bomb-making equipment .
Ghani , one of four arrested in New York , was charged with `` concealing his material support '' for Ressam 's effort `` to violate federal explosive laws . ''
Ghani , an Algerian national , also was charged with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud .
The eight others were charged in Boston and New York with immigration violations .
No one in Houston or Dallas was charged .
FBI officials decided to launch the exercise after determining `` it was time to do overt interviews '' based on information gathered since Ressam 's arrest on Dec. 14 and the border arrest four days later of a woman linked to an Algerian terrorist network .
An official acknowledged that , in addition to gathering information about Ressam , the `` series of concerted interviews '' was timed to send a signal to would-be terrorists who may be targeting the United States during the holiday weekend .
Court documents filed Thursday allege that Ressam and Ghani are part of a plan involving aliases , fake passports and a rental car loaded with explosives that was to be dropped off for an unidentified accomplice .
Federal officials said they have not identified any city that might be a focus of any attack .
Ghani 's arrest and the questioning of others are `` part of efforts to pursue all information regarding the risk of any planned attacks , '' said Mary Jo White , the U.S. attorney in New York .
She said inquiries so far have `` not suggested any specific and credible threats against any particular targets , either in New York or elsewhere . ''
Don Clark , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Houston office , said the `` possibility of terrorism always exists , '' but nothing indicates a specific , immediate threat in Houston .
`` I 'd like to think that because of the things that we have done , we have lessened that possibility , '' Clark said .
In Dallas , FBI agent Lori Bailey confirmed that interviews were being conducted with people there `` who have been identified in the investigation -LRB- of Ressam -RRB- as having information that might be helpful . ''
She denied any racial tinge to the interviews .
`` No one is being targeted because of their religious or ethnic backgrounds , '' Bailey said .
All five of those arrested in Boston are Algerian nationals .
One of them was the only person to resist authorities , who ended up chasing the man with guns drawn , a helicopter hovering overhead and police dogs combing the neighborhood .
The roundup occurred as prosecutors in Vermont drew a link between a Canadian woman , Lucia Garofalo , and the Armed Islamic Group , a militant Algerian group blamed for terrorist activities in Europe and Africa .
Prosecutors also have tied Ressam to the group .
Garofalo was arrested Dec. 19 as she drove into the United States from Canada in a vehicle carrying Bouabide Chamchi , an Algerian national who allegedly has a fake French passport .
Authorities detained the pair when alera bomb-sniffing dog that the vehicle Garofalo was driving was carrying explosives .
A search yielded no explosives .
Garofalo was charged with illegally transporting aliens into the United States , an activity that U.S. Attorney David Kirby said was funded by Said Atmani , an activist in the Armed Islamic Group and a former roommate of Ressam .
Atmani also is a leading document-forger for the group , Kirby said at a federal court hearing in Burlington , Vt. , on Thursday .
Kirby said there is `` a direct link between -LRB- Garofalo -RRB- and someone who is charged with committing crimes , which appear to be precursors to acts of terrorism in the United States . ''
After Ghani 's arrest in New York on Thursday , authorities said he had traveled to Seattle Dec. 11 under an assumed name .
Ghani returned to New York immediately after Ressam 's Dec. 14 arrest as he tried to enter the United States at Port Angeles , Wash. , about 65 miles northwest of Seattle .
When Ressam was arrested , authorities said , he was carrying a piece of paper with Ghani 's name and Brooklyn phone number .
Ressam and Ghani allegedly planned to travel to Chicago and other cities to raise money for a terrorist organization not named in the federal documents filed Thursday with a federal court in New York .
The indictment of Ghani alleged that a confidential source said Ressam had been assigned by the group to drive the explosive-laden vehicle `` to a parking lot and walk away from it . ''
The indictment said another person later was to retrieve the vehicle .
The car that Ressam allegedly was driving when he was arrested initially was believed to have been carrying common nitroglycerine .
The liquid turned out to be RDX , or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine , a compound used by military forces .
Experts on Wednesday said there was enough RDX in the vehicle to destroy a major building .
