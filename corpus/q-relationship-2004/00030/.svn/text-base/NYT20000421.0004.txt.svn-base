TEMPLE , Texas --
For Gov. George Bush , the unthinkable bloodshed of a year ago was a lesson in neglected values , so his act of remembrance on Thursday was a visit to an elementary school with a special program for promoting those traits .
For Vice President Gore , the killings were as compelling an example as possible of the prevalence and deadliness of firearms , and Thursday 's anniversary was a time to call , once again , in a voice laced with urgency , for tougher gun-control laws .
Twelve months after the fact , the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo. , cast its shadow over the presidential race .
And the different ways in which the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees responded presented a tidy , stark contrast in their beliefs about the roots of , and remedies for , random violence in America .
Bush plugged character education in public schools .
Gore pushed the licensing of handgun owners .
And each candidate took swipes at his rival , jockeying for advantage on an issue that many political analysts believe will be more important in the 2000 elections than ever before .
`` We can pass laws all we want , '' Bush told educators at the Cater Elementary School in Temple , Texas , about an hour 's drive north of Austin .
`` The problem is that government ca n't make people love one another .
`` What government can do , in my judgment , '' Bush said , `` is facilitate decent , honorable folks who understand that we need to teach our children right from wrong .
We need to teach our children character . ''
Gore , speaking to students at Fort Lee High School in New Jersey , said that government can -- and should -- make it more difficult for guns to end up in the hands of destructive people , and that the spate of school shootings over the last two years demanded such an effort .
`` The one thing that all of these events , including Columbine , have in common is that they involve guns in the hands of people that should n't have them , '' Gore said .
`` I think one of the lessons of Columbine is that we have to stand up to the NRA and the gun industry , '' Gore added , referring to the National Rifle Association .
Bush , he said , `` has done what the NRA has wanted . ''
Columbine has intensified a debate over school violence and gun control .
Many Democrats feel their advocacy of gun control reflects the mood of the country and will be rewarded at the polls .
Many Republicans are betting that it will not , and while Bush has indicated a greater receptiveness toward gun control over the last month , he has not wrapped his arms around the issue the way he has with other areas of policy traditionally dominated by Democrats .
He said on Thursday that there were some sensible new restrictions on firearms that he supported .
But his emphasis was elsewhere , as he visited a first-grade classroom in which students participated in a character education program .
It entailed making lists of statements and reading stories that illustrated a chosen value of the month .
April 's was sincerity .
Asked for his own take on the word , Bush told the 20 students that sincerity was a matter of meaning what you say .
`` I 'm sincere when I say I 'm glad to be here in your class , '' Bush said .
He has proposed more than tripling , to $ 25 million from $ 8 million , the federal money dedicated annually to the promotion of character education in public schools .
It is not his sole suggestion for making school safer .
He has promoted legislation to immunize teachers who take disciplinary action against unruly or dangerous students from lawsuits and has pledged that , as president , he would require perpetually dangerous schools to make arrangements for students who wanted to transfer to safer learning environments .
Regarding guns , Bush said that one of the biggest problems was the lax enforcement of regulations , a condemnation of the Clinton administration that was none too implicit .
`` It 's important for the next administration to do something a little differently and enforce laws that are on the books , '' Bush said .
Gore countered that Bush was misportraying the statistics and that laws had been vigorously enforced .
He also shined a harsh spotlight on Bush 's record on gun control in Texas , where Bush signed a 1995 law that permitted Texans who were properly licensed to carry concealed weapons .
Bush also supported subsequent legislation that , to some degree , removed a barrier preventing people from carrying concealed weapons into churches .
`` He overturned the 125-year -old ban on concealed weapons in Texas and than went back for another law to make sure that people could take them into churches and synagogues , '' Gore said .
`` I think that 's pretty out of touch with what most people want . ''
Gore said character education and attention to cultural and moral factors in youth violence were worthy , but were not enough , and mentioned an array of new restrictions on firearms that he supports .
