<br><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: frame construction reflects earliest building
type in district</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>Although the front facade of this building is brick,
this is actually a frame building which likely dates to the 1860s or 1870s.
The two story frame structure is shown on Robinson's 1886 Atlas of Chicago,
the earliest building-outline map of the area. In 1905, the building's
owner, M. Rosenbilt undertook a project to shore the existing frame building
onto a brick foundation and one story structure. The three story structure
was also given a new brick front facade. The project was probably undertaken
to convert the building from being only residential to a store and flats.
The first story facade has remnants of its original cast iron storefront.
The decorative iron tie rods are also intact, on the narrow sign frieze
area above the door and storefront windows. The building has three long
rectangular windows on both the second and third stories. The windows have
simple rectangular lintels, and narrow sills composed of Bedford limestone.
The building has a flat roof, and straight parapet that is flush with the
roof. The parapet has is infill brick, and may have had a cornice. As this
building relates to the area's social history, and the original frame building
can clearly be seen at the east and west facades, it would likely be deemed
as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This one story brick store building was constructed
by J. Wolfer in 1923. It has a flat roof and a parapet that is flat except
for two limestone pointed finials flanking an inverted V shaped small limestone
and brick plate element placed at the center of the pediment. The parapet
also has patterned brickwork with diamond and square limestone details.
There is also a band of three courses of patterned brickwork at the sign
frieze level over the storefronts. The storefronts appear to be intact,
although they have corrugated pull down metal doors that enclose them.
The building reflects the commercial success of W. Maxwell St. in the 1920s,
as businesses continued to be constructed during the period. As the building
relates to the area's social history, and continues to convey its historic
form, character ,and details, it would likely be deemed as a contributing
feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: mixed-use type and double building occupancy

masonry facade</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>Originally constructed as a two story brick dwelling
in 1883, this building was altered in 1909 when it was converted to a three
story factory and storage. At that time it was owned by William H. Farber
and Hyman Wittenberg. They hired architect David S. Klafter to design the
addition and alterations. The result was an eclectic but well crafted W.
Maxwell Street facade. The three story brick facade has a pedimented parapet
with a limestone shield shaped element that has the F &amp; W, Farber and
Wittenberg initials.</font>
<p><font size=+0>On the west side of the facade there is a set of pilasters
that extend from the sign frieze to the lintel level of the third story.
The pilasters frame a triple window at the third story. There is also a
single rectangular window on the east side of the facade. That window opening
is now filled in with brick. Both the single rectangular window opening
and triple window opening on the second story are also now filled in with
brick. Above the third story window openings, at what would be the lintel
line, there is a limestone belt course with moulded coping. Above this
is a frieze of patterned brickwork. Above this is a pediment with limestone
coping over the bay framed by the pilasters. At the flat east side of the
facade, the limestone coping of the pediment extends to a belt course separating
the frieze above the third story from the parapet above it. The pilasters
are square with simple limestone bases and capitals, on and below the capitals
there are carved limestone foliage ornaments. Within the spandrels between
the second and third stories there are two patterned elements of small
squares limestone and brick. This detail forms a square between the single
windows, and a rectangle between the triple windows. There is a thin limestone
belt course beneath the second story windows, and a band of similar limestone
squares beneath this, extending horizontally across the sign frieze area.
The building may not have historically had a storefront. The existing storefront
appears to be a more recent modification. In spite of this change and the
in fill brick in the window openings, the building has good integrity and
would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic
district.</font></dir>

Stein as a two story brick store and dwelling in 1881. In 1903, then owners,
Farber and Wittenberg, who also owned the building next door, hired Alexander
L. Levy to design a one story addition for the building. Since that time
the building had numerous other alterations including the removal of the
third story in 1934.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: earliest residential frame structure (upper
level), Civil War era</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>Although the front facade of this two story building
is brick, this is actually a frame building which likely dates to the 1860s
or 1870s. The two story frame structure is shown on Robinson's 1886 Atlas
of Chicago, the earliest building-outline map of the area. In 1910, the
building's owner D. Steinberg hired architect, J.T. Fortin to design a
two story brick front addition to the frame building. The first story was
likely converted to commercial use at that time. The building has a flat
roof, and simple brick front facade with a limestone belt course at the
sill level of the second story windows. There are two second story window
openings. One has a slightly convex triple window, and the other is a simple
rectangular double hung window. There is a band of decorative brickwork
on the otherwise plain parapet. As this building relates to the area's
social history, and the original frame building can clearly be seen at
the east facades, it would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to
a potential historic district.</font></dir>
</dir>
<font size=+0>Note: A recent review of the interior joists and studs in
the upper story frame structure revealed vertical sawn lumber commonly
used during the Civil War era in the early 1860s. Thus, the building reflects
the earliest housing type on Maxwell Street and its transformation from
a residential to commercial function by the storefront addition after the
turn of the century.</font>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This one story brick store building was designed by
J. T. Fortin for A. Brady and constructed in 1911. It has a flat roof and
a decorative metal parapet composed of trimmed panels. There are two outer
low rectangular panels that flank the center portion of the parapet. The
center portion, extending approximately six inches higher than these outer
panels, is composed of one straight metal element composed of two pairs
of wide rectangular panels flanking a narrow rectangular panel in the center.
Within all of the trimmed panels there are slightly convex X shapes, except
for the narrow center panel which is flat with an applied diamond shape.
The building has two storefronts. One of them has been completely altered.
The other has its original configuration of display windows and recessed
entrance vestibule, and original transom window over the door. Its bulkhead
had been altered and is now filled in with brick. Flanking the two storefronts
are brick pilasters with carved limestone capitals. The building reflects
the increasingly commercial character of W. Maxwell St. in the early 1910s.
As the building relates to the area's social history, and continues to
convey its historic character, it would likely be deemed as a contributing
feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: mixed-use type retains historic character
of Maxwell Street</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This was originally a brick two flat building constructed
by Mrs. Anna McNulty in 1890. In 1912, then owner, A. Brady, who also owned
the building next door, added one story and a new brick facade to the building.
The remaining original part of the 1890 building can still be seen at east
facade. As in the construction of 725 W. Maxwell St., which was undertaken
one year earlier, Brady hired architect J.T. Fortin to design the addition
to this building. Composed of yellow brick with limestone details, the
three story building has a flat roof, and flat parapet. A moulded cornice
divides the second story from the parapet. At the soffit of the cornice
there is a band of dentils. The second and third stories each have two
window openings. One has a slightly convex triple window, and the other
is a simple rectangular double hung window. Patterned brickwork forms a
band that frames the second and third story triple windows, and the same
treatment framing the two single windows. There is also a simple brick
patterned rectangular frame element at the spandrel between the two stories
of triple windows. Two solid rectangular light brick elements pierce the
lower line of the brickwork frame, over the second story window. The second
story triple window opening is intact, however, a double window replaces
the original triple window. There is a moulded limestone belt course between
the second story and the sign frieze. At the first story, there is a storefront
and a side entry to the stairway that leads to the upper stories. This
doorway is flanked by two square pilasters with carved limestone capitals.
These pilasters are identical to those the Fortin designed for 725 W. Maxwell
St., next door. The storefront has its historic configuration, with a recessed
symmetrically placed vestibule. Its bulkhead, however, has been filled
in with brick. In spite of this, the building has good integrity, and as
it also relates to the area's social history, it would likely be deemed
as a contributing feature to a historic district.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: mixed-use type retains historic character
of Maxwell Street; site of one of several storefronts operated by Morrie
Mages on Maxwell Street in his early career his three story brick building
was constructed by V. Hulka as flats in 1888. The vernacular building has
a simple, but eclectic combination of Italianate and Queen Anne style elements.
It has a low pitched gable roof, and a pedimented parapet extending above
the gable end. The second and third stories have Joliet limestone belt
courses above the sill and below the lintels of three rectangular window
openings on both the second and the third stories. The lintels are rectangular
with rounded corners. They have center carved rosettes flanked by curly
incised ornamentation. In addition to the limestone details, the facade
has texture created by horizontal and vertical projecting brickwork. This
includes a brick cornice with crown and soffit dentils. Extending beneath
the cornice are four vertical elements. Two of these are outer pier elements
that enframe the facade including the storefront at the first story. The
other two are decorative elements that divide the three third story windows,
extending only to the level of the second story lintels, where the brick
courses step down to T shape edging. Extending horizontally between these
brick pier elements and beneath the sill of the center third story window
is a band of brickwork with rhythm created by brick header voids.</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>The first story was probably converted to commercial
use at the early part of this century. By the late 1930s, the building
housed a bakery. During the 1950s the storefront was updated. It has asymmetrically
configured display cases with recessed bulkheads composed of small black
and gold mosaic tiles. As the building relates to the area's social history
and conveys its historic form, character and details, it would likely be
deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

in Chicago, rented several storefronts on Maxwell Street throughout his
early career, prior to becoming a well-known success in the sporting goods
business.</font>

<p><font size=+0>SIGNIFICANCE: type reflects commercial growth on Maxwell
Street in the 1920s</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This two story brick commercial building was designed
by Merritt J. Morehouse and constructed for L. Klein in 1920. Morehouse,
who had practiced architecture in Chicago since 1895 was trained at the
University of Illinois and in Paris. The attractive primary facade that
he created for this building is suggestive of Art Deco, though the style
did not fully emerge in Chicago until several years later. The facade is
clad with cream colored terra cotta square tiles. It has a flat roof, and
a flared terra cotta band serves as a simple frieze, flush with the roof
line. There are four Chinese inspired applied terra cotta ornaments symmetrically
placed on the frieze. At the soffit of this frieze, there is a course of
simple of small terra cotta tiles that create a dentil-like band. Above
the lintels of the second story windows, there is and applied moulded band
of the same terra cotta tile panels that are used throughout the facade.
These tiles are also used on applied terra cotta pilasters that divide
the three second story windows, and are beneath the applied moulded band.
The pilasters have simple rectangular bases and stylized lotus capitals.
On the terra cotta tile lintels above each of the three second story window
openings there are two symmetrically placed simple medallions with X shaped
motifs. A similar element is used on the sign frieze. The second story
windows are currently covered with boards. Historic photographs reveal
that each of the three opening has a set of triple windows, and an upper
muntin bars creates a transom above each window. A storefront update in
the 1940s created straight display windows on angle from the three storefront
doors, and also brought the windows down to floor level. The building reflects
the commercial growth of the area in the early 1920s. As it also continues
to reflect is historic form and details, it would likely be deemed as a
contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

building types in district</font>
<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This long rectangular building, located on the southwest
corner of W. Roosevelt Rd. and S. Union Ave., is in fact an original three
story building at 707-09 Roosevelt Rd., with the later addition of 701-05
W. Roosevelt Rd. The original building was designed by Alexander L. Levy
as a store and loft for Berry and Benson in 1916. In 1936, Levy was again
hired by Berry and Benson for a two story addition. It is likely that construction
did not commence until 1938, when a new permit was taken out to make the
addition into a three story, rather than two story building. The two buildings
are almost identical, although the original 707-09 W. Roosevelt Rd. building
has more ornamentation. This may have been due to the financial constraints
of the late 1930s, when the addition was undertaken. Both the original
building and the addition have flat roofs, and parapets with shallow center
pediments. Both have four sets of triple windows divided by long vertical
panels that extend from the sill level of the second story windows to lintel
level of the third story windows.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The 707-09 W. Roosevelt Rd. building is red brick with
white terra cotta and limestone details. Its parapet has a gently sloping
center triangular pediment, emphasized by white terra cotta trim. Flanking
the pedimented portion of the parapet wall are a pair of terra cotta ornaments
of double square inverted U shapes over small terra cotta squares. In the
center of the pediment is a terra cotta medallion ornament. Additional
white terra cotta elements on this facade are placed at the caps and bases
of the three center vertical panels that divide the windows. All of these
details are simple versions of stock Sullivanesque terra cotta ornamentation.
There is a limestone moulded frieze that extends horizontally over all
four sets of windows.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The 701-05 W. Roosevelt Rd. addition is brown brick, and
is essentially a simplified version of the 707-09 W. Roosevelt Rd. building.
Its parapet also has a gentle slope with a center pediment, but this is
a segmental pediment. It has white terra cotta trim and with three simple
crest ornaments, flanking both sides and placed in the center of the pediment.
A long horizontal storefront unifies the original building and the addition.
This storefront has black pigmented architectural structural glass, possibly
dating to the 1938 addition or the 1940s. The black glass extends along
sign frieze and beneath the series of flush storefront windows that now

<dir><font size=+0>This two story brick building was originally a one story
coffee shop designed by Dubin and Eisenberg for M. Goodman and constructed
in 1923. Two years later, M. Goodman hired Dubin and Eisenberg to enlarge
the building into a two story brick commercial building. That project probably
included the construction of the existing facade. The building is an example
of the Baroque Revival style more commonly used in the design of palace
movie theaters which had achieved popularity at the time.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The brick building has a flat roof, and its facade is
enlivened by cream colored terra cotta details. The most ornate part of
the building is a fanciful symmetrically placed applied terra cotta surround
that extends from the center doorway beyond the second story and projects
several feet above the parapet. This surround element has an ogee arch
above the door's rounded lintel, another ogee arch over a single arched
second story balcony window, and the parapet element is square flanked
by twisted pilasters, and topped by a pointed finial. The entire three
story terra cotta element is covered with applied ornamentation including
swags, garlands, and wreath and other floral motifs. One of the most interesting
elements of the terra cotta surround element is a pair of cherub-like figures
used as brackets or supports to the doorway's arched lintel.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The second story of the building has two sets of triple
arched balconette windows. These have cream colored terra cotta surrounds,
and metal grillwork faux balconies. A terra cotta belt course separates
the second story from the parapet. On the parapet wall, flanking the terra
cotta surround element is a pair of oval ornaments with a ruffled edge
treatment. There are twisted pilasters flanking the outer edges of the
parapet wall. These are topped with pointed finials. Beneath these pilasters
are square projections from the belt course, and beneath this is another
set of pilasters. These pilasters are square and extend down to the level
of the floors of the balconettes, where they rest on squared bases. These
bases extend down to a belt course at the sign frieze line of the building
and beneath this is a set of the cherub-like figures identical to those
applied to the entrance door surround. The storefront has been altered,
however, the building retains good integrity and would likely be deemed
as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir><font size=+0>This three story brick building was designed by Alexander
L. Levy for B. Hirschfinkle and constructed in 1917. Constructed one year
after the building at 707-09 W. Roosevelt Rd. and designed by the same
architect, this owner may have wanted a that would be similar to, but more
ornate than the structure located a few lots to its east. This three story
red-brown brick building also has a flat roof and parapet trimmed with
white terra cotta. This building, however, has an ornate Sullivanesque
cluster focus-piece symmetrically applied to and projecting slightly above
the flat parapet. On the parapet wall, beneath and flanking the focus-piece,
there are two rows of six small square ornaments. Flanking these small
ornaments at the outer corners of the parapet wall are a pair of larger
square ornaments, each with an interior squared floral ornament. These
Sullivanesque stock details were made by the Midland Terra Cotta Company.
This is a fairly early use of this type of ornamentation, which became
most popular in 1922 or 1923 (Garner 1991, 162-182). There are some additional
simple terra cotta details including frames around the second and third
story windows, and rectangular panels in the spandrels between the windows
of those upper stories. There is also a terra cotta trim frame around the
storefront. The storefront itself has been recently altered. In spite of
this, the building conveys its historic form, character and most of its
details, and would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential
historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>The St. Francis Assisi Catholic Church has a long and
interesting history in the area. In 1853, St. Francis Assisi established
one of Chicago's first German churches, at Clinton and Mather Streets.
In 1866, the congregation had outgrown the building, and a new building
was constructed near the location of the existing building, on the corner
of W. Twelfth St. (now W. Roosevelt Rd.) and S. Newberry Ave. The building
was completed in 1875, but was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1904.
The original sanctuary and altars were saved, and they were incorporated
into the design for the existing building by architect Joseph Molitor in
1904. A Bohemian immigrant, Molitor was responsible for several other Chicago
Catholic churches including Sts. Cyril and Methodius Roman Catholic Church,
St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church, and Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church
(Sinkevitch 1993, 394).</font>
<p><font size=+0>St. Francis Assisi Church has essentially remained intact
since 1904, however, it did have to be moved thirty two feet for the widening
of W. Twelfth St. (W. Roosevelt Rd.) in 1917. The building is inspired
by churches of central Europe. It has a prominent tower with steeple that
intersects a two story gabled brick and stone building, with the gable
end and tower facing W. Roosevelt. The entrance to the building projects
from the brick tower and has a classical triangular pedimented portio,
with a prominent arched doorway. There are two smaller secondary arched
doorways flanking the tower on the building's front facade. Above these
are rounded arched rectangular windows. On the tower, above the pediment
is a grand arched window with a floral pattern of divided stained glass
lights. As the building good integrity and relates to the early German
history of the area, it would likely be deemed as contributing feature
to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir><font size=+0>Constructed for Dr. C. Lichtenberg in 1916, this corner
brick building was designed as a two story store and office by architect
J.T. Fortin. The building could be characterized as a "Two Part Commercial
Block" structure with a flat roof (Longstreth 1987, 24). It has two primary
facades: one on S. Halsted Street and one on W. Roosevelt Rd., with a corner
entrance into the first floor store. It continues to house offices in the
second story. Both facades of the red brick structure retain all of their
white terra cotta details above the storefront level. In the center of
the parapet walls of both primary facades, there is a rectangular terra
cotta element that has the Lichtenberg name in applied letters. The building
received storefront modifications in the late 1930s. Black pigmented architectural
glass extending the sign frieze area across both facades still exists from
this storefront alteration. The store has a small recessed vestibule space
with a terrazzo floor bearing the name and logo of Turner Brothers which
may date to the 1940s or early 1950s. The building has good integrity and
would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic
district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This handsome Art Deco style facade was constructed
in 1928 onto an existing building. In 1880, a frame structure was built
on the site, and in 1912 a one story brick barn was built in the very back
of the lot. In 1920, then owner Julius Rosenberg hired Dubin and Eisenberg
to build a large addition at the rear of the original frame structure.
In 1926, the front frame structure was demolished, and in 1928, Rosenberg
commissioned architect Joseph W. Cohen to design new three story front
extending 25 feet from the 1920 addition. The reason that Rosenberg hired
Cohen instead of Dubin and Eisenberg is unknown, however, he may have been
impressed with J.W. Cohen's Congregation Anshe Roumania synagogue, built
southwest of the project area two years earlier.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The front facade of this brick building is clad with cream
colored terra cotta. A shallow parapet wall extends above the building's
flat roof. The facade has classically inspired fluted pilasters, vertically
dividing the second and third story windows, topped with abstract geometric
square ornaments in lieu of capitals. The lintels and sills of all the
second and third story windows have chevrons and other Deco motifs. There
are three terra cotta floral medallions, each placed symmetrically on the
spandrel between the second and third story windows.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The building retains much of its original 1928 storefront,
as well as evidence of minor changes dating to approximately 1940. It sited
just south of an alley, and the 1928 front addition wrapped the facade
around the northern corner to give the building a finished appearance.
Many of the elements of the original 1928 storefront are intact on that
northern corner of the facade. This includes remnants of the original green
marble bulkhead, and original Art Deco style metal grillwork in the windows.
Remnants of the 1928 storefront also include cream colored granite piers
extending vertically from the outer section of the bulkheads, framing the
display windows. These granite elements still exist at both the northern
corner and the primary Halsted Street facade. It is evident that the Arcaded
style storefront, including the geometrically configured display cases
and recessions for interior case reflector lighting, also date to the 1928
storefront. Changes to the doorway and the display case area at the left
side of the doorway to make the vestibule area appear asymmetrical are
likely to have been made in the late 1930s or early 1940s. At this date
the porcelain enamel bulkhead and ceramic tile vestibule floor are likely
to have also been added. The building's long history of additions and alterations
are consistent with a broader context for the area. Additional research
on the commercial history associated with structure could shed light on
the reasons for the major alterations, particularly the 1928 facade addition.
As the building continues to strongly convey its appearance from that period,
it has good integrity and would likely be deemed as a contributing feature
to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This four story red pressed brick commercial building
was likely constructed in the early 1880s, and appears to be the structure
indicated on Robinson's 1886 Atlas of Chicago, the earliest building-outline
map of the area. The building could be characterized as the "Stacked Vertical
Block," a type of commercial architecture that was commonly used between
the 1850s and the 1880s (Longstreth 1987, 76). It has a flat roof, and
its primary facade has square window openings on the fourth story, and
long narrow rectangular windows at the third and second story levels. The
windows have Joliet limestone lintels. In the spandrels between the second
and third story windows there are patterned brick panels composed of angled
headers. The fourth story square windows are divided by projecting brick
pier elements with shallow stepped down courses beneath the sill level,
which is repeated to form the recessions for the window openings at the
third story level.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The existing storefront dates to 1951. It is the Open
Faced Front style, which offered the vestibule of the Arcaded Front, but
more simple straight planes for the display window cases. These cases are
on recessed bulkheads, which also became stylish in the late 1940s and
early 1950s. The bulkheads are porcelain enamel, as is the cream colored
sign frieze, also added during the 1951 storefront update. The terrazzo
vestibule floor also dates to that time, and bears the name of the store
then located in this building, Wexler Brothers. Although the storefront
was added after 1944, it reflects the continuum of the area's commercial
history. As the building also continues to retain its essential form and
details, it would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential
historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This four story building was originally constructed
in 1889, however, its existing brick facade was the resulted of an alteration
conducted some time around 1915. The building was originally constructed
by Samuel D. Lewis as a store and flats of its existing dimensions. Remnants
of the original cast iron storefront still flank both sides of what was
the 1889 entry to the stairway to the residential upper level of the building.
These box column and mullion elements now flank the southernmost display
case window of the storefront. The alteration of the storefront and construction
of the existing brick facade were likely done c. 1915 to convert the building
to an entirely commercial use. At the time, the upper apartments were likely
converted to warehouse functions. Though the second, third and fourth story
windows are currently boarded up, historic photographs reveal that the
building has three-part Chicago windows at the second and third story levels.
Though this structure would not be classified as a high style building,
it reflects the influence of the Chicago School to the city's more modest,
simple and smaller scale commercial structures during the period. The existing
storefront is the Arcaded Front style. It has a symmetrical deeply recessed
entry vestibule with geometrically configured window cases and a tile vestibule
floor with the store name, "Original Goldberg." The facade also has a ghost
sign reading "Lieberman and Sons." Though the architect and exact date
of the existing facade are not known, the alteration is consistent with
the commercial history themes of the area. As the building continues to
convey its essential form and character, it is likely that it would be
deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>While only minimal information about this building was

is a structure that went through a transformation similar to 1222 S. Halsted
St., next door. Remnants of Bedford limestone and remaining cast iron storefront
details reveal that this building was originally constructed in the 1880s.
In the 1910s, its existing three story brick facade was constructed with
a center entry door to the stairway leading to residential section of the
building. The building has a flat roof, and historically had a cornice
which no longer exists. The storefronts were converted to a double Arcaded
Front in the 1920s or early 1930s. Today 1228 S. Halsted St. retains its
historic 1920s or 30s Arcaded storefront. It retains much of its historic
fabric, including the rough stucco vaulted ceiling, symmetrically placed
deep vestibule with geometrically configured display windows, and ceramic
tile vestibule floor. Many of the joints of the display windows are still
exposed glass without mullions. The bulkheads are green marble. Within
the display cases there are recessions for interior case reflector lighting.
There are also some remnants of frosted glass with Art Deco motifs. The
1226 S. Halsted Street storefront was altered again in 1941. Its open streamlined
design reflects the transition of storefront design into the Open Faced
Front style. The terrazzo vestibule floor has the name of the store in
this location when the 1941 storefront alteration was made, Maremont, and
a simple linear arrow. If the storefront updates are considered as significant
alterations, the building has good integrity and would likely be deemed
as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font>

spelled. The storefront also dates to 1946. It has a symmetrically placed
doorway flanked by Open Face Front windows that curve at the threshold
of the vestibule. The terrazzo vestibule floor has the Karoll's Mens Shops
name with outline border and two simple lines connecting the logo with
the doorway. The bulkhead is pigmented architectural glass that has simply
been painted over. All of the original 1946 Karoll's Mens Shop interior
furnishings are in-tact. ...the building's facade and storefront...have
good integrity. As the building is a good example of Art Moderne commercial
architecture, and shows the pattern by which locally prominent chain stores
were still opening in the neighborhood in the mid-1940s, the building would
likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir><font size=+0>This two story brick building was originally built as
a one story store and dwelling by the Chicago Hebrew Mission in 1912. The
original building was designed by Otto Kaiser. In 1924, Levy and Klein
were hired to build a one story brick addition. The building has three
square panels of patterned header bricks divided by two panels of rectangular
brick outlines on the parapet wall extending between the second story windows
and above the building's flat roof. Historic photographs reveal that there
are Chicago windows at the second story. These and the historic sign frieze
element are currently covered up. As the building is related to the area's
social history, and the essential form and upper level details are intact,
it would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This three story brick building was originally an 1890s
two story structure. In 1919, the owners, Stressan and Becker hired architect
J. L. Stern to build an additional story and new facade. The simple yellow
brick commercial building drew inspiration from the Classical Revival style.
The second and third story windows are divided into a center larger window
flanked by two narrow rectangular windows. Two vertical panels capped by
simple bracket forms extend from the bottom of the second story to the
top of the third story, acting as divisions to the windows. The building's
roof is flat, and facade has a parapet that steps up at the center. At
the top center area of the parapet, there is a limestone relieve shield
ornament. At the top of the outer lower part of the parapet wall there
is a classical urn finial at each end. The building's storefront was updated
in 1933 with a recessed vestibule that has a symmetrically placed doorway.
The ceramic vestibule entry floor remains, but the bulkheads and windows
have been altered. As the building conveys its historic form, character
and details, it would likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a historic
district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This two story store building was designed by Dubin
and Eisenberg and constructed by Adolph Breyer in 1928. It is an Art Deco
style building, and has a flat roof. Constructed of brick, the building's
primary facade is clad with Bedford limestone, and is a clean plane with
a single long rectangular second story window opening. Beneath the window,
the sign frieze is an unadorned limestone background on which the Breyer's
letter sign is applied. Extending above the sign frieze, the facade is
enlivened by carved ornamentation. The emphasis on verticality that is
often articulated in Art Deco buildings is expressed by jagged fluted piers
that extend from the sign frieze to the roof line at both extreme outer
ends of the second story facade. These piers step down, creating chamfered
corners, and framing the straight parapet wall, which is only broken by
a center curved projection on which an applied inverted trifoliate ornament
is placed. Though the parapet itself is clean and unadorned, it is composed
of flush triangular and inverted pentagonal shapes. The building's most
interesting ornamentation is a long lintel band above the second story
window, and two engaged curved and fluted shafts on both sides of the window.
The carved lintel detail has a long band of strapwork composed of a curly
line that extends horizontally twisting with a band of inverted Vs. Within
the intersecting areas in which the curve is on top, there area oval ornaments
which look like a series of eyes. Above each of the four eye ornaments,
are sunbursts of chevrons and Deco foliage motifs.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The building's storefront was updated in 1950, possibly
by the Dubin firm. It is a classic example of a high style storefront of
the period. It is the Open Faced Front style, which offered simple straight
planes for the display window cases. These cases are on recessed bulkheads,
which are composed of green marble. The display window cases are also finished
at the top. They have green marble upper trim, and project from receding
green marble walls. This projection allows for lighting at along the top
portions of the vestibule wall, including back-lighting for the Breyer's
sign which is placed on top of the southern window display case. The Breyer's
name is also included in a front horizontal band of the terrazzo vestibule
flooring, and three addition vertical bands extend to the door. The window
at the second story of the building is filled with glass block, which was
probably done during the 1950 update as well. This building conveys the
commercial architecture design approaches of the late 1920s and those of
the early 1950s used to attract customers, particularly relevant because
it was always the same store. The building has good integrity, and would
likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir><font size=+0>This two story brick Italianate style building was constructed
in the early-to-mid 1870s, before building permits were required in the
area. In 1880, its owner, John Livingston obtained a permit to construct
a frame shed at the rear of the lot. Both the brick building and frame
shed are shown on the Robinson's 1886 Atlas of Chicago, the earliest building-outline
map of the area. In 1916, the frame shed was demolished and George Dubin
was hired to design a two story brick rear addition. He did not change
the second story facade, or 1870s stairway entry to the second story, however,
he may have updated the storefront with a recessed symmetrically placed
vestibule. The vestibule floor is composed of terrazzo. The bulkheads which
are composed of glazed tile were probably updated in the late 1930s or
early 1940s. The second story has three long rectangular windows with rounded
lintels that each have a keystone. The entry to the second story is flanked
by long pilasters that extend beyond what became the sign frieze. The transom
window above the doorway with divided lights is well intact. The building
has a flat roof, and is missing its cornice. The brick and limestone has
been completely painted over. While these changes have diminished the building's
integrity, it still conveys its historic appearance. The building would
likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

with rear frame barn constructed c. 1870. The 1320 S. Halsted St. building
has had several alterations including a 1926 one story brick addition.
The building became a Jewish delicatessen, Leavitt's Restaurant in the
1920s, and now is a kosher hot dog stand operated by the same family. The
building connecting 1320 S. Halsted St. with 808 W. Maxwell Street was
likely constructed in 1926, when the addition was made on the S. Halsted
building. The 808 W. Maxwell St. building, one of the few structures in
the neighborhood with a gable roof has a stucco W. Maxwell St. facade.
Its intact frame facades are clearly underneath the stucco. The frame north
facade can be seen from the alley. There is a possibility that a historic
facade may also be beneath the vertical metal siding that sheaths the 1320
S. Halsted St. building. As this building relates to the area's social
history, and still retains early historic fabric, it would likely be deemed
as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

ornate limestone crowns with keystones and incised details. These crowns
rest on simple square capitals on projecting brick piers, framing the windows.

above the heavier limestone belt course, under which several bands of receding
brick courses extend. The third story windows are divided by four pilasters,
which form three rounded arches at the fourth story. The third story windows
are not framed as those of the second story are, however, they have pedimented
limestone crowns. The pilasters have engaged square brick bases, smooth
projecting rectangular brick shafts, and square brick and limestone capitals.
Symmetrically placed within each of the four rounded arches is a square
window. An Arcaded storefront was added in 1931. It has a geometric zig-zag
configuration, of clean planes without mullions.The building conveys its

Hoffman as store and flats in 1922. Designed by Levy and Klein, the handsome
Tudor Revival style building has limestone details that contrast against
the chocolate brown brick. The building is located on the corner of S.
Halsted St. and O'Brien St., and has a primary facade on both streets.
The second and third story window bays are divided by limestone quoins
which extend from horizontal limestone belt courses beneath the second
story windows and above the third story windows. The bays have groupings
of three windows each. In the spandrels between the second and third story
windows, there are limestone elements that follow the vertical pattern
of the mullions. In the outer square brick panels formed by these vertical
elements are square limestone elements with strapwork ornamentation. Extending
above the belt course that separates the fourth story from the parapet,
additional limestone elements follow the vertical pattern established by
the quoins. These culminate in paired pinnacle-like engaged finials on
the parapet. Between the each pair of these vertical elements are three
symmetrically placed small square limestone elements. The doors leading
to the stairways to the residential levels of the building are framed in
limestone, and have carved shield and foliage ornamentation. In 1938, the
existing storefront was added to the first floor. It has a deeply recessed
vestibule and a symmetrically placed double door entryway. The storefront
display windows have a geometric zig-zag configuration that curves at the
threshold of the vestibule. The display windows have narrow bulkheads of
pigmented architectural glass. The vestibule floor has a multi-colored

is an excellent high style example of Art Deco, during the period in which
it was reaching popularity, just before the Great Depression. Unlike the
more traditional commercial buildings of the area, its stories and window
groupings are not divided by band courses, pilasters, panels or quoins.
The second story has a long horizontal center window flanked by two rectangular
windows, and the building has an arched opening at the first story with
an arcaded storefront. The building's face is a clean plane with applied
ornamentation. It has a cornice and lintel over the long center second
story window providing two prominent sculptural bands of terra cotta. Both
of these horizontal elements have combined stylized geometric chevron forms
with foliated tendril motifs. The storefront is a classic example of the
Arcaded type that was popularized during the 1920s. It has a deeply recessed
vestibule a symmetrically placed double entry with vaulted ceilings. The
display windows have a geometric zig-zag configuration and a hexagonal
center island window. Beneath the display windows are molded green terra
cotta bulkheads. The flooring is terrazzo with tri-colored geometric motifs.
Within the interiors of the display windows there are recessions for interior

The light brick building has a flat roof with a shallow parapet. Its primary
facade is long, with six single square windows on both the second and third
stories. The windows are divided by a series of seven pilasters that extend
from a limestone belt course beneath the second story windows and a several
project bands of brick courses above the third story windows. The pilasters
have limestone bases and limestone ionic columns. Symmetrically placed
at the center of the facade is the doorway leading to the stairway to the
residential levels of the building, with an arched transom window. Most
of the architectural details of this entryway have been covered. The building's
existing storefront at 1253 S. Halsted was added in the early 1940s. It
has a deeply recessed vestibule and straight windows which were thought
to provide better visual access than the earlier zig-zag and other geometric
configurations of display windows. The windows curve at the threshold of
the vestibule. Flush beneath the windows are porcelain enamel bulkheads.
The storefront at 1251 S. Halsted dates to the mid-to-late 1950s. It has
an Open Face Front with straight planes that gently angle from the doorway.
The display windows have narrow recessed porcelain enamel bulkheads. Both
vestibules have terrazzo floors, and 1253 S. Halsted has the name Colby's

<dir><font size=+0>This three story brick building was designed by Oldfest
and Williams for the F.W. Woolworth Company in 1927. Oldfest and Williams
were commissioned for a number of Chicago commercial and apartment buildings
in the 1920s including the 1211 N. LaSalle Blvd. Building, which now has
a Richard Haas mural (Sinkevitch 1993, 167). A $100,000 construction project,
the Woolworth's was one of the area's most expensive buildings. The building
has a flat roof, and has primary facades on both S. Halsted and W. 13th
streets. It is composed of yellow brick and Bedford limestone details,
however, most of the details are on the S. Halsted St. facade, and the
first bay of the W. 13th St. facade extending from the S. Halsted St. corner.
These details include a band course extending between the sign frieze and
the sills of the second story windows, and a narrow limestone cornice.
At the second story, flanking the double windows on the S. Halsted St.
facade, and one set of triple windows on the W. 13th St. facade are square
limestone details. Within each square ornament is a concave round plate
serving as the background for a center applied carved rosette.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Several remnants of the original Woolworth’s store still
exist. Ornamental columns and capitals and a coffered ceiling from Woolworths
are in the interior of 1301 S. Halsted St. Details of the original Woolworths
storefront include pink granite dados which have limestone piers extending
to the sign frieze. The storefront was converted into two separate storefronts
in the early-to-mid 1940s, when Woolworths probably sold the building.
Both of the existing storefronts are the Open Faced Front style, with simple
straight display window cases within a recessed vestibule. The 1301 S.
Halsted St. windows are on porcelain enamel bulkheads, and the floor is
terrazzo and has the DeKoven Drug name. The 1303 S. Halsted St. storefront
has porcelain enamel bulkheads and casings around structural piers. It
also has terrazzo flooring, with the Lane's store name. As the building
has good integrity and reflects the trend of chain stores opening in the
area, including national chains in the 1920s, it would be deemed as a contributing
feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This two story building was designed by Theodore Duesing
as a department store for owner F. Zuttermeister in 1899. Located on the
southeast corner of S. Halsted St. and W. Maxwell, the building has a flat
roof and two primary facades. It could be characterized as a "Two Part
Commercial Block" structure (Longstreth 1987, 24). Its second story windows
are divided into groups of two by vertical projecting brick panels that
extend from a limestone belt course above the sign frieze to the cornice
line. A second limestone belt course extends across the sills and across
the brick panels. Beneath this projecting limestone belt course is a band
of egg and dart molding, and a band of dentils. The lower portion of the
brick panels extend down beneath the belt course to double curved limestone
modillions that rest on the other limestone belt course running above the
sign frieze Applied to this lower belt course is metal trim that was added
in 1925, when the storefronts were also updated. The metal band has pressed
foliage applied to it. There is also ornamental metalwork around some of
the W. Maxwell St. storefront windows. The 1329 S. Halsted St. storefront
was updated in 1934, and it retains its ceramic tile vestibule floor and
wooden double door. The storefront at 1333 S. Halsted was updated in the
1950s and has angular display window cases and a ceramic tile floor. As
this building was a department store, it relates to the area's social history.
The building conveys its historic form, character and details, it would
likely be deemed as a contributing feature to a historic district.</font></dir>

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This two story brick building was constructed by the
S. S. Kresge Company as a store and offices in 1926. A Classical Revival
style building with a flat roof, it is composed of warm brown brick and
limestone details. The primary facade has five rectangular windows divided
by six applied limestone vertical panels that extend from a belt course
at sill level to a limestone frieze beneath the cornice. This flat limestone
frieze is plain except for the Kresge name, which is incised above the
center window. Applied to this frieze are square caps extending from the
limestone panels. The square caps over the four center vertical panels
have concave carved circles. Above and applied to the frieze is a shallow
moulded cornice. On the brick parapet, above the cornice are six rectangular
applied limestone elements, placed directly above the limestone vertical
panels and square caps. Similar to the caps, the two outer rectangular
limestone elements are unadorned. Each of the four center rectangular panel
elements serve as frames to carved classical urns in bas relief. The parapet
wall is flat. Both of the building's two storefronts were updated in 1938.
Both are identical and intact, however, the 1335 S. Halsted still retains
its double wooden doors while 1337 S. Halsted does not. These are Arcaded
store fronts with deeply recessed vestibules and display windows that have
a geometric zig-zag configuration. They both have porcelain enamel bulkheads
and terrazzo flooring with three stripes leading to the store's doorway.
As the building has good integrity and reflects the trend of chain stores
opening in the area, including national chains in the 1920s, it would be
deemed as a contributing feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<dir><font size=+0>This three story brick building was designed by Maurice
Spitzer and constructed in 1908. The owner, A. Warsawsky was the mason
for the construction. The building, which has a flat roof, is located on
the northeast corner of S. Halsted St. and W. Liberty St. Its S. Halsted
Street facade and one bay of the W. Liberty St. facade are clad with limestone.
The building is classically inspired. A set of long vertical pilasters
flank the window groupings of the S. Halsted St. facade and the one bay
of double windows on the W. Liberty St. facade that is clad with limestone.
The rectangular pilasters extend from a band course at sill level to the
cornice line. Beneath the pilasters are ornately carved modillions. The
pilasters have plain capitals and bases. The limestone facades have rounded
arched windows on the third story. The windows have limestone crowns with
keystones resting on rectangular limestone pilasters that frame the windows.
The pilasters have square bases resting on the entablature above the second
story windows. This entablature includes a narrow moulded cornice, with
soffits of egg-and-dart moulding. Beneath this is a plain frieze and architrave
over the second story windows. The original architectural treatment to
the buildings parapet has been altered. There is now infill light brick
at the upper level of the facade. There is little evidence of the historic
storefront. In spite of these changes, the building conveys its historic

a simple building, with a flat roof, and its primary facade has an ashlar

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>This building was constructed as a frame church for
the German United Evangelical Zion’s congregation in 1863. In 1905 or 1906
the Church which became the First Roumanian Congregation under Rabbi Commissari
(Lakeside City Directory, 1907). In 1935, the building became the Gethsemane
Missionary Baptist Church. The exterior of the building may have received
its brick veneer at the time. A new brick front facade, on S. Union Ave.,
was constructed in 1944. The building has a gable roof, and the front facade
has a parapet that extends above the gable end. A pentagonal projection
extends from the center of the triangular parapet. Beneath this projection,
there is a crucifix in brickwork. The crucifix is located directly above
what is probably an original arched window beneath the brick veneer. This
is the only window at the third story level. The first and second stories
windows of the front facade have pointed arched window openings. There
are three symmetrically placed windows on the third story and two windows
flanking the front entry on the first story. All of the windows have been
filled with glass block and the arched openings have been filled in with
brick. The windows on the side facade have rounded arched windows. They
too have been filled with glass block, and the rounded arched openings
have been filled with brick.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The building's interior strongly conveys its historic
character. It has an upper balcony and lower main floor both facing the
altar, which must have adapted well to the building's conversion to a synagogue,
as the traditional synagogue form had an upper gallery for the women. There
are narrow interior structural columns supporting the balcony. It is likely
that the original frame building is beneath the brick veneer. As this building
conveys its historic character, particularly in its interior, and relates
to the area's social history, it would likely be deemed as a contributing
feature to a potential historic district.</font></dir>

<p><font size=+0>This four story brick building was constructed on the
corner of S. Halsted St. and Dussold Street, (now W. 12th Place) in 1881
as store and flats. Although most of the W. 12th Place part of the corner
building has good integrity, approximately 30 feet of the entire four stories
fronting on S. Halsted St. was demolished, and a one story store was recently
added. This alteration was done without sensitivity to the historic building.
As the historic S. Halsted St. facade no longer exists and the building
has poor integrity, it would likely be deemed as a non-contributing feature
to a potential historic district.</font>

<p><font size=+0>This one story commercial structure was originally a three
story brick store and loft building designed by Levy and Klein in 1922.
In the 1930s and 1940s storefronts were altered. Today, the only remaining
historic fabric is terrazzo flooring in the 1229 and 1233 S. Halsted Street
storefront vestibules. The long one story structure is clad with vertical
metal siding. Although both terrazzo floors have interesting designs (1233
is a stylized Art Deco graphic), the building retains no integrity whatsoever.
It would be deemed as a non-contributing feature to a potential historic
district.</font>

<p><font size=+0>This one story brick commercial building was constructed
in 1951. As it has no architectural merit and was constructed after the
National Register's 1944 cut-off date, it would be deemed as a non-contributing
feature to a potential historic district.</font>
