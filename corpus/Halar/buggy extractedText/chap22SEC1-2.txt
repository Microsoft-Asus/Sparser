THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION

 

 Field research helped Darwin frame his view of life



 

 The Origin of Species developed two main points: the occurrence of evolution and natural selection as its mechanism



 

 Examples of natural selection provide evidence of evolution



 

 Other evidence of evolution pervades biology



 

 What is theoretical about the Darwinian view of life?



We have set the scene for the Darwinian revolution. Natural theology still dominated the intellectual climate as the 19th century dawned. A few clouds of doubt about the permanence of species were beginning to gather, but no one could have forecast the thundering storm just over the horizon.

Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was born in Shrewsbury in western England. Even as a boy he had a consuming interest in nature. When he was not reading nature books, he was fishing, hunting, and collecting insects. Darwin's father, an eminent physician, could see no future for a naturalist and sent Charles to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Only 16 years old at the time, Charles found medical school boring and distasteful. He left Edinburgh without a degree and shortly thereafter enrolled at Christ College at Cambridge University, with the intent of becoming a clergyman. At that time in Great Britain, most naturalists and other scientists belonged to the clergy, and nearly all saw the world in the context of natural theology. Darwin became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Reverend John Henslow, professor of botany at Cambridge. Soon after Darwin received his B.A. degree in 1831, Professor Henslow recommended the young graduate to Captain Robert FitzRoy, who was preparing the survey ship Beagle for a voyage around the world. Darwin would pay his own way and serve as a conversation companion to the young captain. FitzRoy chose Darwin because of his education and because he was of the same social class and about the same age as the captain.
