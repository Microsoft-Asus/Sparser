WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The U.S. government on Friday added two Colombians to its list of 524 individuals and companies suspected of drug trafficking and banned from doing business in this country .
The two , Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya and Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia , are responsible for huge volumes of drugs that have entered the United States , the Treasury Department said .
By adding the alleged drug kingpins to its list of `` specially designated narcotics traffickers , '' Treasury blocked their access to any assets they may have in the United States and also barred U.S. companies from doing business with them .
Treasury also added to the list one individual and five businesses that it said are acting as fronts for the North Valle drug cartel in Colombia .
In a statement , Treasury described Henao as a leader of one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups that comprise the North Valle cartel and Ramirez as an overlord of the infamous Cali cartel .
Colombian President Andres Pastrana , an avid supporter of extraditing drug kingpins to the United States , this month signed an order clearing the way for Orlandez Gamboa to stand trial in Manhattan .
Gamboa , who allegedly heads a drug cartel based in Barranquilla on Colombia 's Caribbean coast , could become the third Colombian extradited to the United States since the country lifted its extradition ban .
President Clinton in 1995 authorized certain government agencies to apply economic sanctions against Colombian drug cartels .
The action taken Friday brings the total number of businesses and individuals whose assets have been blocked under that order to 532 .
The list now includes nine alleged kingpins from Colombian cartels .
Henao and Ramirez are not on a newer list , compiled by the White House , of a dozen foreign nationals identified as drug kingpins and subject to asset seizure and other financial penalties .
All 12 of those on the list , presented to Congress in June , were already under indictment ; some of the six Mexicans are in jail in their home country .
The list also includes a Burmese warlord , a Chinese national operating in Southeast Asia , two people from St. Kitts - Nevis and two from Nigeria .
Treasury officials have said they doubt the alleged drug lords kept assets in their names in the United States that could be frozen , and hoped the list would lay the groundwork for cutting off their financial resources .
