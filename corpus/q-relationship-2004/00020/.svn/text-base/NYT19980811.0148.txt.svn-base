-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- While the end of the Cold War transformed the political landscape of Europe , it did little to ameliorate India 's security concerns .
The rise of China and continued strains with Pakistan made the 1980s and 1990s a greatly troubling period for India .
At the global level , the nuclear-weapons states showed no signs of moving decisively toward a world free of atomic danger .
Instead , the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- was extended indefinitely and unconditionally in 1995 , perpetuating the existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of five countries busily modernizing their nuclear arsenals .
In 1996 , after they had conducted more than 2,000 tests , a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty -LRB- CTBT -RRB- was opened for signature , following two and a half years of negotiations in which India participated actively .
This treaty , alas , was neither comprehensive nor related to disarmament but rather devoted to ratifying the nuclear status quo .
India 's options had narrowed critically .
India had to ensure that its nuclear option , developed and safeguarded over decades , was not eroded by self-imposed restraint .
Such a loss would place the country at risk .
Faced with a difficult decision , New Delhi realized that its lone touchstone remained national security .
The nuclear tests it conducted this year on May 11 and 13 were not only inevitable but a continuation of policies from almost the earliest years of independence .
India 's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic tenet : that the country 's national security in a world of nuclear proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in exercise of the principle of equal and legitimate security for all .
In 1947 , when a free India took its rightful place in the world , both the nuclear age and the Cold War had already dawned .
Instead of aligning with either bloc , India rejected the Cold War paradigm and chose the more difficult path of nonalignment .
From the very beginning , India 's foreign policy was based on its desire to attain an alternative global balance of power that , crucially , was structured around universal , nondiscriminatory disarmament .
Nuclear technology had already transformed global security .
Nuclear weapons , theorists reasoned , are not actually weapons of war but , in effect , military deterrents and tools of possible diplomatic coercion .
The basis of Indian nuclear policy , therefore , remains that a world free of nuclear weapons would enhance not only India 's security but the security of all nations .
In the absence of universal disarmament , India could scarcely accept a regime that arbitrarily divided nuclear haves from have-nots .
India has always insisted that all nations ' security interests are equal and legitimate .
From the start , therefore , its principles instilled a distaste for the self-identified and closed club of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council .
During the 1950s , nuclear weapons were routinely tested above ground , making the mushroom cloud the age 's symbol .
Even then , when the world had witnessed only a few dozen tests , India took the lead in calling for an end to all nuclear-weapons testing , but the calls of India 's first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , went unheeded .
In the 1960s , India 's security concerns deepened .
In 1962 , China attacked India on its Himalayan border .
The nuclear age entered India 's neighborhood when China became a nuclear power in October 1964 .
From then on , no responsible Indian leader could rule out the option of following suit .
With no international guarantees of Indian security forthcoming , nuclear abstinence by India alone seemed increasingly worrisome .
With the 1962 war with China very much on his mind , Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri began tentatively investigating a subterranean nuclear-explosion project .
A series of Indian nonproliferation initiatives had scant impact .
In 1965 , to make matters worse , the second war between India and Pakistan broke out .
Shastri died in 1966 and was succeeded by Indira Gandhi , who continued the fruitless search for international guarantees .
In 1968 , India reaffirmed its commitment to disarmament but decided not to sign the NPT .
In 1974 , it conducted its first nuclear test , Pokharan I. The first 50 years of Indian independence reveal that the country 's moralistic nuclear policy and restraint paid no measurable dividends , except resentment at home that India was being discriminated against .
Disarmament seemed increasingly unrealistic politics .
If the permanent five 's possession of nuclear weapons increases security , why would India 's possession of nuclear weapons be dangerous ?
If the permanent five continue to employ nuclear weapons as an international currency of force and power , why should India voluntarily devalue its own state power and national security ?
If deterrence works in the West -- as it so obviously appears to , since Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear weapons -- by what reasoning will it not work in India ?
Nuclear -weapons powers continue to have , but preach to the have-nots to have even less .
India counters by suggesting either universal , nondiscriminatory disarmament or equal security for the entire world .
On May 11 India successfully carried out three underground nuclear tests , followed on May 13 by two more underground , sub-kiloton tests .
These five tests , ranging from the sub-kiloton and fission variety to a thermonuclear device , amply demonstrated India 's scientific , technical and organizational abilities , which until then had only been vaguely suspected .
A fortnight later , on May 28 and 30 , neighboring Pakistan predictably carried out its own tests in the bleak fastness of the Chagai Hills in Baluchistan , near the Afghan border .
Suddenly the strategic equipoise of the post- Cold War world was rattled .
The entire nonproliferation regime and the future of disarmament were at the forefront of international agendas .
Since independence , India has consistently advocated global nuclear disarmament , convinced that a world without nuclear weapons will enhance both global and Indian security .
India was the first to call for a ban on nuclear testing in 1954 , for a nondiscriminatory treaty on nonproliferation in 1965 , for a treaty on nonuse of nuclear weapons in 1978 , for a nuclear freeze in 1982 , and for a phased program for complete elimination of nuclear weapons in 1988 .
Unfortunately , most of these initiatives were rejected by the nuclear-weapons states , who still consider these weapons essential for their own security .
What emerged , in consequence , has been a discriminatory and flawed nonproliferation regime that damages India 's security .
For years India conveyed its apprehensions to other countries , but this did not improve its security environment .
This disharmony and disjunction between global thought and trends in Indian thought about nuclear weapons is , unfortunately , the objective reality of the world .
Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power .
India could have lived with a nuclear option but without overt weaponization in a world where nuclear weapons had not been formally legitimized .
That course was no longer viable in the post-1995 world of legitimized nuclear weapons .
What 's more , the Sino - Pakistani nuclear weapons collaboration -- a flagrant violation of the NPT -- made it obvious that the NPT regime had collapsed in India 's neighborhood .
In negotiations on the CTBT in 1996 , India for the first time stated that the nuclear issue is a national-security concern for India and advanced that as one reason why India was unable to accede to the CTBT .
Presumably this persuaded the nuclear hegemons to introduce a clause at the last minute pressing India , along with 43 other nations , to sign the treaty to bring it into force .
This coercive clause violates the Vienna Convention on Treaties , which stipulates that a nation not willing to be a party to a treaty cannot have obligations arising out of that treaty imposed on it .
Even more galling , this clause was introduced at the insistence of China -- the provider of nuclear technology to Pakistan .
When the international community approved the coercive CTBT , India 's security environment deteriorated significantly .
India 's plight worsened as the decade wore on .
In 1997 more evidence surfaced on the proliferation between China and Pakistan and about U.S. permissiveness on this issue .
During Chinese President Jiang Zemin 's recent visit to Washington , the United States insisted on a separate agreement with China on Chinese proliferation to Iran and Pakistan , which the Chinese signed instead of professing their innocence .
Both the U.S. unease and the Chinese signature attest to Chinese proliferation as a threat to India 's security .
After all these assurances , China continued to pass missile technology and components to Pakistan .
Despite this , the Clinton administration was still willing to certify that China was not proliferating or -- even worse for India -- that the United States was either unable or unwilling to restrain China .
As the range of options for India narrowed , so too did the problems of taking corrective action .
The tests of May 11 and 13 were not directed against any country .
They were intended to reassure the people of India about their own security .
Confidence -building is a continuous process to which India remains committed .
India 's motive remains security , not , as some have speciously charged , domestic politics .
Had the tests been motivated simply by electoral exigencies , there would have been no need to test the range of technologies and yields demonstrated in May .
In the marketplace of Indian public life , a simple low-yield device would have sufficed .
Since that marketplace did not govern the decision to experiment , the tests encompassed the range of technologies necessary to make a credible nuclear deterrent .
India is now a nuclear weapons state , as is Pakistan .
That reality can neither be denied nor wished away .
India 's strengthened nuclear capacity adds to its sense of responsibility -- the obligation of power .
India , mindful of its international duties , is committed to not using these weapons to commit aggression or to mount threats against any country .
These are weapons of self-defense , to ensure that India too is not subjected to nuclear coercion .
India remains committed to the basic tenet of its foreign policy -- a conviction that global elimination of nuclear weapons will enhance its security as well as that of the rest of the world .
Indeed , after the tests , India stated that it will henceforth observe a voluntary moratorium and refrain from conducting underground nuclear test explosions .
The basic obligation of the CTBT is thus met : to undertake no more nuclear tests .
Since India already subscribes to the substance of the test-ban treaty , all that remains is its actual signature .
India has also expressed readiness to participate in negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a fissile material cut-off treaty .
Its basic objective is to prohibit future production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons .
India 's approach in these negotiations will be to ensure that this treaty is universal , nondiscriminatory and backed by an effective verification mechanism .
The end of the Cold War did not result in the end of history .
The great thaw that began in the late 1980s only melted down the ancient animosities of Europe .
We have not entered a unipolar order .
India still lives in a rough neighborhood .
It would be a great error to assume that simply advocating the new mantras of globalization and the market serves to make national security subservient to global trade .
The 21st century will not be the century of trade .
The world still has to address the unfinished agenda of the centuries .
