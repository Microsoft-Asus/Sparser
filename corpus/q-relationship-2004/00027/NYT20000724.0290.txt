Deaths from the human form of mad cow disease appear to be increasing , British health officials have reported , but they say it is still unclear whether the increase is the start of an epidemic or merely a statistical blip .
So far this year , 14 Britons have died of the disease .
That is as many as died all last year , and five others are known to be dying from the disease .
If the trend continues and it is , in fact , the beginning of an epidemic , experts estimate that over the next 30 years as many as 500,000 Britons could die from the disease , which is contracted from eating infected beef products and is always fatal .
Even if the numbers begin to fall or hold steady , they said , hundreds or thousands people are going to die from the disease , called variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease , which literally eats holes in the brains of its victims .
`` I am worried about this year 's figures , '' Dr. Roy Anderson , a zoologist from Oxford University who has studied the epidemic , told The Independent , a British newspaper , last week .
Anderson said Britain was just now seeing the consequences of exposure to the disease in cows in the early 1980s .
He said in humans the disease had a `` long incubation period , then cases appearing in a trickle . ''
The rise in deaths now fits that pattern , he said : `` That 's what you expect in an epidemic . ''
Other experts said the trend was less certain .
`` It 's hard to know what the new numbers mean , '' Dr. Peter Smith , an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said in a telephone interview .
Smith is acting director of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Council , which advises the British government on the disease .
Smith said that the number of cases remained flat for the last four years , and that something now appeared to have been `` switched on . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Since it first appeared in humans in 1996 , a total of 74 people in Britain , two in France and one in Ireland are dead or dying from the disease , he said .</ENAMEX>
The increase in deaths this year `` is surprising , and it is of some concern , '' Smith said .
`` But it does not necessarily portend a large epidemic . ''
The Health Department issues a monthly bulletin on the number of cases , Smith said .
The next one is due Aug. 7 .
Mad cow disease first appeared in the mid-1980s when British cattle began falling ill with a mysterious brain malady .
The epidemic was traced to protein feed supplements infected with brain and nervous tissue extracted from sick cows .
Since then , more than 176,000 cows have died from the disease and 4 million more were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further .
But it soon turned out that the infection could spread from cows to humans through eating contaminated beef products , a fact confirmed scientifically only last year .
The transfer to humans was first suspected in 1996 , when 10 young people died with spongy holes in their brains .
Until then , such symptoms were found only in much older people who died from a form of Creutzfeldt - Jakob 's disease not related to eating beef .
But since the disease may have an incubation period of more than 25 years , the question remains how many Britons may be infected and will eventually die from it .
Millions of people probably came into contact with infected meat , though it is not clear how many will actually contract the disease , Smith said .
So far all those infected have possessed a particular genetic trait that apparently predisposed them to the disease .
At least 40 percent of the British population share that trait , which involves a variation of the prion protein , according to experts .
Health officials announced last week that they had identified a probable cluster of cases in Queniborough , a small village about 100 miles north of London .
Four young adults from the area have apparently died of the disease in the last two years , and fifth person , who just turned 25 , is near death .
Epidemiologists are combing the village for clues to what the victims had in common and to help them better understand how the disease spreads from cows to people .
Researchers are handing out questionnaires to the village 's 2,297 residents asking them what they ate 10 years to 15 years ago .
They are also investigating 10 local slaughterhouses where cattle parts , including offal , were often turned into specialty meats .
It is possible that a locally slaughtered `` mad '' cow made its way into sausages eaten by Queniborough 's children , said Dr. Philip Monk , who is an expert in communicable diseases at the Leicestershire Health Authority .
