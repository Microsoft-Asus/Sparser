SEOUL , South Korea --
Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca - Cola crossed into the North , one of orthodox communism 's last redoubts .
The precedent-setting discussions in Pyongyang , the northern capital , between President Kim Dae -jung of South Korea and his communist counterpart , Kim Jong Il , generated a kind of euphoria , and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea , a reclusive nation of 22 million .
But now , major U.S. and European businesses are again expressing deep caution .
And Coca - Cola Co. , often seen as an icon of Western capitalism that helped lead the way into communist countries like China and Vietnam , is vague about what it envisions doing in North Korea .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` It is our intention to continue supplying our product to the North Korean market , '' said John Gustaveson , a spokesman for Coca - Cola in South Korea .</ENAMEX>
`` But at this point of time , we do n't know yet . ''
While it will continue to watch the situation in the North , Coke said , it currently has no plans to build a bottling plant there .
Coca - Cola would not comment on the identity of its customers in North Korea , the people who were presumably able to taste that first batch of Coke , and this raised suspicions as to whether the drinks had reached ordinary North Koreans .
But Coca - Cola acknowledged that it was paid for its products .
`` It was a business transaction and not just a good-will gesture , '' Gustaveson said .
Regardless of recent overtures by Seoul and Washington , officials in Pyongyang may still consider the eagerness of Western companies to do business there as a threat .
As a result , some South Korean experts said , North Korea might limit the pace of change , remaining highly selective and uncompromising about the investments it accepts .
`` They perceive any hint of economic integration as a Trojan horse , '' said Cho Sung - Ryoul , a researcher at the Institute for National Security Policy in Seoul .
Last year , after Washington partly lifted trade sanctions against the North , the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea sought to send a delegation of American business representatives to Pyongyang .
A year later , despite the lifting of more sanctions by Washington , the business group is still waiting for permission to visit .
`` We have plenty of companies that are interested , '' said Jeffrey Jones , the chamber 's president .
`` But it all depends on the government there . ''
Others said it would take more than tempting products or alluring business plans to get the Pyongyang authorities to grant access to foreign businesses .
Hungry for cash to rebuild its battered economy , North Korean officials are still impressed most by hard currency up front .
`` They tend to believe that when you want to start a business , you come with a bag full of cash , '' said Jean - Jacques Grauhar , head of the North Korea business committee at the European Union Chamber of Commerce in South Korea .
Another obstacle to investment in the North is that foreigners do not know whom to deal with .
Groups from the North seeking deals with foreign investors include companies that are fronts for the Communist Party , the commerce ministry and the North Korean army .
`` There 's no single controlling entity , '' Grauhar said .
`` It 's so confusing for foreign companies that the business becomes more limited . ''
As a representative of a French trading company , Grauhar lived in Pyongyang for seven years , where he also consulted with foreign companies wanting to enter the North Korean market .
He cautioned that even those companies that gain access to Northern business representatives will face surprises .
Some business practices common in North Korea are likely to bedevil foreign executives .
For instance , the North Koreans prefer to meet in hotels and not in their offices , making it difficult to gauge the size of the companies they say they represent .
The background and the role of these representatives may also be hard to ascertain .
`` It 's very important to cross-check everything , that you speak to the right person who has the decision-making powers that he says he has , '' Grauhar said .
`` It takes time , and you have to meet them again and again . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Yoon Sang - Ryul , a deputy manager at Hyundai Asan Co. , which oversees the North Korean business interests of Hyundai Group , South Korea 's largest conglomerate , said decision-making in the North is cumbersome and often difficult for outsiders to understand .</ENAMEX>
`` Everything progresses from bottom to top by reaching a consensus at each level , '' he said , `` and outsiders are not allowed into the consensus-forming group .
Initially , it is important to build relationships rather than focusing on profit-driven models . ''
Cho at the Institute for National Security Policy said foreign businesses considering investments in North Korea would do well to remember what South Korea was like in the late 1960s , when its relatively backward economy was being developed under the military dictatorship of Gen. Park hee .
`` The North Koreans seem to have studied Park Chung -hee 's economic plan very carefully , '' Cho said .
`` The core of his leadership was introducing a market -based economy while maintaining an authoritarian rule . ''
Park used his powers to ensure that concentrating investment in a handful of industries and companies most likely to encourage fast economic growth did not lead to social and political unrest .
And Cho said that foreigners looking to do business in the North should expect to operate within the parameters established by a totalitarian government .
Beyond those considerations , the North -- while it has a large , well-trained work force -- has none of the infrastructure that modern business relies on .
The South Korean central bank estimates that it will cost more than $ 50 billion over the next decade to create the modern manufacturing base , telecommunications and other infrastructure needed to make foreign investment a success .
