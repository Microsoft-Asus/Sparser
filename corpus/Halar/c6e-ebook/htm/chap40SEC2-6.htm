The internal environment of vertebrates is called the <span class="Emphasis2">interstitial fluid</span> (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 40.8</span>). This fluid, which fills the spaces between our cells, exchanges nutrients and wastes with blood contained in microscopic vessels called capillaries. Bernard also recognized that many animals tend to maintain relatively constant conditions in their internal environment, even when the external environment changes. A pond-dwelling hydra is powerless to affect the temperature of the fluid that bathes its cells, but the human body can maintain its "internal pond" at a more-or-less constant temperature of about 37&#176;C. Our bodies also can control the pH of our blood and interstitial fluid to within a tenth of a pH unit of 7.4, and regulate the amount of sugar in our blood so that it does not fluctuate for long from a concentration of 0.1% . There are times, of course, during the development of an animal when major changes in the internal environment are programmed to occur. For example, the balance of hormones in human blood is altered radically during puberty and pregnancy. Still, the stability of the internal environment is remarkable.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Today, Bernard’s "constant internal milieu" is incorporated into the concept of <span class="Emphasis2">homeostasis,</span> which means "steady state," or internal balance. One of the main objectives of modern physiology, and a theme of this unit, is to learn how animals maintain homeostasis. Actually, the internal environment of an animal always fluctuates slightly. Homeostasis is a dynamic state, an interplay between outside forces that tend to change the internal environment and internal control mechanisms that oppose such changes.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
