Long-distance transport of water from roots to leaves occurs by bulk flow, the movement of fluid driven by a pressure difference at opposite ends of a conduit. In a plant, the conduits are xylem vessels or chains of tracheids. The pressure difference is generated at the leaf end by transpirational pull, which lowers pressure (increases tension) at the "upstream" end of the xylem.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">On a smaller scale, gradients of water potential drive the osmotic movement of water from cell to cell within root and leaf tissue (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 36.11</span>). Differences in both solute concentration and pressure contribute to this microscopic transport. In contrast, bulk flow, the mechanism for long-distance transport up xylem vessels, depends only on pressure. Another contrast with osmosis, which moves only water, is that bulk flow moves the whole solution, water plus minerals and any other solutes dissolved in the water.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The plant expends none of its own metabolic energy to lift xylem sap up to the leaves by bulk flow. The absorption of sunlight drives transpiration by causing water to evaporate from the moist walls of mesophyll cells and by maintaining a high humidity in the air spaces within a leaf. Thus, the ascent of xylem sap is ultimately solar powered.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
