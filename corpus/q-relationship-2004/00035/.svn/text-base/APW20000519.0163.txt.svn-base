CARACAS , Venezuela
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Venezuela 's bitter election campaign is reportedly costing President Hugo Chavez support inside the armed forces , with many officers and soldiers flocking to his main challenger .
The apparent shift casts doubt on Chavez 's vision of a `` civic-military '' revolution that would put the armed forces to work for the poor .
It 's also stirring speculation of a possible coup .
Chavez took office in February 1999 and moved quickly to secure support within Venezuela 's 120,000-member armed forces , appointing army officers to top government posts and dispatching tens of thousands of soldiers to fix roads and hospitals .
But now the candidacy of Francisco Arias Cardenas , a former army officer who helped Chavez stage a 1992 coup attempt , is attracting support from officers and servicemen who oppose the president 's perceived attempts to politicize the armed forces .
The election -- required by a constitution pushed through by Chavez last year -- is set for May 28 .
For the first time in the South American country 's 42-year -old democracy , soldiers will cast ballots for president , congress , governors , mayors and local councils .
Military personnel say this change , stipulated in the new constitution , is causing concern among officers who want to keep the armed forces out of politics .
`` The military vote is taking place at the worst possible time , '' said retired Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich , who was defense minister during the 1992 coup attempt .
`` The country is so divided , and this division has entered into the armed forces . ''
Ochoa told The Associated Press he has learned of elements inside the army that are conspiring to overthrow the government .
And a group claiming to consist of military captains has distributed a statement to Venezuelan journalists threatening a coup unless Chavez makes `` radical changes '' in his agenda .
On Friday , a group of retired generals called the Institutional Military Front issued a communique denouncing `` grave irregularities '' in this month 's elections .
`` It 's probable that certain presidential candidates and vast sectors of society will not accept the results of the election , '' the statement said .
`` In that difficult moment , the armed forces should tip the balance to maintain public order and preserve the rule of law . ''
Despite the rumblings , many analysts believe a coup is unlikely unless Chavez loses support among the masses .
The president leads Arias in polls by as much as 20 points even though Venezuela is mired in a deep economic recession .
After he took office , Chavez faced opposition from critics who insisted a democracy could not coexist with the militarization of civilian institutions .
Nevertheless , his efforts to win the military over were largely successful at first .
Army officers , many of whom hailed from working-class families , appreciated the president 's agenda championing the rights of the poor .
They supported his tirades against the corrupt way officers often were promoted in previous governments .
Many generals and colonels also were pleased to be given the chance to administer hundreds of millions of dollars in funds earmarked for development projects .
Congressional candidate Tarek William Saab , a key Chavez ally , believes the president still enjoys the support of the armed forces .
`` The virtue of our revolution is that it is a civic-military project in which the unity of the people is well reflected in the national armed forces , '' he said .
In truth , it 's difficult to gauge the extent of Chavez 's military support since no reliable surveys exist .
But the split between Chavez and the three former commanders who helped him stage his 1992 putsch -- including candidate Arias -- has uncovered deep military dissatisfaction with Chavez 's leftist agenda and given officers an alternative outlet for their loyalty .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Chavez 's recent cancellation of two joint military training exercises with the United States and his promotion of military ties to Cuba `` has reinforced irritation with Chavez '' in the armed forces , said retired Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu .</ENAMEX>
Carratu and other retired officers confirmed that a group of current officers recently sat down with Chavez , a former lieutenant colonel , and asked him to stop wearing his military uniform at political rallies -- an admonition the president has honored .
Chavez 's program using 70,000 soldiers in public works projects is also reportedly causing discontent among soldiers who believe they should focus on defense .
Arias has promised to `` return soldiers to their barracks '' if elected .
