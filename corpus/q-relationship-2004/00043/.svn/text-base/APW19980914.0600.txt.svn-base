WARSAW , Poland
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
A Warsaw court on Monday handed stiff prison terms of up to 15 years to a criminal gang for numerous counts of car theft and robbery in Poland 's largest organized crime trial .
The gang leader , identified by the court only as Marek Cz. , was sentenced to 10 years in prison for directing a criminal organization .
Two of his main aides , Krzysztof B. And Jacek S. were given 13 and 15 year sentences , while 12 others were sentenced from 1 1/2 to 10 years .
The court found two others innocent .
The defendants , in their 20s and 30s , were convicted as members of an organized criminal group and several counts of robbery , car theft , extortion , arson and illegal possession of arms from 1995-96 .
They are believed to be members of the so-called Wolomin gang , one of two large criminal groups apparently fighting for control in Warsaw .
The case , in which prosecutors for the first time depended largely on anonymous witnesses , was seen as a part of a government crackdown against organized crime .
Two other gangs are currently on trial for armed robberies and holdups .
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 , Poland has seen an increase in organized crime dealing with car thefts , extortion , alcohol smuggling , currency exchange and drug trafficking .
Last week , five bodies were found fatally shot in southwestern Poland , in a case police say was a part of a war between gangs over control of the borders with Germany and the Czech Republic .
