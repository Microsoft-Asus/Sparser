Her husband , 38-year -old Joseph Santos , was sentenced to four years .
Authorities said the couple attempted to infiltrate the U.S. Southern Command , which controls U.S. military activity in Latin America .

They faced a maximum of five years in prison .
In all , 14 people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S. military bases , infiltrate anti- Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations .

Three others besides the couple have pleaded guilty ; others are scheduled to go on trial in May .
