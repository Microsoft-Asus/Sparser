WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he received support Thursday from President Clinton for efforts to achieve peace in areas threatened by Muslim insurgents and for helping long-neglected Filipino war veterans .
Estrada , speaking to reporters at the White House , said the two leaders discussed Asian security concerns , economic development , and trade and investment .
Clinton did not make a statement .
`` I informed President Clinton of the Philippines ' continuing support of America 's regional security presence in the Asia - Pacific , '' Estrada said , noting an agreement he helped push through the Philippine Congress that allows a resumption of joint U.S. - Philippine military training .
That was a switch from Estrada 's position in 1991 , when as a senator he helped expel the last U.S. base from the former American colony .
Estrada said direct military assistance was not discussed .
He assured Clinton of his commitment to achieve peace in a region where foreign hostages have been held since April , and said that Clinton offered support for the peace process .
He thanked Clinton for helping with legislation that gives greater access for Filipino World War II veterans to U.S. benefits , even if they now live in the Philippines .
Pending are other measures that would further compensate Filipino veterans who fought under the American flag during World War II .
In a statement released after the Estrada meeting , Clinton said he directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to study the health needs of aging Filipino WWII veterans in the United States .
`` I am eager to find a way to fulfill the needs of this deserving group of veterans , '' Clinton said .
In advance of their meeting , Estrada told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , `` Our alliance has seen both bad and good times . ''
But , he added , `` No other ally in the region has stood by you through all the wars in the last six decades . ''
Groups representing 3 million Philippine - Americans welcomed Estrada but also expressed concern over veterans ' compensation and toxic waste , said Jon Melegrito , president of the National Federation of Filipino American Associations .
`` The veterans ' plight has been a long-neglected matter of justice , and it also has a lot to do with America 's honor , '' he said .
Filipino - Americans also are concerned about debris left behind by U.S. forces because they have relatives living in the areas around former Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Base , Melegrito said .
As Estrada met with Clinton , hope increased for release of a $ 325 million loan disbursement from the International Monetary Fund .
The fund 's board of directors scheduled a meeting Monday to consider the installment under a $ 1.37 billion Philippine loan agreement .
The board had been scheduled to meet before Estrada 's visit , but delayed the session because of renewed concern over the his government 's budget deficit and decline of the currency .
Thomas Dawson , bank spokesman , said the delay was `` so we can take a look at what these developments are . ''
Financial officials traveling with Estrada met with IMF officials during the visit .
Estrada is accompanied by several members of his Cabinet and about 100 Philippine business leaders .
He also was meeting with other business groups and with Filipino - Americans in Washington and New York .
