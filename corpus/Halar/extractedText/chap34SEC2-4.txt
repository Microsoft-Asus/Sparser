 An overview of vertebrate diversity

FIGURE 34.7 (p. 684) is a hypothetical cladogram of extant (living) vertebrates based on a combination of anatomical, molecular, and fossil evidence. Two groups, the hagfishes and the lampreys, lack hinged jaws. All the other vertebrates are grouped in FIGURE 34.7 within the clade identified as the gnathostomes (which means "jawed mouth"). In addition to jaws, gnathostomes also have two sets of paired appendages. Among these jawed vertebrates, there are various classes of aquatic animals that we generally call "fishes": the cartilaginous fishes (sharks and rays) and three classes of bony fishes (the ray-fins, lobe-fins, and lungfishes). In the case of fishes, the two sets of paired appendages are fins that function in swimming. All the other gnathostomes are tetrapods ("four footed"), in which the two sets of paired appendages are modified as legs that can support the animals on land. The tetrapods include the amphibians (frogs and salamanders) along with the clade identified as amniotes in FIGURE 34.7. The amniotes are named for the amniotic egg, which is a shelled, water-retaining egg (think of grocery store eggs, which are laid by birds). The amniotic egg functions as a "self-contained pond" that enables amniotes to complete their life cycles on land. Although most modern mammals don't lay eggs, they retain many other key features of the amniotic mode of reproduction. Note that the amniotes we customarily lump together as "reptiles" (turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and alligators) do not represent a clade (monophyletic group)--unless we also include the birds.

Fig 34-7. Phylogeny of the major groups of extant vertebrates. Some of the branches in this cladogram are marked with one or more shared derived characters of the vertebrate groups beyond that point in the tree.

With the cladogram in FIGURE 34.7 as our guide, let's now take a closer look at the major vertebrate groups.
