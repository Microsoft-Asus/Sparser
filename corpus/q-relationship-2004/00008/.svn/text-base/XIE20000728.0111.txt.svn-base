TOKYO , July 28 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Tokyo District Court on Friday handed down a death sentence to former senior AUM Shinrikyo cult member Kiyohide Hayakawa for his role in two separate murder cases and for building a plant to mass-produce nerve gas .</ENAMEX>
In announcing the ruling , Presiding Judge Kaoru Kanayama said Hayakawa played a leading role on his own initiative in the November 1989 killings of a lawyer and his two family members in Yokohama .
Hayakawa is the seventh person to be sentenced to death for a series of crimes involving AUM .
The judge refuted Hayakawa 's defense that he was only following the orders of AUM founder Shoko Asahara , saying that he conspired with Asahara to kill the family .
`` It is unforgivable that he showed no hesitation to kill in the interest of the religious group .
There is no room at all for mercy .
We cannot see even a fragment of humanity in him , '' the judge said .
The lawyer had been aiding families of cult members who were seeking their defection from the cult .
Hayakawa was also convicted for the February 1989 strangling of a 21-year -old cult member who wanted to leave AUM .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hayakawa assembled a sarin plant at an AUM facility in Yamanashi Prefecture , west of Tokyo , after procuring equipment and raw materials for it between 1993 and 1994 , the court ruled </ENAMEX>.
Sarin gas was used in the 1994 attack in Matsumoto , Nagano Prefecture , and the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway system .
The two crimes claimed 19 lives and injured thousands .
Public prosecutors sought the death sentence last December for Hayakawa , known among AUM followers as the cult 's `` construction minister . ''
Hayakawa has admitted to all seven charges against him .
