CANBERRA , June 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Australian Prime Minister John Howard is scheduled to make a 13-day trip to Japan and the United States to settle economic disputes with the two countries and promote trade and investment .
The trip to the two countries , Australia 's most important political and economic partners , comes amid simmering trade tension over Japan 's decision to ignore international limits on southern bluefin tuna fishing in South Pacific , and the U.S. push to block Australian lamb imports .
In a statement issued Tuesday , Howard said the trip was designed to promote Australia 's strong economic credentials and the need to combat trade protection ahead of the APEC leaders summit in New Zealand in September .
During his five days in Japan from July 5 to 9 , Howard will meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi , followed by a meeting with Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko .
`` My aim will be to reinforce Australia 's strong economic and political partnership with Japan , '' Howard said .
`` I will also discuss how Australia and Japan can best cooperate in our region .
We have both played an important role in helping countries in the region emerge from the recent economic and financial downturn , '' he added .
`` The need to combat protectionist pressures through a strong outcome at the forthcoming APEC leaders meeting and further market opening through a new global trade round will be an important item on my agenda , '' he said .
In the U.S. , Howard will hold talks with President Bill Clinton and Congressional leaders to reinforce Australia 's commitment to lowering trade barriers .
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is currently in the U.S. to lobby against a push to impose new tariffs against Australian and New Zealand lamb .
Clinton is due to announce a decision on the lamb tariffs soon .
Howard will also use the trip to address financial leaders in New York and to promote Australia as a new global financial center .
`` My aim is to promote Australia 's competitive strengths as a base for global financial services , '' the prime minister said .
