IMMUNITY IN HEALTH AND DISEASE

 

 Immunity can be achieved naturally or artificially



 

 The immune system's capacity to distinguish self from nonself limits blood transfusion and tissue transplantation



 

 Abnormal immune function can lead to disease



 

 AIDS is an immunodeficiency disease caused by a virus



As we continue to learn more about the vertebrate immune system, we expand our understanding of the body's battles against infections and cancer, its establishment of long-term immunity, and its reaction to blood transfusions and tissue transplants. We also gain insight into the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of numerous diseases, including disorders of the immune system itself.
