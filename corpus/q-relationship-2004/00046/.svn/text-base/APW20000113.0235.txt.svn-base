SHALI , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russian troops , battered by surprise rebel counterattacks in Chechnya , were placed on alert Thursday and dug deep trenches in vulnerable villages to fend off new attacks .
After making steady progress against Chechen rebels since ground troops entered the republic in September , the Russian offensive stalled this week : Rebels attacked towns that Russian forces claimed to control and put up fierce resistance in Grozny , the capital , where fighters are entrenched in the center .
The Interfax news agency , citing sources in the federal command for Chechnya , said 33 Russian soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours in Chechnya .
Until recent days , Russian forces had claimed losses of no more than one or two soldiers a day .
Russia claimed to have retaken control of the towns of Argun and Shali this week .
But fighting continued on the outskirts of Gudermes , Chechnya 's second-largest city , said Lt. Col. Anatoly Yurasov , the deputy head of an Interior Ministry mobile unit .
Russian forces continued heavily shelling Grozny and troops were fighting rebels from trenches in some of the city 's neighborhoods , Interfax reported , citing military sources .
The report described the situation in Grozny as essentially unchanged from recent days .
In Shali and Argun , Russian troops dug deep trenches in preparation for possibly having to fend off rebels again , the NTV television channel reported .
Other units surrounded rebel formations in four other towns in the Shali region , Interfax said .
Following the rebels ' weekend counterattacks , all military checkpoints and stations in Russian -controlled areas of Chechnya have been placed on alert and provided with additional ammunition and armored vehicles , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
In another move to weaken the rebels , Russia this week declared that all males in Chechnya between ages 10 and 60 would be investigated for possible involvement with the rebels , and be barred from entering or leaving Chechnya .
`` The Russians are barbarians , '' said Lyoma Gibishev , a Grozny resident who was refused entry to Chechnya at a crossing point in Ingushetia .
`` They 're demonstrating their helplessness , vulnerability and also their inhumanity . ''
New York -based Human Rights Watch protested the Russian measure and the U.S. State Department asked Russia for clarification of the new regulation .
`` It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of civilians in and around Chechnya , not endanger the lives of noncombatants and ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons , '' State Department spokesman James Rubin said .
In Moscow , the head of Russia 's Federal Migration Service , Vladimir Kalamanov , said the new restriction was justified .

Russian soldiers complain that many Chechens disguise their rebel ties with sympathetic behavior .
`` They come up to us in daytime and offer cigarettes and biscuits .
And at night they shoot at us , '' said Capt. Aleksei Samoshkin at an Interior Ministry unit based in neighboring Dagestan .
Russian airplanes and helicopters flew more than 70 combat missions over Chechnya in the past 24 hours , the military said Thursday .
Targets included Argun and Shali , as well as the center of Grozny .
Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in late September after weeks of airstrikes .
The offensive aims at wiping out Chechnya -based rebels who twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan last summer and who are blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed about 300 people .
