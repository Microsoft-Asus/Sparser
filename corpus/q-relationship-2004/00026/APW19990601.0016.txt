-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Mir 's current crew will abandon the Russian space station in August , and the orbiter will circle Earth unmanned until early next year , when it is expected to burn up in the atmosphere , space officials said today .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Russia 's cash-strapped government has agreed to finance the 13-year -old space station only through August , and says it should be discarded then unless private funding is found</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Repeated attempts to raise money have failed</ENAMEX> .
A panel of top Russian space officials decided today that the best option would be for the three-man crew to leave in August , said Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko , a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency .
Prior to their departure , they will install and test new equipment allowing ground controllers to command the station without a crew on board , he said .
The officials moved to quell fears that the 130-ton station could spin out of control and cause havoc on the ground with a fiery return .
They said ground controllers would ensure that all fragments splash harmlessly into a remote part of the ocean .
`` Prior to the crew 's departure , they will install and test new equipment allowing ground controllers to ensure a trouble-free flight , '' Mikhailichenko said .
The record of Mir 's predecessor , the Salyut -7 , provoked doubts about the safety of an unmanned operation .
Soviet ground controllers lost control of the unmanned , 40-ton space station in February 1991 , and people the world over anxiously awaited its landing .
Pieces fell on a sparsely populated area in Argentina 's Andes mountains near the Chilean border , causing no injuries or damage .
But Mikhailichenko insisted there was no danger from the Mir .
If there is no money to extend the Mir 's flight , its orbit will gradually descend from its present 240 miles above Earth to 125 miles early next year , and ground controllers will send it to burn up in the atmosphere in February or March , Mikhailichenko said .
The U.S. space agency NASA has long urged Russia to abandon the Mir and concentrate its meager resources on the new international space station , which has been falling behind because of Russia 's failure to build its segments on time .
The first permanent crew is n't expected to move in until next March , almost two years behind schedule .
But Russian space officials have been reluctant to part with the Mir , the last symbol of the nation 's past space glory .
They fear that without the Mir , Russia will be left playing a secondary role in the new station , dominated by the United States .
`` Our station is like a thorn in the Americans ' side , '' Sergei Gorbunov , a spokesman for Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev , said on NTV television .
The Mir was plagued by several serious accidents in 1997 , including a fire , a near-fatal collision with a cargo ship and repeated failures of on-board computers and other equipment .
It has been running relatively smoothly since then , but Russia can no longer afford the $ 250 million a year needed for the Mir operation .
`` We ca n't keep the station aloft , because we have no money , '' Gorbunov said .
At the Johnson Space Center in Houston , NASA spokesman Rob Navias said the U.S. agency was not involved in the Russian decision .
`` We knew that they were going to make a decision , '' he said .
`` It 's their decision . ''
Russian space officials will now send their plan to President Boris Yeltsin 's government for final approval .
