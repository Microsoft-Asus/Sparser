The figure highlights key stages in the expression of a protein-coding gene, from chromatin changes that unpack the DNA, through transcription, RNA processing, and translation, to various alterations of the protein product. The expression of a given gene will not necessarily involve every stage shown; for example, not every polypeptide is cleaved. The main lesson is that each stage is a potential control point where gene expression can be turned on or off, speeded up, or slowed down. The figure omits details and does not convey the web of control that connects <span class="Emphasis1">different</span> genes and their products. In the following three sections, we’ll examine some of the important control points more closely.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig19-7','../fig/big/fig19-7.jpg','fig19-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig19-7.jpg" alt="fig19-7" name="myfig19-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 19-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Opportunities for the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.</span> The nuclear envelope separating transcription from translation in eukaryotic cells offers opportunity for post-transcriptional control in the form of RNA processing that is absent in bacteria. In addition, eukaryotes have a greater variety of control mechanisms operating before transcription and after translation. In this diagram, the processes that offer opportunities for regulation are highlighted by white or yellow boxes. As in prokaryotes, transcription initiation is the most important control point.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
