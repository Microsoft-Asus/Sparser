Two of these groups are the diplomonads and the parabasalids. According to what is called the "archaezoa hypothesis," these protists are the modern forms of ancient eukaryotic lineages that evolved before the acquisition of the endosymbiotic bacteria that gave rise to mitochondria. Most protistan systematists have recently rejected that hypothesis based on the discovery of mitochondrial genes in the nuclear genomes of the diplomonads and parabasalids. In other words, the evidence now supports the hypothesis that these protists <span class="Emphasis1">lost</span> their mitochondria during their evolution from ancestors in which mitochondria were present. However, other details of cell structure combined with data from molecular systematics still place the diplomonads and parabasalids on the phylogenetic branch that diverged earliest in eukaryotic history (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.8</span>).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">diplomonads</span> have multiple flagella, two separate nuclei, a relatively simple cytoskeleton (compared with other eukaryotes), no plastids, and, as already pointed out, no mitochondria. An infamous example is <span class="Emphasis1">Giardia lamblia</span>, a parasite that infects the human intestine, causing abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.9</span>). People most often pick up <span class="Emphasis1">Giardia</span> by drinking water contaminated with human feces containing the parasite in a dormant cyst stage. Drinking such water from what seems like a pristine stream or river can ruin a camping trip. Boiling drinking water kills the cysts.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-9','../fig/big/fig28-9.jpg','fig28-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-9.jpg" alt="fig28-9" name="myfig28-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Giardia lamblia</span>, a diplomnad</span> (colorized SEM).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">parabasalids,</span> another group lacking mitochondria, include the protists called trichomonads.
