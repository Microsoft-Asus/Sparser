BODY PLANS AND THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

 

 Physical laws constrain animal form



 

 Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment



An animal's size and shape, features that biologists often call body plans or designs, are fundamental aspects of form and function that significantly affect the way an animal interacts with its environment. By using the terms plan and design here, we do not mean to imply that animal body forms are products of a conscious invention. The body plan or design of an animal results from a pattern of development programmed by the genome, itself the product of millions of years of evolution due to natural selection.
