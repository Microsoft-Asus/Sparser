ANKARA , January 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkish intellectuals of Kurdish origin have started initiatives to form new political parties in the country , Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday .
The move came after they were relieved of the oppression from the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- , which has been seeking an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey through violent means , the report said .
The PKK military actions in the country have weakened since the capture of its leader Abdullah Ocalan and many of its radical members have left Turkish territory .
Some former Kurdish members of leftist Turkish parties have planned a new leftist party while some others have initiated a right-wing party .
Serafettin Elci , a lawyer of Kurdish origin and former Turkish minister of public works and housing , is planning to form a liberal and more independent party .
He said `` we would not call ourselves a Kurdish party , '' adding , however , that `` if we were referred to as one -LRB- Kurdish party -RRB- , it would not bother us .
If the current laws in Turkey permitted us to form a Kurdish party , we would have founded one . ''
He stressed that the political party his people are organizing will `` have respect for the territorial integrity of the Turkish Republic and refrain from all forms of violation . ''
The party , he said , will `` place a special emphasis on three basic rights , which are language , culture and education . ''
He elaborated that `` we request that every ethnic group has the right to set up its own educational progress and want regional administrations to replace the centralized structure .
We are not against the official language but a second language should be authorized in regional administrations . ''
`` Although we support liberal national economy , we believe state intervention could eliminate inequality between regions , '' he added .
