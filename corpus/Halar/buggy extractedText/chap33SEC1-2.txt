RADIATA

 

 Phylum Cnidaria: Cnidarians have radial symmetry, a gastrovascular cavity, and cnidocytes



 

 Phylum Ctenophora: Comb jellies possess rows of ciliary plates and adhesive colloblasts



All animals except sponges belong to a clade called Eumetazoa, the animals with true tissues (see Chapter 32). Among the eumetazoans, the oldest clade is Radiata, consisting of animals with radial symmetry and diploblastic embryos (with ectoderm and endoderm, but no mesoderm). The two phyla of Radiata, Cnidaria and Ctenophora, may have had separate origins from different parazoan ancestors.
