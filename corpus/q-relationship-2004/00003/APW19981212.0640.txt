STOCKHOLM , Sweden

With the Irish Republican Army resistant to laying down its weapons , Northern Ireland 's Nobel Peace Prize winners John Hume and David Trimble differed Saturday over the importance of disarmament to the troubled peace process .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Hume and Trimble , who received the prize on Thursday for their efforts in working out a peace accord</ENAMEX> , spoke at a seminar one day after the IRA inidcated it was not prepared to start disarming , as called for in the agreement .
Trimble said the development was worrisome and said disarmanent by both republican and unionist paramilitaries was critical to show that their commitment to the peace process was `` anything more than tactical , anything more than skin-deep . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble is leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , the largest party supporting the majority Protestant position that Northern Ireland should remain a part of the United Kingdom .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , head of the largely Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party</ENAMEX> , said placing emphasis on disarmanent was `` a distraction . ''
`` The real issue about weapons is if they have stopped being used , '' he said , adding that even if the IRA and other paramilitaries turned in weapons , that would not necessarily end suspicions .
`` I have no doubt that certain parties with loud voces would ` How do we know they 've given us all their weapons ' ? '' he said .
The IRA previously has dismissed calls to begin destroying its stockpiled arms .
Trimble , in his prize-acceptance speech , emphasized that Protestants would not permit the IRA -allied Sinn Fein party to enter any new administration for Northern Ireland without concrete evidence that the IRA had really renounced violence .
In Stockholm , Trimble said he would be flexible about circumstances for the IRA turning in weapons and would not demand they be turned in to the Royal Ulster Constabulary , which the IRA would certainly regards as humiliating .
His only condition for disarmament , he said , was `` whatever is done , there 's got to be a television camera there . ''
Despite the latest snag in the process , both Hume and Trimble expressed confidence in the accord 's ultimate success .
Because the accord was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum , `` opposing the agreement is opposing the will of the people and that weakens -LRB- the paramilitaries -RRB- substantially , '' he said .
The paramilitaries eventually `` will find themselves obliged to fulfill this part of the agreement , '' Trimble agreed .
