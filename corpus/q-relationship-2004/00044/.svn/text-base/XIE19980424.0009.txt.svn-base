JOHANNESBURG , April 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South African police have arrested 117 Nigerians for drug trafficking in a suburb of the commercial center of Johannesburg , Southern African Broadcasting Association reported Thursday .
From January 1997 to March this year , the majority of drug dealers in Hillbrow , a crime-laden suburb of Johannesburg , have been Nigerians , according to Sharma Maharaj , a police commissioner for Gauteng Province , where Johannesburg is located .
Police have a difficult task to combat drug dealers because of a shortage of anti-drug personnel , Maharaj said .
There are only 22 narcotics bureau members in Johannesburg , while the residents in Hillbrow alone exceed one million .
Owners of apartment blocks and hotels in the area are cooperating with drug pushers and they alert the dealers about police raids , Maharaj said .
