									<a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">In this chapter, you learned that photorespiration can substantially decrease a plant’s photosynthetic output. In soybeans, for example, it can eliminate up to 50%  of the fixed carbon. Would you expect this figure to be higher or lower in wild relatives of soybeans? Why?</p>

									<a name="para99"></a><p class="BlockText">The diagram below represents an experiment with isolated chloroplasts. The chloroplasts were first made acidic by soaking them in a solution at pH 4. After the thylakoid space reached pH 4, the chloroplasts were transferred to a basic solution at pH 8. The chloroplasts then made ATP in the dark. Explain this result.</p>

									<a name="para101"></a><p class="BlockText">CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the atmosphere traps heat and warms the air, just as clear glass does in a greenhouse. Most scientists believe that the CO<SUB>2</SUB> added to the air by the burning of wood and fossil fuels by humans is contributing to a dangerous rise in global temperature. Tropical rain forests are estimated to be responsible for more than 20%  of global photosynthesis. It seems reasonable to expect that the lush growth of jungle foliage would reduce global warming by consuming large amounts of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, but many experts now believe that rain forests make little or no <span class="Emphasis1">net</span> contribution to reduction of global warming. Why might this be? (<span class="Emphasis1">Hint:</span> What happens to the food produced by a rain forest tree when it is eaten by animals or the tree dies?)</p>
