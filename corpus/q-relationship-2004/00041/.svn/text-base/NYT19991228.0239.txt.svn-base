CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico --
The spectacle this month of the Mexican and U.S. authorities ' digging up bodies on remote ranches near this border city has a lot to do with what happened two years ago in one of this city 's better-known saloons .
Three yuppies of the drug trade , young smugglers from El Paso , were celebrating one more successful deal on Jan. 10 , 1998 .
After dinner in Juarez , they entered the Kentucky Bar for a night of drinking .
Even before the drinks arrived , armed men dressed in black burst in shouting `` judicial police ! '' and began beating them with assault rifles .
The Americans were forced into a waiting Chevrolet Suburban and carried away .
Their relatives never saw them again .
The brazen abduction followed a pattern almost routine here since 1993 , in which more than 100 people vanished after being grabbed by armed men who identified themselves as policemen .
One of the worst kept secrets of this rough-and-tumble city is that the federal police appear to have collaborated with drug traffickers by taking part in abductions , beatings and killings .
Even the special prosecutor appointed by the attorney general says that in 45 disappearance investigations , he has found evidence of federal police involvement in every case .
Witnesses have reported seeing policemen take part in abductions .
Others report seeing victims in the custody of the police .
But no investigation had led anywhere until that night at the Kentucky Bar .
Because American citizens were involved , a young FBI agent in El Paso began looking into it , eventually piecing together much of the puzzle and learning of a site in Mexico where some of the victims may have been buried .
Earlier this month , the United States and Mexico began the operation to dig up bones at four ranches near Juarez .
So far , remains of nine bodies have been unearthed , a modest but not insignificant achievement in what is one of the largest law enforcement operations between the two countries .
But there is little indication so far that the investigation has done much to curb the purported collusion between the Mexican police and drug traffickers .
`` There 's never been any serious Mexican investigation , '' said Victor Clark Alfaro , a human rights leader who has studied the cases of dozens of people who have disappeared in northern Mexico .
`` These abductions are carried out by an alliance between organized crime and government officials , and since the victims are people with ties to traffickers , authorities do n't take them seriously . ''
Because the exhumations continue , officials of both the United States and Mexico have shrouded the investigation in secrecy .
But some details , including those surrounding the Kentucky Bar , have emerged from interviews with people who have been questioned by the FBI .
Some of their information has been confirmed by U.S. court records and other interviews .
One of the major sources for this article , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity , was described by Enrique Cocina Perez , Mexico 's special prosecutor for the Juarez disappearances , as a key figure in the inquiry .
The FBI , after examining materials from this report for several days , declined to comment on specific points .
`` There were hundreds of persons involved in this , so you ca n't present this as the overall story , '' said David Alba , the FBI special agent in charge in El Paso , suggesting that there were elements of the investigation that had not been revealed .
The three Americans celebrating in the bar that night were Eduardo Barragan , Jorge Luis Garibay and Guadalupe Matthew Baca .
They were residents of El Paso in their 30s , and Barragan was well known locally as the gregarious and attractive scion of a wealthy family .
When he attended Burges High School El Paso in the 1980s , Barragan drove a DeLorean sports car .
His sister Cecilia , who is Baca 's wife , said in an interview that the family wealth derived from legitimate businesses , including the limousine service her brother owned .
When Barragan disappeared , however , his father , Henry Barragan , was serving time in a federal prison on charges of cocaine trafficking .
All three men in the bar that night were participants in a smuggling group with a $ 3 million-a-month contract to the Juarez drug cartel , according to a person familiar with their activities .
Their business was to take possession of tons of marijuana in Juarez and carry the loads across the bridges to warehouses in El Paso , the person said .
Their abduction was witnessed by dozens of passers-by , making it similar to many other disappearance cases .
In some of those instances , men with police credentials have blocked off Juarez streets to pull victims out of cars .
In others , uniformed policemen have carried people away after smashing into their homes .
In a few cases , the victims have been seen later in Federal Police custody .
On several occasions , Juarez city police officers have witnessed the abductions and filed reports , but the reports later disappeared from official files .
Since 1997 , relatives of people who disappeared from Juarez and El Paso have clamored for justice through an association .
Its leaders have compiled a list of 196 people who have disappeared since 1993 .
The Juarez newspaper , Norte , has counted 120 people who vanished .
The missing include 22 Americans .
After the three Americans were dragged from the Kentucky Bar , Barragan 's family made contact with the FBI .
According to a person familiar with the inquiry , intelligence information led FBI agents to focus early attention on Jose Ismael Cruz , a 29-year -old Mexican who had been a minor employee in the Americans ' smuggling group , driving marijuana across the bridges .
Within days after the abductions , Cruz took over the smuggling contract previously held by the missing Americans .
Two months after the three disappeared , FBI agents arrested two of Cruz 's employees as they crossed into El Paso with 1.5 tons of marijuana .
Once in custody , the men agreed to provide evidence against Cruz , Ray Velarde , Cruz 's lawyer , said in an interview .
Over the next year , they and other confidential informants provided the FBI with detailed information on Cruz 's operations .
Last April , 13 months after the first arrests , agents raided an El Paso drug warehouse disguised as a plastics recycling plant , seizing 4.5 tons of marijuana and arresting three more of Cruz 's employees .
Cruz was arrested in June , after a wild car chase that began when FBI agents intercepted him as he drove away from an El Paso bar , and ended when several agents crashed their cars into his BMW .
Cruz is in an El Paso jail awaiting trial on charges of resisting arrest and conspiracy to distribute marijuana .
In the debriefing sessions of Cruz 's associates , FBI agents heard theories about why the Americans were abducted , according to a person familiar with the inquiry .
One was that Cruz was so determined to rise in the trafficking world that he had organized a virtual coup against his smuggling employers , hiring Mexican policemen well known in Juarez as contract assassins to execute the Americans .
Others said the Americans were drug soldiers killed in a larger battle raging at the time between rival cartel leaders .
One of the people cooperating with the FBI provided a horrifying witness account of the Americans ' last hours .
They were taken to a Juarez mansion , where the police assassins and Cruz beat them savagely , ignoring pleas for mercy , and kicking them endlessly after they had slumped to the floor .
By the time the witness left the scene , it was unclear if they were dead or alive , and Cruz 's cowboy boots were drenched in blood .
After the newspaper Norte identified Cruz as the organizer of the Americans ' disappearance , Cruz denied the accusations in a jail-house conversation with his lawyer , Velarde said .
During the FBI 's questioning of Cruz 's associates , one of the informants said he thought he knew where the missing Americans might be buried ; he identified several ranches in and around Juarez , where the police were known to bury their victims , according to two people who have been interviewed repeatedly by the FBI .
The FBI agents were not the only investigators hearing reports about the grave sites .
So was Cocina , the Mexican special prosecutor looking into the disappearances .
He was the fourth in a series of prosecutors to take on the cases , and all of his predecessors had had a dismal record .
The first fell asleep during depositions , and two others were accused of crimes and dismissed .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- In contrast , Cocina quickly waded into the details of dozens of cases , said Jaime Hervella , the El Paso accountant who founded the relatives ' association .
Cocina told association leaders that he had taken federal jurisdiction over 45 investigations and had found evidence of involvement by federal police officers in every case .
Cocina collected photographs and thick files on many of the suspect officers , Hervella said .
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- Cocina declined to be interviewed .
But people familiar with his inquiry said he was told in detail about the clandestine graveyards as early as last spring .
He had the jurisdiction to seek a search warrant and carry out the excavations without the FBI help but did not .
One day last summer , however , Cocina met with three FBI agents at their El Paso offices .
A person who took part in the meeting said Cocina laid out aerial photos and topographical maps of the Juarez region , which Mexican and American investigators had used to pinpoint graveyard sites .
After the meeting , the FBI agents requested help from Washington , and negotiations ensued with Mexico that led to the digging late this year at the grave site in Juarez .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- After a convoy of FBI forensic experts drove into Mexico on Nov. 29 , many Mexicans questioned why their government had allowed FBI agents to operate on Mexican soil .
`` It was obvious that the U.S. pressured Mexico to carry out the exhumations , '' Sen. Alfredo Aguilar Zinser , one of the operation 's most outspoken Mexican critics , said in an interview .
`` The Mexican attorney general allowed foreign agents into Mexico because he had n't done his own proper investigation .
Now we 're in the humiliating position of letting theU.S .
come in to do a job that he did n't do . ''
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- The day the exhumations began , an FBI agent made contact with Barragan 's sister , requesting dental records for her brother and husband .
Both men were in the Kentucky Bar that night and were never seen again .
None of the nine bodies has been positively identified , however , and the digging continues .
