<p><b>Section 7 - Narrative Description</b>
<p>&nbsp; The proposed district lies about one mile southwest of downtown
Chicago, and is composed of an area equaling three and one-half standard
city blocks subdivided by alleys and one-lane streets. Its geographic boundaries
are from Roosevelt Road south to Liberty and 14<sup>th</sup> Streets, and
from Union Street west to Halsted and Newberry Streets. This district is
comprised of contiguous and scattered buildings separated by some vacant
lots, generally creating a wall of buildings along its perimeter. The district
is primarily commercial, with Halsted Street being the main corridor of
commerce and a major north-south transportation route within the city as
well as a segment of a state route (Illinois State Route 1) which originates
at the southern Illinois-Ohio border and terminates at Lake Michigan on
the north side of Chicago. Adjacent to Halsted is Roosevelt Road which
is a main east-west transportation route recently extended to feed into
the re-routing of Lake Shore Drive in the mid-1990's. This modification
has resulted in redevelopment projects along Roosevelt Road that extend
from the recently established Museum Campus on the shores of Lake Michigan
at the southern terminus of Grant Park, to the Illinois Medical District
at Ogden Avenue. The proposed district is virtually midway between these
two points, the western point of which also demarcates the west campus
of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) which extends north from
Roosevelt Road. UIC’s east campus is located north of Roosevelt Road and
extends west from Halsted, immediately north of the proposed district.
The UIC has redeveloped property south of Roosevelt in a recent expansion
of a south campus which borders the proposed district, and the properties
within the proposed district are included in UIC's current redevelopment
plans.
<p>There are 50 commercial and mixed-use buildings in addition to one residential
building, one manufacturing building, and two churches within the proposed
district, interspersed by some vacant lots. Generally, the buildings along
Roosevelt Road and Halsted Street are large and deep, two- and three-story
commercial buildings; the buildings along Maxwell, O’Brien, 13<sup>th</sup>
and Union Streets are one-, two- and three-story narrow, mixed-use and
residential buildings (with the exception of Gethsemane Missionary Baptist
Church at 1352 S. Union Street and Creative Use Warehouse at 712 W. 13<sup>th</sup>
Street/713 W. O’Brien Street). There are no high-rise buildings in the
district; the steeple of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church on Roosevelt
Road is the tallest point located at the northwestern corner of the district.
<p>Vaulted sidewalks are paved and buildings are flush to the sidewalk
with street setbacks about 8 feet along Halsted, 10 feet along Maxwell
Street, and 12 feet along Roosevelt Road. Street widths are about 35 feet
on Halsted, 30 feet on Maxwell Street, and 50 feet on Roosevelt Road. The
nominated district includes the 700 block of Maxwell Street which remains
extant from the original street length extending from the South Branch
of the Chicago River west to Blue Island Street and intersecting sixteen
streets, when platted in 1849. This extant street section is the pavement
upon which the historic open-air market took place from before the turn
of the century to 1994. The intersection of the 700 block at Halsted Street
made it a key section of the Maxwell Street Market, and created a cornerstone
of Maxwell Street that has remained consistently active throughout the
history of the area’s street peddlers and street musicians, through to
today. Granite cobblestone exists beneath the current black-top pavement
and is exposed in some areas adjacent to the vaulted cement sidewalks.
The vaulted sidewalks cover a passageway that connects Maxwell and Halsted
Street buildings via basement doorways that lead into the unimproved route
below the sidewalk.
<p>The masonry buildings generally date from the early 1880s to the late
1920s and range from tenement dwellings to commercial block-type buildings
that are Art Deco or classically inspired. Two 3-story, contiguous tenements
at 727 and 729 W. Maxwell bear a flat tar roof and a gable roof, respectively,
that are typical of brick buildings built after the establishment of the
1881 municipal fire codes that mandated "...all tenements have circumscribing
walls of brick, stone, and other incombustible material." With the exception
of the one manufacturing building, the one residence, and the two churches,
all the buildings within the proposed district are storefronts, including
each extant building on Maxwell Street. Three frame buildings exist within
the proposed district and are likely the oldest buildings in the neighborhood,
and are typical of the earliest type of construction on Chicago’s west
side: 721 W. Maxwell has vertical sawn lumber in wall studs and ceiling
joists which indicate construction in the early 1860s during the Civil
War era; 716 and 800-808 W. Maxwell are both frame and clapboard buildings
believed to predate the Chicago Fire of 1871; 808 W. Maxwell is shown as
a stable on Robinson’s 1886 building outline map, the earliest building
outline map of the area. The contiguous group of buildings composing the
south side of Maxwell Street (711-743 W. Maxwell) present a chronological
series of building styles in Chicago and also reflect a chronology of Maxwell
Street’s development from a residential to a predominantly commercial street:
721 is the type of residential frame cottage built quickly and cheaply
in the 1860s and early 1870s to house incoming populations to the city;
717, 719, 727 and 729 brick storefronts replaced this type of frame construction
in the 1880s and 1890s as a result of municipal fire and health codes established
for building construction following the Chicago Fire of 1871 to remedy
the resultant overcrowded living conditions (due to the combination of
immigration rates and the relocation of residents and businesses to Chicago’s
Near West Side), and due to the fact that outdoor market activity which
occurred along the street made it sensible to build a "store and flat(s)"
as indicated on Robinson’s 1886 map so that merchants could live above
and behind their stores; 711-715 and 725 were built solely as stores in
the early 19-teens and 1920s and reflect the successful commercial viability
of Maxwell Street as the site of the open air market (established by a
city ordinance in 1912) and the fact that many of the merchants were beginning
to choose residences outside of the area while keeping businesses there;
and 733-737 and 739-743, built as commercial buildings with storage space,
reflect an increased lot size for buildings as they were located near to
and at the intersection of the commercially competitive Halsted Street,
which maximized property value and resulted in the design of multiple storefronts
within a street facade (733-737 has three separate storefronts; 739-743
has three separate storefronts each on the Maxwell Street and the Halsted
Street facades). The materials found in the Maxwell Street Market Historic
District are typical of their time period and location and are built mostly
of brick with stone, terra cotta, metal and cast iron details. Architectural
styles range from commercial vernacular to Classical Revival and Art Deco
throughout the proposed district, and the south side of Maxwell Street
represents a chronology of these building materials that range from the
earliest clapboard cottage, to the brick and cast iron storefront, to the
terra cotta tile and ornament of the commercial building. The present appearance
of many building facades along Halsted Street is the result of alterations
from the 1940s and 1950s.
<p>The buildings and streetscapes in the Maxwell Street Historic District
represent a significant part of Chicago's ethnic and commercial history
and retain sufficient integrity to be listed on the National Register.
In spite of alterations and demolition, a large concentration of historic
buildings remain that reflect its period of greatest activity and significance,
1870-1950. In addition, there are intact narrow alleyways that border the
rear of buildings and provide separations of buildings (particularly south
of Maxwell Street), and narrow, one-lane streets as laid out in the original
city grid system. Historically, the neighborhood supported a heavy population
of street peddlers reliant on horses, mules and carriages, and these alleyways
led to stables and small barns (no longer extant), or to out-keeping areas
for hitching horses and mules. Liberty Street, W. 12<sup>th</sup> Street,
and W. 13<sup>th</sup> Street are one-lane streets which are much narrower
in width than W. Maxwell and W. O’Brien Streets, while serving the same
purpose as a residential street. Liberty Street currently reveals historic
cobblestone beneath worn pavement, as does Maxwell Street in certain sections.
<p><b>1852-1870:</b>
<p>Maxwell Street originated at the south branch of the Chicago River and
intersected approximately sixteen streets to Blue Island Street. At its
eastern end, residential buildings were sparse, and industrial buildings
and a few grain elevators existed along the river. Railroads from the south
crossed Maxwell Street continuing northward. Three to five blocks westward,
Maxwell Street was more built-up and residential dwellings were particularly
dense at Jefferson Street. Streets were dirt and buildings were wood frame.
Irish and German immigrants inhabited the area, and a few churches were
built.
<p><b>1871-1890:</b>
<dir>
<dir>Housing of the area...(was) small cottages of wood and brick, at about
the time of the Chicago Fire, to two- and three-story clapboard buildings,
so narrow that the stairways had to be put on the outside.... The roofs
were "pitched"... (Berkow 1977:9)</dir>
</dir>
Russian Jewish immigrants attracted to the area left unscathed by the Chicago
Fire began to replace the German Jews and the Irish in the 1870s. Outdoor
marketing took place first along Jefferson Street, a north-south street
located one block east of the Maxwell Street Market Historic District.
<dir>
<dir>Street stretches beyond street of little houses, mostly wooden, begrimed
with soot, rotting, falling to pieces. The pathways are of rickety and
worm-eaten planks, such as we should not tolerate a day in London where
a house is being built...The streets are quagmires of black mud, and no
attempt is made to repair them. They are miserably lighted... (Mayer &amp;
Wade 1969:261).</dir>
</dir>
Pushcarts and vendors spilled over onto Maxwell Street, which was wider
and less congested than Jefferson with its trolley line. In front of the
storefronts along Maxwell Street, the pushcart trade prospered.
<p><b>1890-1920:</b>
<p>By the late 1890s, peddling activity was well established along Maxwell
Street and was particularly active between Jefferson and Halsted Streets.
<dir>
<dir>A line of fruit vendors sell at their street stands... Behind them
a produce company, a saloon, and a grocery line the sidewalk. Second floors
contained small apartments and furnished rooms for people working in and
near the area. (Mayer &amp; Wade 1969:261)</dir>
</dir>
To acknowledge its unique status and to regulate the street vendors, the
Chicago City Council passed an ordinance in 1912, recognizing the Maxwell
Street Market. Its boundaries were established as follows: The roadway
from curb line to curb line of West Maxwell Street from the west line of
South Jefferson Street to the east line of South Sangamon Street, except
the roadway of South Halsted Street, and of South Jefferson Street from
the south line of West Roosevelt Road to the north line of West 14<sup>th</sup>
Street, which shall be known as the Maxwell Street Market (Municipal Code
of Chicago [Chicago: Corporation Counsel, 1948], Schulz 1954:35.1-35.5).
<p>In reality, the market extended to include the retail stores immediately
adjacent to its curbs. "The average merchant moves his family into the
back rooms of a tumble-down building, puts wooden shutters on the front
windows, and spreads his stock-in trade on the pavement. There is more
room for haggling out of doors" (Berkow 1977:10). Realizing the permanence
and increased selling capacity of the stores, pushcart men began to establish
stands along the streets and to sell from storefronts. This was particularly
true with the clothing trade that was booming in the area at the turn of
the century, particularly on the 700 block of Maxwell Street and in the
vicinity of Maxwell Street along Halsted. Businesses became established
along Maxwell and Halsted Streets and Roosevelt Road.
<p>There was a hierarchy as far as shopping: Roosevelt Road had the wholesalers
which provided goods to the vendors and merchants in the area; and stores
along Halsted Street were basically one price shops with higher quality
goods, specialty items and restaurants. Maxwell Street retained its character
of small businesses, shops, and residences lined with pushcarts and street
stands, but it also had a few small, but very busy, department stores such
as Gabel’s, Robinson’s, and Mackevich’s. The neighborhood, which extended
from Taylor Street south to 15<sup>th</sup> Street, and from Canal Street
west to Ashland Street, was the most densely populated neighborhood in
Chicago. The center of commercial activity in this area was between Jefferson
Street (two blocks east of the nominated district) and Morgan Street, and
from Roosevelt Road to 14<sup>th</sup> Street, &frac12; block south of
the Maxwell Street Historic District.
<dir>
<dir>In the early 1900s many...buildings were replaced with the tenement...
They were usually three stories high, built with brick.... (Berkow 1977:9)
The buildings on Maxwell from Union to just past Halsted have stores on
the ground level and sometimes the second floor. The second and third floors
are often used for storage of merchandise or storage of impoverished tenants.
(Berkow 1977:27-28)</dir>
</dir>
The upper floors were often used for manufacturing, especially clothing,
as there were many sweat shops in the area. Many buildings have been joined
with others or have had portions removed, characteristic of the morphology
of an old and impoverished neighborhood. This is apparent throughout the
Maxwell Street Historic District. Many buildings have had rear additions
built to accommodate growing businesses, and some buildings had names inscribed
on their facades, such as Kresge, Sherman, and Lichtenberg, in recognition
of the businesses or business owners in occupance.
<dir>
<dir>As the population density of the West Side increased, frame houses
and warehouses were converted and partitioned to hold the newcomers....
The ghetto's focal point was the intersection of Halsted and Maxwell Streets.
Radiating from it was a conglomeration of houses, stores, shops, open stalls,
stables, peddlers carts, kosher butcher shops, dry good emporiums, matzo
bakeries, synagogues, sweat shops, tailor and seamstress shops, pawnshops,
secondhand stores, Hebrew schools, lawyer's and doctor's offices, marriage
arrangement bureaus, and approved circumcisers. From early morning to late
in the evening the streets were filled with people coming and going...
(Holli and d'A. Jones 1988:55)</dir>
</dir>
By 1910, an estimated 50,000 Jews lived in the area, and Roosevelt Road
was widened by 17 feet in 1911 to accommodate increasing traffic. Several
theaters and nickelodeons appeared and disappeared along Halsted Street
such as "The Ideal" (1228 S. Halsted) and the "The Irving" (1210 S. Halsted).
The Oscar winning actor, Paul Muni (Muni Weisenfreund), received his earliest
audiences by performing in this neighborhood where he was raised.
<p>The 7<sup>th</sup> District Police Station of the Chicago Police Department
on Maxwell St. at Morgan was built in 1888 and was the oldest building
in use by the Chicago Police Department at the time of its purchase by
the UIC in 1994. It is telling that a police station was located here in
the late 1880s at a time when rivaling ethnic gangs, primarily Jews, Italians,
and Greeks, were beginning to peak in the overcrowded and impoverished
neighborhood. The precinct station witnessed more serious crime by more
serious criminals following the turn of the century, as described below
by a former neighborhood resident, Ira Berkow:
<dir>
<dir>The precinct police station was on Maxwell Street three blocks west
of Halsted and 'on all sides of the station', wrote the Chicago Tribune,
'are corners, saloons, and houses that have seen the rise, the operations,
and often the death of some of the worst criminals the land has ever known.'
Two blocks from the station was the corner of Sangamon and Fourteenth Place
notorious for more than twenty-five years as 'dead man's corner.' More
criminals were shot by policemen and more policemen were shot by criminals
than any other location in Chicago. (Berkow 1977:12)</dir>
</dir>
It is also telling that noted health professionals, medical dispensaries,
settlement houses, and schools (no longer extant) were incubated during
this period on and near Maxwell Street to treat illness and assist in the
socialization of the largely immigrant neighborhood. Tuberculosis research
conducted by Dr. Theodore B. Sachs while Medical Director of the West Side
Free Dispensary, was recognized by the International Congress on Tuberculosis
in 1902 and was a historic achievement. The West Side Free Dispensary originated
on the property of the Jewish Training School at Clinton and Judd in 1894,
moved to Morgan and Maxwell in 1896, and finally relocated to Maxwell and
Peoria Street in the early 1900s until 1915 (all locations are outside
the proposed district but within the Maxwell Street neighborhood). Dr.
Joseph B. DeLee, who became one of the world’s most famous obstetricians,
started his Lying-in Hospital on Maxwell Street in 1896 to assist women
in birthing, prenatal and aftercare of their infants which made a significant
decrease in infant mortality. The Chicago Lying-in Hospital shared quarters
with the Marcy Center located on the southeast corner of Maxwell and Newberry
Streets (and later in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, relocated its dispensary
across the street to the northeast corner of Maxwell and Newberry, and
became known as the Chicago Maternity Center). Named for Elizabeth E. Marcy,
Marcy Center opened in 1896 and served as a settlement house and precursor
to the Jane Addams Hull-House. Elizabeth Marcy, a member of the Women’s
Home Missionary Society, opened two "homes" on Maxwell Street west of Halsted
before building on the corner at Maxwell and Newberry Streets. At Marcy
Center, immigrant families were assimilated into American life by industrial,
religious and Americanization classes. In 1898, it opened a medical dispensary,
and became known as the Marcy Center Dispensary. Dr. Max Thorek, who became
a noted professor of gynecological surgery, operated for a period of time
out of both the West Side Free Dispensary and the Lying-in Dispensary at
Marcy Center. One-half block north of the Marcy Center on the west side
of the street was the sixteen-classroom School of St. Francis built in
1881 to serve the parish of St. Francis of Assisi Church. One-half block
east of Halsted at 720 W. O’Brien was the Foster Elementary School, built
in 1857 as a twelve-classroom school building and the first brick school
building built by the Board of Education. Named after Dr. John H. Foster,
who was a member of the first Board of Education, the building served as
the longest standing public school in service in Chicago until it was leased
to the Chicago Police Department as a training center in the 1960s (the
building also served as a temporary hospital for Camp Douglas during the
Civil War). All of these buildings were demolished post-1950, and most
as a result of urban renewal by the City of Chicago.
<p><b>&nbsp;1920-1940:</b>
<p>By the 1920s, the Maxwell Street Historic District served the shopper
and consumer in various capacities. Street stands and small storefronts
along Maxwell Street offered goods and produce in the informal manner of
a bargaining bazaar. Halsted Street was more "upscale" than Maxwell Street
and was lined with slightly fancier stores, restaurants, and some department
stores. "Pullers" were employed by business owners on Halsted Street to
literally pull shoppers into the stores (this practice is now discontinued).
The second and third levels of most buildings were used as either apartments,
offices, shops, or storage. The buildings located at 1262 S. Halsted and
1200 S. Halsted are examples of this arrangement with Manny's Tailor Shop
located above MJ Sports in the Chatsman Building, and Irving Federman's
office, Attorney at Law, on the second level of Adam Joseph's shop in the
Turner Brothers building (respectively).
<p>Eventually, chain stores such as Woolworth's, Kresge's, Turner Brothers,
Howard's Style shops, Smokey Joe’s and Karoll's Men's Clothes lined the
street. People came from throughout the city to shop for specialty items,
rare and imported goods, and bargains in the shopping style that the Maxwell
Street Historic District offered. In 1926, the straightening of the south
branch of the Chicago River eliminated approximately three blocks of Maxwell
Street's easternmost section without affecting the area's commercial activity
between Jefferson and Halsted Streets. At the northeast corners of Halsted
and 14<sup>th</sup> St., and at Halsted and Roosevelt, were two of the
largest department stores in the area (no longer extant): L. Klein Department
Store and the Twelfth Street Store (respectively).
<p>Stores such as Jerry's, Breyer’s and Alan’s Clothing located along Halsted
are strong examples of buildings of moderate size but boasting fanciful
Art Deco stylistic treatment in terra cotta. In the 1920s, the Halsted
commercial strip extended for several blocks south and north of Roosevelt
Road, and east and west of Halsted along Roosevelt Road. The Maxwell Street
area grossed one to two million dollars per month in sales, and was rated
third in sales activity in the city of Chicago, the first being the downtown
"loop" on State Street (the Loop Retail Historic District was placed on
the National Register in 1998), followed by the shopping area at Halsted
and 63<sup>rd</sup> Streets. (Cutler, Maxwell Street Market Colloquium
1993).
<p>Since the turn of the century, commercial entrepreneurs have continued
the tradition of starting out in business by vending on the street at a
table or street stand, then opening a small store on Maxwell Street, and
then "moving-up" into a larger store on Halsted Street or Roosevelt Road.
Many prosperous Chicago area businessmen and businesses got their start
on Maxwell, Roosevelt, and Halsted Streets and include Gene and Joe Silverberg
of Bigsby and Kruthers, Morrie Mages of Mages Sporting Goods, Chernin’s
Shoes, Karoll's Men's Clothes, Keeshin Bus Lines, Vienna Beef, Kuppenheimer's,
Meyer Meystel's, Turner Bros., Smokey Joe's, and Pepi's and Flukey’s fast-food
restaurants. (Cutler, Maxwell Street Market Colloquium). The Chicago originator
of the "zoot suit," Hal Fox, was a band leader who operated a third generation
tailor shop in the Maxwell Street neighborhood immediately east of the
district on Roosevelt Road (the family business is extant today). Zoot
suits were sold copiously in Halsted Street clothing stores in the 1940s
and 1950s, within the district.
<p>The intersection of Maxwell and Halsted Streets is famous for its "hot
dog", polish sausage and pork chop sandwiches that are found at the two
hot dog stands on the northwest corner, and the one stand one block south
at Liberty Street. The stands are located in buildings, and Jim’s has been
a "landmark" since the 1920s. The tradition of selling hot dogs in this
neighborhood stems from the Vienna Beef (formerly Vienna Sausage) manufacturing
business which started at 1213 S. Halsted Street in 1893 and remained in
the neighborhood until 1972. The company aggressively sought hot dog stand
vendors and not only helped them to establish locations but provided advertising
for their Vienna products. The young company established their earliest
"peddler routes" in the immediate neighborhood of Maxwell Street, which
served as the patterning for their city-wide, and later, nation-wide business.
Today, Vienna Beef takes credit for the Chicago Style hot dog which originated
in the Maxwell Street neighborhood.
<p>The Maxwell Street Civic Improvement Project of 1939 sought to take
actions "for the furtherance, improvement, and betterment of conditions
as they relate to real estate and business interests...", and was part
of a larger campaign inaugurated by the Real Estate and Business Men's
Research Institute of America. The project resulted in an effort to standardize
push-cart and street stand construction, and to generally beautify storefronts
with new awnings and a cleaned-up appearance for a more "modern" look.
The character of most Maxwell Street buildings today reflects this "facelift."
One of the earliest achievements of the project was the removal of the
entry for the Maxwell Street Market as the "Ghetto Market" from the city’s
Yellow Pages. The Maxwell Street Merchants Association supported this improvement
project into the 1940s, during which time the organization took residence
in the building at 720-724 W. Maxwell, (the building, formerly the site
of the NABISCO factory, was destroyed by fire in 1999). Their choice to
locate their headquarters in the middle of the 700 block of Maxwell Street
is telling of the concentrated marketing of general merchandise and clothing
on the block. At that time, the block housed multiple clothing stores,
Gabel’s department store (733-737 W. Maxwell), a sporting goods store,
a luggage store, and a toy store.
<p><b>1940-present:</b>
<p>The massive migrations of African-Americans from the south began to
replace the Jewish community in the Maxwell Street Historic District who
had moved north and west by the 1940s. Although Jewish business owners
lived elsewhere, they maintained their businesses in the area and were
supported by clientele who came from outside the neighborhood. Several
of the retail buildings along Halsted were covered by metal siding in the
late 1950s and early 1960s, and entrance-ways to most buildings along Halsted
were altered. Terrazzo tiled entrance floors display former business names
for Smokey Joe’s, Turner Brothers, Wexler Bros., Original Goldberg, Maremont,
Chatsman and Goldenberg Furniture, and "1228" and "1226" street addresses.
Fire damage accounts for the cosmetic rehabilitation that has occurred
to some buildings since the 1970s.
<p>In 1957, Maxwell Street suffered the elimination of its entire eastern
segment east of Union Street by the construction of the south Dan Ryan
expressway. The area north of Roosevelt was cleared to make way for the
new campus of the University of Illinois in the 1960s, and on the east
by more recent development of a United Parcel Service facility. In 1966,
the Roosevelt - Halsted area was designated a slum and blighted area by
the Department of Urban Renewal and the remaining neighborhood buildings
began to be removed. The intersections of Roosevelt and Halsted, and Maxwell
and Halsted, continued to be the hub of commercial activity and congestion
through to the 1980s when Asian-American businessmen joined old establishments
along Roosevelt and Halsted, and African-Americans continued the tradition
of street peddling. The built fabric of these streets served as the electricity
source and stage for Chicago’s first electrified blues musicians. As recent
as the 1990s, a permanent stage set up between street stands in front of
729 W. Maxwell continued to support blues musicians during the Sunday market
on Maxwell Street (all street stands were cleared as a result of the relocation
of the market in 1994), and the street pavement and empty lots continued
to serve market visitors graced by wandering blues musicians.
<p>Today, the street pavement of Maxwell Street extends from Union Street
to Newberry Street, one block west of Halsted. The area being nominated
to the National Register includes the 700 block of Maxwell Street which
is bounded by the Dan Ryan expressway on the east and the UIC athletic
fields and two UIC athletic buildings on the west. The Barbara Jean Wright
Courts (subsidized housing complexes) occupy the westernmost section of
Maxwell Street between Morgan and Blue Island (it is no longer a through
street). The UIC acquired the Maxwell Street 7<sup>th</sup> District Police
Station (located west of the district at Maxwell and Morgan Streets) in
1994 and it was listed on the National Register in 1996. A UIC parking
lot occupies the south side of Maxwell Street west of Halsted. Buildings
on Maxwell Street that are owned by the UIC are boarded and/or gated with
locks; buildings that are privately owned are still in use by tenants and
business owners. Vacant lots that are owned by the UIC for its south campus
expansion are fenced in, and privately owned vacant lots are open.
<p>Over the past five years, the Creative Use Warehouse together with Chicago
Greens and Maxworks Cooperatives (three nonprofit organizations housed
in the proposed district for the purpose of recycling and storage of materials)
have collaborated to create, cultivate and maintain a public garden that
occupies four vacant lots on the southwest corner of Union and 13<sup>th</sup>
Streets, and also extends into one narrow lot on the north side of Maxwell
Street. The Creative Use Warehouse is utilized heavily by Chicago’s museums
and Board of Education as a resource outlet and materials repository. The
vacant lot on the northeast corner of Maxwell and Halsted Streets that
extends eastward on Maxwell Street serves as an outdoor music stand for
weekend blues musicians and blues audiences. The performing blues musicians
are commonly those who performed at the Maxwell Street open air market
before it was relocated outside the area in 1994.
<p>Halsted remains active seven days a week from Roosevelt south to just
north of 14<sup>th</sup> Street. Currently, ninety-two businesses are in
operation within the proposed district, ranging from general merchandise,
food stands, tailor shops, to clothing and shoe stores. The diversity of
these businesses spans the range that has historically existed in the buildings,
and indications of former businesses are extant on facades, windows, doorways,
and entranceways. "Maxwell Music" remains advertised on the storefront
at 729 W. Maxwell, in front of where the blues stage formerly stood. In
many cases, extant businesses and buildings are owned and operated by second
and third generation members of a family, such as Paul and Bill’s Tailor
Shop, Sandy’s Clothing, Breyer’s, Alan’s Clothing, Paul’s Clothing, Al-Rob’s
Fashions, Adam Joseph’s Men’s Clothes, and the residence on O’Brien Street.
<p>The wide street width of Maxwell Street and its wide sidewalks have
historically accommodated heavy pedestrian traffic, however, today most
buildings on Maxwell Street have been purchased by the university which,
in effect, has caused the closure of many businesses and substantially
reduced foot traffic on the street. Most university-owned buildings were
being demolished on Maxwell Street until temporarily halted by a moratorium
requested by the organizers of the Maxwell Street Market Colloquium in
1993 (a symposium on the significance of the Maxwell Street Market, held
at the UIC); currently, no demolition has occurred in the proposed district
since 1997 except for buildings damaged as a result of fire. Paul and Bill’s
tailor shop at 729 W. Maxwell and Jim’s Red Hots at 800-808 W. Maxwell
(at Halsted Street) still thrive and continue to draw old and new customers
since the 1940s. Sidewalk vending continues to occur in front of privately
owned lots and in front of the two residences at 716 and 717 W. Maxwell.
The <u>Historic Maxwell Street Neighborhood Tour</u> is conducted monthly
in the spring, summer and fall by the Chicago Architecture Foundation (CAF)
since 1996, during which trained CAF docents lead two-hour walking tours
of the proposed district. The <u>Historic Maxwell Street Neighborhood Tour</u>
is among seven CAF tours selected to participate with the City of Chicago’s
Department of Cultural Affairs’ "Great Places and Spaces" weekend event
in May 2000, during which city trolleys will transport tourists to CAF
walking tour locations.
<p>The contiguous stretches of historic buildings in the proposed district
are along the east and west sides of Halsted Street from Roosevelt to Liberty
and 14<sup>th</sup> Streets, along the south side of Roosevelt Road, and
along the south side of Maxwell Street from Union Street to Halsted Street.
These buildings and a few scattered buildings (on Union, 13<sup>th</sup>,
and O’Brien Streets, and on the north side of Maxwell Street) are being
nominated to the National Register. Many buildings purchased by the UIC,
particularly on Maxwell Street and extending one block north and south
on Halsted Street from Maxwell Street, have become vacant and are boarded
up. Most buildings along Halsted Street are still privately owned, are
occupied and maintained, and some have recent improvements. Major interior
rehabilitations have occurred at some stores on Halsted Street and most
recently on the interior of the residential building at 711 W. O’Brien
Street in 1999.
<p><b>Architecture:</b>
<p>The extant architectural styles in the Maxwell Street Historic District
are varied. The architects who contributed to the development of the Maxwell
Street Historic District include Henry Dubin, Alexander Levy, Alfred Alschuler,
and Merrit Morehouse and David Klafter. Henry Dubin was from a Jewish immigrant
family and designed buildings throughout Chicago in the early 1900s. While
in partnership with Eisenberg, he designed the Art Deco building located
at 1247-1249 S. Halsted, and the Spanish Revival Pollack and Sons building
located at 723-725 W. Roosevelt. On Halsted Street, Jerry's Clothing and
Breyer’s are fine examples of Art Deco facades designed by Dubin and Eisenberg,
and the architectural plans for each are housed in the archives of the
Chicago Historical Society. Alexander Levy was very active as an architect
in the Jewish community, including the Maxwell Street area and nearby neighborhoods
from 1920s through the 1930s. He designed buildings at 701-709 and 729
W. Roosevelt. Also on Halsted Street is an ornate fa&ccedil;ade designed
by Henry Newhouse at 1311-13 S. Halsted, exposed when the metal siding
was removed following a fire in the neighboring building in 1998. The eastern
(rear) section of 1311-13 S. Halsted became damaged as a result of city
workers’ error while attempting to demolish the fire-damaged building next
door. Diagonally south across the street from this building on Maxwell
Street is a white terra cotta fa&ccedil;ade suggestive of Art Deco designed
by Merrit Morehouse who was trained at the University of Illinois and in
Paris prior to the full emergence of this style in Chicago. The building
at 1215-1217 S. Halsted with a gleaming white terra cotta facade designed
by Alfred Alschuler in 1924, was the operating site of the Vienna Beef
company for more than a half-century and was demolished in 1997 after becoming
acquired by the UIC. (This was the second location of Vienna Beef on S.
Halsted Street where the nationally successful company operated from 1907
to the 1970s, after which it relocated to a larger facility outside the
neighborhood on Damen Avenue; Alexander Levy had designed the 1907 alterations
to initially convert the storefront for manufacturing purposes.)
<p>With the exception of 733-737 W. Maxwell (designed by Merrit Morehouse),
buildings along Maxwell Street are less grand and more likely to have been
designed by builders rather than architects. All were built as storefronts
and dwellings with the exception of two one-story storefronts built in
the early 19-teens. By that time, the commercial value of Maxwell Street
was a well-known fact and buildings built solely for commercial use were
constructed, if the opportunity presented itself. 717 W. Maxwell, an 1883
storefront building, is noteworthy in that it still has a rear building
on the plat. Its fa&ccedil;ade was redesigned by David Klafter in an ornate
brick pattern which bear the initials ("F&amp;B") of the building’s then
owners, Farber and Wittenberg, who utilized the building as a store and
rented out the upper residence.
<p>The Maxwell Street neighborhood contained as many as forty synagogues
at one time (Cutler, Maxwell Street Market Colloquium) and many Episcopal
and Catholic Churches, but only two religious structures remain standing
today. The Gethsemane Baptist Church was originally built as a frame, German
Catholic Church in 1863 and was then converted to a Jewish synagogue by
1898. In 1902 it became the First Romanian Synagogue for the area, until
it was again converted to a Baptist Church in 1944. Now covered in brick
veneer, it is suspected that the original frame structure exists beneath
its current walls; its interior retains its original form. St. Francis
of Assisi Church, rebuilt in 1904 in the Romanesque style and constructed
of Bedford limestone retains the apse from its original 1866 construction
at this site, and withstood a move thirty-two feet south to accommodate
the second widening of Roosevelt Road (12<sup>th</sup> Street) in 1917,
and continues Catholic services today to more than 5000 parishioners. The
congregation has created its own Preservation Committee and is actively
committed to the restoration of the church since its near demolition by
the Archdiocese in 1995. St. Francis of Assisi parish is currently rebuilding
its rectory and commons immediately east of the church, to replace the
structure they elected to raze in 1999.
<p>Between 1983-1992, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (CCL) conducted
a survey of historic buildings, funded with federal money and foundation
grants. During that time, this survey cited buildings in the Maxwell Street
Historic District with architectural significance defined as a "structure
possessing historical or architectural significance in the context of the
immediate community." Extant buildings cited on the CCL survey are noted
on the list of Contributing Buildings that follows.
<p><b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>In 1994, Archaeological Research, Inc. prepared the <u>Phase One Archaeological
and Historical Evaluation of the Maxwell Street Area</u>, as a consultant
to the University of Illinois. In the section entitled, "Preliminary Analysis
of Integrity," the report states the following:
<p>By placing properties within a broader historic context, one may determine
that the practice of demolishing parts of buildings and constructing new
additions and facades is consistent with the historic development of the
area...This process may result in the determination that some storefronts
from the late 1940s and 1950s are significant." (Integrity of Design, pg.
58)
<p>The degree to which the project area retains integrity of materials
is an issue that may be worthy of additional research. It is clear that
the entire continuum of history of the project area is reflected by the
historic materials that continue to be visible. Other historic materials
are obscured by artificial siding. In many cases, there is strong evidence
that the historic facades are intact beneath the siding. A more detailed
field analysis of existing materials would not only yield information about
the facades beneath artificial siding. It would also generate additional
information about the buildings dating between the 1860s and 1910s that
represent layers of construction. (Integrity of Materials, pg. 61)
<p>In spite of all the demolition within the project area, and changes
to its setting over time, the area strongly possesses the integrity of
feeling...National Register Bulletin #15 defines the integrity of feeling
as "a property's expression for the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular
period of time (1982:45) (Integrity of Feeling, pg. 62)
<p>In the final narrative section (Conclusions and Final Recommendations,
pg. 65), the report states that:
<p>Evidence uncovered in this study suggests that the project area which
contains the Maxwell Street neighborhood has sufficient significance to
warrant listing as an historic district on the National Register of Historic
Places.
<p>In 1994, the <u>Phase One Archaeological and Historical Evaluation</u>
of the Maxwell Street Area cited fifty-four buildings as "...contributing
features to a potential National Register Historic District." The report
also acknowledged that,
<p>...consultation between the University of Illinois at Chicago and the
Illinois Historic Preservation Agency is needed in order to determine the
fate of this potential historic district.
<p>Six years later at the beginning of the new millennium, forty-four buildings
remain as contributing structures to a potential National Register Historic
District. The preparers of this nomination form propose that the extant
buildings in this proposed district be preserved as part of the university’s
plan for redevelopment, and that the UIC’s educational goals include the
history of this entrepreneurial, culturally diverse, and ethnically rich
area. We consider its longstanding part in Chicago’s history to be a reflection
of national movements and developments during its period of significance.
Since the Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the historic fabric of the
proposed district as a part of a much larger area has remained substantially
intact and today contains sufficient integrity to convey the historic character
of its streetscapes, commerce, and resonating blues music.
