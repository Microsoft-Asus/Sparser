___ BOGOTA , Colombia -LRB- AP -RRB- -- A 29-year -old accused of shipping 10-15 kilograms -LRB- about 25 pounds -RRB- of heroin a week to U.S. cities will be the first Colombian extradited to the United States under a year -old law , police said Monday .
Jaime `` Jimmy '' Orlando Lara , who was arrested in Bogota on Saturday night , headed a heroin distribution ring with outlets in Houston , Miami and New York , said Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano , the national police director .
`` I think he will be the first Colombian -born person extradited to the United States for drug trafficking because the evidence is overwhelming , '' Serrano told reporters .
A December 1997 law restored extradition of Colombian citizens for trial abroad .
The country 's 1991 constitution , enshrined during a bloody war with the late Medellin drug cartel , had prohibited it .
The new law is not retroactive , however , meaning Colombians can only be extradited for crimes committed after its enactment .
Cali cartel bosses Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez , who were captured in 1995 and are imprisoned in Colombia , were thereby exempt .
Had they been convicted in the United States , the two could have expected to receive life sentences without the possibility of parole .
As it stands , both could be paroled in about 10 years .
