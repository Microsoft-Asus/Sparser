Ascomycetes include some of the most devastating plant pathogens, which will be discussed later in the chapter. However, many are important saprobes, particularly of plant material. About half the ascomycete species live with algae in the mutualistic associations called lichens. Some ascomycetes form mycorrhizae with plants. Others live between mesophyll cells in leaves, apparently helping to protect the plant tissues from insects by releasing toxic compounds.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig31-9','../fig/big/fig31-9.jpg','fig31-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig31-9.jpg" alt="fig31-9" name="myfig31-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 31-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Ascomycetes (sac fungi).</span> The "fruiting" (sexual) structures of ascomycetes are called ascocarps.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The defining feature of the Ascomycota is the production of sexual spores in saclike <span class="Emphasis2">asci</span> (singular, <span class="Emphasis2">ascus</span>).

Such naked spores are called <span class="Emphasis2">conidia,</span> from the Greek for "dust."</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Compared to zygomycetes, ascomycetes are characterized by a more extensive heterokaryotic stage, which is associated with the formation of ascocarps (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.10</span>). Plasmogamy between specialized regions of two parental hyphae produces a heterokaryotic bulge called the ascogonium. The coenocytic ascogonium extends hyphae partitioned by septa into dikaryotic cells, each with two haploid nuclei representing the two parental mycelia. It is the cells at the tips of these dikaryotic hyphae that develop into asci. Within an ascus, karyogamy combines the two parental genomes, and then meiosis forms four genetically varied ascospores. One mitotic division doubles the ascospore number to eight. In many asci, the eight ascospores are lined up in a row in the order in which they formed from a single zygotic nucleus. This arrangement provides geneticists with a unique opportunity to study genetic recombination. Genetic differences between mycelia grown from ascospores taken from one ascus reflect crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig31-10','../fig/big/fig31-10.jpg','fig31-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig31-10.jpg" alt="fig31-10" name="myfig31-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 31-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The life cycle of an ascomycete.</span> (In this case, the key to color coding relates to structures rather than to portions of the life cycle.)

		 Haploid mycelia of opposite mating types become intertwined and form an ascogonium and an antheridium. 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk2.gif">&nbsp;
		A cytoplasmic bridge forms, allowing plasmogamy (cytoplasmic fusion) to occur. The ascogonium acts as a "female," receiving haploid nuclei from the "male" antheridium. The ascogonium then has a pool of nuclei from both parents, but karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) does not occur at this time. 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk3.gif">&nbsp;
		 The ascogonium gives rise to dikaryotic hyphae that are incorporated into an ascocarp, the cup of a cup fungus (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.9a</span>). 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk4.gif">&nbsp;
		The tips of the ascocarp’s dikaryotic hyphae are partitioned into asci (singular, ascus).

		Karyogamy occurs within these asci, and the diploid nucleus divides by meiosis,

		yielding four haploid nuclei. 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk7.gif">&nbsp;
		Each of these haploid nuclei divides once by mitosis, and the ascus now contains eight nuclei. Cell walls develop around these nuclei to form ascospores. (The LM shows a mature ascus with eight ascospores.) 
			&nbsp;<img align="middle" src="../img/sym/disk8.gif">&nbsp;
		When mature, all ascospores in an ascus are dispersed at once out the end of the ascus. A collapsing ascus jars neighboring asci and causes them to release their spores. The chain reaction releases a visible cloud of spores with an audible hiss.
