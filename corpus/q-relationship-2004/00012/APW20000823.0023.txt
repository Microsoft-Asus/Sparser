WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- --<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL"> Federal investigators say an explosion of vapors in the fuel tank caused TWA Flight 800 to plunge into the ocean , killing all 230 passengers aboard , but four years after the crash they are still unable to pinpoint what ignited the blast .</ENAMEX>
A solid body of circumstantial evidence points to an electrical short as the cause , but there was not enough wire recovered from the wreckage to know for sure , said Robert Swaim of the National Transportation Safety Board .
`` I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of wire and say , ` Here it is . ' ''
said Swaim , who spent four years looking for the source of the ignition .
Swaim 's conclusions came Tuesday on the first day of a two-day meeting to study investigators ' reports on the crash and its cause .
The hearing will continue Wednesday with a discussion on maintenance of the nation 's aging fleet of aircraft and the observations of witnesses who claim they saw Flight 800 explode and crash into the waters off Long Island , N.Y. A number of possible causes of the explosion were considered , including problems with the main landing gear , static electricity , a small explosive charge , a missile and a meteorite strike , he said .
Investigators zeroed in on the short circuit because of a combination of factors which , taken together , were telling .
A crew member was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder remarking on the fuel flow indicator swaying crazily shortly before the crash .
A buzz on the cockpit voice recorder went silent in the moments before the crash .
Additionally , there had been recent problems with lights on the plane .
While wiring inside the fuel tank is very low voltage those wires are bundled together with higher voltage wires and a short could have been carried into the fuel tank , investigators said .
Air and fuel had been heated by an air conditioner positioned underneath the tank while the plane was delayed for three hours prior to takeoff .
That helped to make the tank volatile when it climbed in altitude , NTSB investigator Joseph Kolly said .
Given those conditions , a spark as weak as the static electricity transferred between a person 's hand a metal doorknob would have been sufficient for an explosion , Kolly said .
TWA Flight 800 went down shortly after leaving New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport on July 17 , 1996 , bound for Paris .
The crash has spawned a host of conspiracy theories , the most prevalent being that a bomb or a missile brought down the plane .
Some still contend the government is trying to cover up the real cause , and one group , calling itself the TWA 800 Eyewitness Alliance , ran a full-page ad in Tuesday 's Washington Times insisting missiles were to blame .
NTSB Chairman James Hall on Tuesday chastised those who continue to push those theories .
The FBI , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and his investigators all failed to find evidence of a bomb or missile blast , he said .
Bernard Loeb , aviation safety director of the National Transportation Safety Board , said that bomb and missile blasts leave distinct patterns .
`` High -energy explosions leave distinctive damage signatures such as severe pitting , cratering , hot gas washing , and petaling .
No such damage was found on any portion of the recovered airplane structure , '' Loeb said .
The physical evidence `` leads to the inescapable conclusion that the cause of the in-flight breakup of TWA Flight 800 was a fuel-air explosion inside the center wing tank , '' Loeb said .
John Seaman of Albany , N. Y. , who lost his 19-year -old niece Michelle Becker of St. Petersburg , Fla. , was at the hearing in Washington , along with more than 75 relatives of victims .
`` This speculation still that this was a missile is making all of us crazy , '' Seaman said .
`` It makes us feel like there is someone walking around today laughing about the death of our loved ones .
If all they can come up with is a probable cause then that is all that can be done . ''
