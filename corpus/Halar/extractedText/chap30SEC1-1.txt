OVERVIEW OF SEED PLANT EVOLUTION

 

 Reduction of the gametophyte continued with the evolution of seed plants



 

 Seeds became an important means of dispersing offspring



 

 Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization



 

 The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms



Seed plants are vascular plants that produce seeds. Modifications in life cycles contributed to the success of seed plants as terrestrial organisms. Here we examine the three most important reproductive adaptations: continued reduction of the gametophyte, the advent of the seed, and the evolution of pollen.
