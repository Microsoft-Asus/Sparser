-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Ailing Czech President Vaclav Havel , the Colombian children 's peace movement and players in the Northern Ireland peace process are seen as among the top contenders for this year 's Nobel Peace Prize .
That 's to the extent that anything at all can be seen about the secrecy-cloaked prize process .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee reveals next to nothing about the process , confirming only the number of nominees made by the Feb. 1 deadline -- a record 139 this year .
Even that number is n't definitive , because committee members themselves can make nominations later .
Some nominees become known because whoever nominated them will announce it ; but others remain as close-mouthed as the committee .
This year 's prize will be announced Oct. 16 and is worth 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 975,000 -RRB- .
Havel is a confirmed nominee and may have a strong chance , for reasons both pleasant and unpleasant .
Giving the prize to the noted human rights champion could be a way for the prize to mark this year 's 50th anniversary of the United Nations Human Rights Charter .
Plus , Havel has had serious health problems recently and the prize is not awarded posthumously .
Previous prize-winners are among those who can make nominations and 1996 laureate Jose Ramos Horta has proposed the approximately 3 million Colombian children in the movement trying to end the country 's three-decade-long civil war .
Norway 's NTB news agency , an astute observer of the prizes , has suggested that a top contender may be someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace process .
It is one of the few notable successes in peace efforts this year .
In recent years the tendency has been toward not giving the prize to mediators , such as in 1994 when the prize went to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , his foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat for the Middle East peace accord .
The Norwegian mediators who brokered the agreement were not included .
Giving the peace prize to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Ulster Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume would certainly not be any less controversial .</ENAMEX>
Another way to honor the Human Rights Charter could be to give the prize to the International War Crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , an award which could be interpreted as a boost to the work for a permanent international war crimes court .
Last summer it was agreed to establish such a court , but key countries like the United States and China opposed it .
Other candidates who have been among the favorites the last few years , and are thought to be on the list again , are Kurdish activist Leyla Zana , who was just given another two years on top of the 15-year sentence she is serving in a Turkish jail , and Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng .
Organizations that could be honored include the medical charity Doctors without Borders and The Salvation Army , both of which have been mentioned among the front-runners for several years .
As usual a long list of presidents , religious leaders and charities are also on the list , such as the presidents of South Korea , Kim Dae - Jung , and Taiwan , Lee Teng -hui .
