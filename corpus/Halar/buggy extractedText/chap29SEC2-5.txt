 Alternation of generations in plants may have originated by delayed meiosis

The charophyceans Chara and Coleochaete are haploid organisms. There is no sporophyte generation, though these algae do retain and seem to nourish zygotes on the parental bodies, as do the gametophytes of land plants. The main difference is that the zygote of a charophycean undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores, while the zygote of a plant undergoes mitosis to produce a multicellular sporophyte, which in turn produces haploid spores by meiosis. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis for the origin of plant sporophytes is that genetic change (mutations) in an ancestral charophycean caused a delay in meiosis until one or more mitotic divisions of the zygote had occurred (FIGURE 29.13). The result would be a multicellular, diploid sporophyte. This would increase the number of cells that undergo meiosis and thus increase the number of spores produced per zygote. Some botanists speculate that such an evolutionary breakthrough was an important adaptation for maximizing the output of sexual reproduction from each zygote on land, where a shortage of water decreased the probability of swimming sperm fertilizing eggs.

Fig 29-13. A hypothetical mechanism for the origin of alternation of generations in the ancestor of plants. Meiosis in a multicellular sporophyte, rather than direct meiosis by the zygote, would increase the number of haploid offspring (gametophytes) possible from each sexual union of sperm and ovum.
