-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The muted rumble that heaved plumes of dust into the air in a remote patch of Indian desert two years ago also sent political shock waves around the world .
With its nuclear weapons tests on May 11 , 1998 , India became an uninvited member of an elite club of nations that had openly wielded the bomb .
By the end of the same month , India 's rival Pakistan had also knocked loudly on the clubhouse door with its own underground nuclear explosions .
But the consensus among defense and disarmament analysts is that a full-blown nuclear arms race in South Asia has yet to materialize .
Despite bitter tensions over the disputed territory of Kashmir , which nearly pushed India and Pakistan into a fourth war last year , the two countries `` have not moved very far or in any significant fashion '' to field nuclear weapons , said Stephen Cohen , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
Cohen , a former State Department official and presidential adviser on South Asian affairs , said technical difficulties , disagreements over control of the weapons , inadequate early warning systems and political considerations all may have slowed the deployment of nuclear-armed air and missile forces .
`` Both countries have very weak command-and-control structures when it comes to nuclear weapons and also fairly bad intelligence generally , '' he said .
`` I think there are very strong military incentives not to deploy to a hair-trigger stance . ''
There also is the issue of control .
In India , a centralized command under the civilian government will almost certainly call the shots , Cohen said .
In smaller Pakistan , however , fears that military and political structures would be overwhelmed in a first strike could lead to the delegation of authority to local commanders -- a potentially dangerous scenario given the possibility of false warnings and the extremely limited response time .
During the Cold War , the United States and the Soviet Union enjoyed the luxury of as much as an hour to verify a nuclear strike , but because of missile flight times between targets in India and Pakistan , `` these guys have only about three minutes or 30 seconds , '' Cohen said .
For safety reasons , the region 's delivery systems -- aircraft and missiles -- are most likely being kept in different locations than the bombs themselves , said P.R. Chari , the director of the New Delhi -based Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies .
`` But of course , they could be brought together very quickly , '' he added .
Both nations have ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons , but many analysts believe Indian and Pakistani scientists are still struggling to produce suitable nuclear warheads for them -- a more complex task than simply building a Hiroshima -type bomb .
`` For the moment , we are talking only about air-dropped weapons , '' said A. Nayyar , a physicist at Islamabad 's Qaid -e- Azam University .
`` Although the weapon-makers have said that nuclear warheads have been mated with missiles , it seems unlikely at this point . ''
Cohen said in the case of India , `` there 's no evidence of a functioning missile delivery force .
It 's still largely on paper and several years down the road . ''
Following India 's 1998 nuclear test -- its first since 1974 -- the United States moved quickly to condemn the action and lobbied hard to prevent Pakistan from following suit .
But since the explosions , political factors have played a key role in restraining an unbridled exuberance for deployment , especially in India .
Having become `` deeply engaged '' with Washington , New Delhi has probably decided `` it 's worth going slow on weapons development '' Cohen said .
India has pledged `` no first use '' and says it wants only enough weapons for a `` minimum deterrence '' against a possible Pakistani or Chinese first strike .
Pakistan has declined to rule out first use and says it needs the bomb to offset India 's superior nuclear and conventional forces .
Both have steadfastly refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons .
At the United Nations , where the treaty is under review , Undersecretary - General for Disarmament Jayantha Dhanapala expressed hope that if the two countries have n't yet deployed that `` in this interim period ... the international community can have an effect on these decisions . ''
But the situation may be only a small window of opportunity for mature nuclear states to usher India and Pakistan safely into their club .
With relations between the two antagonists at their worst in decades , fighting in Kashmir threatens to ignite wider hostilities .
`` Nobody 's going to wake up and say ` Let 's go nuke ` em , ' '' cautions George Perkovich , director of the Secure World Program at the W. Alton Jones Foundation and author of `` India 's Nuclear Bomb . ''
`` What you have to worry about is that they have another kind of conflict and it escalates , '' he said .
