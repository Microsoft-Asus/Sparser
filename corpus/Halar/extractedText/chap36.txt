Chapter 36: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

AN OVERVIEW OF TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN PLANTS

   Transport at the cellular level depends on the selective permeability of membranes

   Proton pumps play a central role in transport across plant membranes

   Differences in water potential drive water transport in plant cells

   Aquaporins affect the rate of water transport across membranes

   Vacuolated plant cells have three major compartments

   Both the symplast and the apoplast function in transport within tissues and organs

   Bulk flow functions in long-distance transport



ABSORPTION OF WATER AND MINERALS BY ROOTS

   Root hairs, mycorrhizae, and a large surface area of cortical cells enhance water and mineral absorption

   The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue



TRANSPORT OF XYLEM SAP

   The ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on transpiration and the physical properties of water

   Xylem sap ascends by solar-powered bulk flow: a review



THE CONTROL OF TRANSPIRATION

   Guard cells mediate the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise

   Xerophytes have evolutionary adaptations that reduce transpiration



TRANSLOCATION OF PHLOEM SAP

   Phloem translocates its sap from sugar sources to sugar sinks

   Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms

The algal ancestors of plants were completely immersed in water and dissolved minerals, and none of their cells were far from these ingredients. The evolutionary journey onto land involved the differentiation of the plant body into roots, which absorb water and minerals from soil, and shoots, which are exposed to light and atmospheric CO2. This body plan enabled plants to survive in an environment where chemical resources are divided between two media, soil and air. But the morphological solution to a dual environment posed a new problem: the need to transport materials between roots and shoots, sometimes over long distances. For example, the leaves of the eucalyptus trees in the photograph above are more than 100 m from the roots. These remote organs are bridged by vascular tissues that transport sap throughout the plant body. The mechanisms responsible for this internal transport are the subject of this chapter.
