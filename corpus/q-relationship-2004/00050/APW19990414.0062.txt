LOS ANGELES
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Mexican bank officials charged in the United States ' largest money laundering probe were naive , terrified or simply asleep when they were told the funds were for a drug cartel , their attorneys argued .
The first of four trials in the Operation Casablanca case opened Tuesday in federal court , with some defense lawyers arguing their clients were coerced or entrapped into helping launder tens of millions of dollars for U.S. Customs agents posing as drug traffickers .
Stockbroker Fernando Barragan Reyes `` was asleep '' during the meeting in which he allegedly was told of the drug connection , said his lawyer , Manuel Araujo .
But prosecutor Duane Lyons told jurors that the six defendants `` went out of their way '' to cooperate with a government informant posing as a recruiter for the Cali cartel .
`` The goal ... was to get as much money as they could , deposit it into bank accounts , then get it to the traffickers in Colombia , '' he said .
Authorities seized $ 100 million from 14 banks and dozens of individuals during the three-year investigation .
The operation raised tension between the United States and Mexico when agents arrested 167 people , including top Mexican bankers and executives .
Mexico accused the United States of intruding on Mexican sovereignty by conducting a sting operation without its involvement .
Last month , two Mexican banks pleaded guilty to money laundering charges .
They agreed to pay $ 500,000 each in fines and forfeit a combined $ 13.6 million seized by authorities .
