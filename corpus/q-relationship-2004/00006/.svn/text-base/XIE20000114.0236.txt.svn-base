MOSCOW , January 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A top Russian military official said Friday that Russia would use nuclear weapons only in case of an aggression against itself or its allies under a new military doctrine expected to be approved next month .
Valery Manilov , the first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff who is a key drafter of the document , said the new doctrine `` clearly and distinctly '' viewed nuclear armaments as a deterrent .
The draft of the new doctrine will be submitted to the Russian Security Council , a top advisory body that includes chiefs of the so-called power ministries , for discussion in the next few days , Manilov said .
`` Russia has the right to use nuclear armaments exclusively in case of an aggression against itself and its allies and only when it is impossible to prevent by conventional means the liquidation of Russia as a subject of international relations , a sovereign entity in these relations , '' the Itar - Tass news agency quoted him as saying .
`` Only in that case Russia will have to use nuclear armaments , '' Manilov said .
`` Russia will never use nuclear armaments if there is no aggression against it . ''
Russia 's current military doctrine , which was approved on November 2 , 1993 , `` did not announce a possibility of using nuclear armaments so distinctly and firmly , '' Manilov said .
Instead , it just outlined conditions under which nuclear arms shall not be used , he said , adding that those conditions remain valid under the new doctrine .
Russia will not use nuclear arms against signatory states to the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty of July 1 , 1968 that does not have nuclear armaments , with the exception of two circumstances : -- An armed attack at Russia , its territory , Armed Forces and other troops or its allies by a country , which has a union agreement with a nuclear power ; -- Joint moves of such a country and a nuclear power to invade or to make an armed attack at Russia , its territory , Armed Forces and other troops or its allies
According to Tass , the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces is made up of three branches -- the Strategic Missile Troops , the Naval Strategic Forces and the Strategic Aviation Forces .
The Strategic Missile Troops , equipped with silo and mobile launchers , are a key component of the nuclear triad .
They have 756 launchers with 3,385 nuclear warheads .
The Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces are composed of 26 strategic nuclear-powered submarines , including six submarine carrying cruisers of the Typhoon class , seven of the Dolphin class and 13 of the Kamar -LRB- Squid -RRB- class .
If fully loaded , these powered submarines can carry up to 440 ballistic missiles with more than 2,000 warheads .
The Strategic Aviation has about 100 strategic assault aircraft of the Tu -160 , Tu -95MS and Tu -22MZ class , capable of carrying more than 800 nuclear warheads , Tass said .
