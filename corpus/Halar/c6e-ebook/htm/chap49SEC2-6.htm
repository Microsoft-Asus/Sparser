Each rod cell or cone cell has an outer segment with a stack of folded membranes, or discs, in which visual pigments are embedded (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.11a</span>, p. 1066).

This changes the conformation (shape) of the opsin protein. These light-induced changes in retinal plus opsin are referred to as "bleaching" of rhodopsin. In the dark, enzymes convert the retinal back to its original form, and it recombines with opsin to form rhodopsin (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.12</span>, p. 1066). Bright light keeps the rhodopsin bleached and rods become unresponsive; cones take over. When you walk from a bright environment into a dark place, such as walking into a movie theater in the afternoon, you are initially almost blind to faint light. There is not enough light to stimulate the cones, and it takes at least a few minutes for the bleached rods to become functional again.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig49-12','../fig/big/fig49-12.jpg','fig49-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig49-12.jpg" alt="fig49-12" name="myfig49-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 49-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Effect of light on retinal.</span> Retinal exists in two forms, isomers of each other.

This steady glutamate release in the dark excites some bipolar cells and inhibits others, depending on what post-synaptic receptor molecules they contain. When light triggers the rhodopsin signal-transduction pathway by altering retinal, an enzyme converts cGMP to GMP, which disengages from the Na<SUP>+</SUP> channels (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.13</span>). This closes the channels, decreasing the membrane’s permeability to Na<SUP>+</SUP> and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. In this case, the cell’s receptor potential is a <span class="Emphasis1">hyperpolarization</span> rather than a depolarization of the membrane. Hyperpolarization slows the rod cell’s release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and this causes either excitation or inhibition of postsynaptic bipolar cells, depending on the bipolar cell’s type of glutamate receptor (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.14</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig49-14','../fig/big/fig49-14.jpg','fig49-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig49-14.jpg" alt="fig49-14" name="myfig49-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 49-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The effect of light on synapses between rod cells and bipolar cells.

Color vision results from the presence of three subclasses of cones in the retina, each with its own type of opsin associated with retinal to form visual pigments collectively called <span class="Emphasis2">photopsins.</span> These photoreceptors are known as red cones, green cones, and blue cones, referring to the colors their kind of photopsin is best at absorbing. The absorption spectra for these pigments overlap, and the brain’s perception of intermediate hues depends on the differential stimulation of two or more types of cones. For example, when both red and green cones are stimulated, we may see yellow or orange, depending on which of these two populations of cones is most strongly stimulated. Color blindness, more common in males than females because it is generally inherited as a sex-linked trait (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 15.9</span>), is due to a deficiency or absence of one or more types of photopsin.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
