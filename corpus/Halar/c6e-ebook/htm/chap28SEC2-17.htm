There are also symbiotic species, including some parasites that cause human disease. We discuss these three groups together only for convenience. Little is known about their phylogeny, although it is clear that they represent several distinct eukaryotic lineages. Because of taxonomic uncertainties, we have not included these protists on the phylogenetic tree shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.8</span>.</p><p class="Header3">Rhizopoda (Amoebas)</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Rhizopods, more often called <span class="Emphasis2">amoebas,</span> are all unicellular and use pseudopodia to move and to feed. You may have observed their mode of motility in <span class="Emphasis1">Amoeba proteus</span> in the laboratory (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.1a</span>). Pseudopodia may bulge from virtually anywhere on the cell surface. When an amoeba moves, it extends a pseudopodium and anchors its tip, and then more cytoplasm streams into the pseudopodium (<span class="Emphasis1">rhizopoda</span> means "rootlike feet"). The cytoskeleton, consisting of microtubules and microfilaments, functions in amoeboid movement (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.27b</span>). Pseudopodial activity may appear chaotic, but in fact amoebas show directed movement as they creep toward a food source (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.26</span>). Some amoebas live inside a protein shell that they secrete. Pseudopodia extend outward through an opening in the shell, which in some species is coated with fine sand grains.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-26','../fig/big/fig28-26.jpg','fig28-26');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-26.jpg" alt="fig28-26" name="myfig28-26"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-26.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Use of pseudopodia for feeding.</span> In this series of images selected from a video, an <span class="Emphasis1">Amoeba</span> cell uses its pseudopodia to approach and then engulf its prey, a ciliate.

Each axopodium is reinforced by a bundle of microtubules covered by a thin layer of cytoplasm. Most actinopods are planktonic, and their projections place an extensive area of cellular surface in contact with the surrounding water, helping the organisms float and feed. Smaller protists and other microorganisms stick to the axopodia and are phagocytized by the thin layer of cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic streaming then carries the engulfed prey into the main part of the cell.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-27','../fig/big/fig28-27.jpg','fig28-27');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-27.jpg" alt="fig28-27" name="myfig28-27"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-27.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Actinopods.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Most <span class="Emphasis2">heliozoans</span> ("sun animals") live in fresh water.

The shells are generally multichambered and consist of organic material hardened with calcium carbonate. Strands of cytoplasm (pseudopodia) extend through the pores, functioning in swimming, shell formation, and feeding (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.28</span>).
