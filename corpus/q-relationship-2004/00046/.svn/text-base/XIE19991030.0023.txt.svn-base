MOSCOW , October 29 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told journalists Friday that he was unaware of any official appeal from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that a U.N. mission be sent to Chechnya .
`` We are working with a number of international organizations '' to provide aid to people temporarily displaced from Chechnya , Ivanov said .
`` If such aid is offered -LRB- by Annan -RRB- , we will welcome it . ''
Ivanov 's comment came after a statement by Annan 's spokesperson that a U.N. mission will be sent into Chechnya .
However , the statement was later revised in an apparent attempt to avoid interfering into Russia 's internal affairs .
It said a mission would be sent to Russia 's North Caucasus region where Chechen refugees fleeing the fighting are concentrated .
About 190,000 refugees have fled since fighting broke out a month ago Ivanov stressed that a permanent settlement in the breakaway republic `` must and will be political , '' but the conditions must be right for it , the Interfax news agency reported .
`` The elimination of terrorist gangs '' that have been sabotaging every kind of understanding between Moscow and Grozny for years is one of these conditions , Ivanov said .
Russian federal troops launched fierce attacks on Chechen rebels following two waves of armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of apartment bombings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities .
Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab , a Jordanian native known only by his last name , have been accused of masterminding the blasts .
The world community largely `` understands Russia 's actions aimed at neutralizing the source of terrorism in Chechnya and creating normal conditions for the people living in Chechnya and in the whole of the North Caucasus , '' Ivanov said .
In the meantime , the minister said , there were `` well-orchestrated '' attempts to misinterpret the picture of developments in the region .
Much misinformation is spread from Grozny itself , on the Internet for example , in particular about Russian missile and artillery attacks on residential areas in the Chechen capital , he said .
The Russian leaders have tasked the army with operating `` with a minimum of civilian casualties , '' Ivanov said .
In a related development , the Moscow office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that it `` has received the general consent of the Russian authorities '' for a U.N. mission to the North Caucasus to assess the humanitarian situation there , said Vera Soboleva , the office 's press secretary .
Soboleva said the mission does not intend to visit Chechnya .
`` From the first day of the talks between the U.N. and the Russian authorities , there has been no talk of a mission to Chechnya , in as much as what interests us is the condition of the people who have left the republic , '' Interfax quoted her as saying .
Soboleva said that understanding of the mission , which `` does not have any political goals , '' was reached following lengthy talks between the UNHCR office and the leadership of several Russian agencies , including the Emergency Situations Ministry , the Nationalities Ministry and the Federal Migration Service .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">She said that the mission , consisting of representatives of several specialized U.N. agencies such as the UNHCR and the UNICEF , plans to visit Ingushetia and Daghestan `` to pinpoint the needs of the displaced persons who arrived there from neighboring Chechnya .</ENAMEX> ''
On the basis of the mission 's report , a decision will be made as to the scale and forms of U.N. humanitarian aid , Soboleva said .
