-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Russian has managed to stabilize its level of arms sales despite strong international competition and declining demand in many parts of the world , according to a report Wednesday .
Yevgeny Ananyev , head of the Rosvooruzhenie state arms export company , told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper that annual exports were stable at around dlrs 2.5 billion to dlrs 3 billion .
The export authority had coordinated all sales and marketing efforts to ensure effective competition on world markets , he said .
Although well down from Soviet levels , Russia is one of the world 's top four arms exporters , supplying relatively inexpensive weapons with a reputation for reliability .
Ananyev said Russia was offering some of its most modern weapons for export because there was little demand for older models .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">He cited examples such as the S -300 PMU1 anti-missile system , Kilo class submarines , Su -27 and MiG -29 fighter jets and the Ka -50 Black Shark attack helicopter </ENAMEX>.
With the Russian economy in crisis , arms exports are among the country 's few steady sources of hard currency and one of the few sectors where Russian industry continues to operate effectively .
