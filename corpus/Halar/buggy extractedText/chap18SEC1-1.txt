THE GENETICS OF VIRUSES

 

 Researchers discovered viruses by studying a plant disease



 

 A virus is a genome enclosed in a protective coat



 

 Viruses can reproduce only within a host cell: an overview



 

 Phages reproduce using lytic or lysogenic cycles



 

 Animal viruses are diverse in their modes of infection and replication



 

 Plant viruses are serious agricultural pests



 

 Viroids and prions are infectious agents even simpler than viruses



 

 Viruses may have evolved from other mobile genetic elements
