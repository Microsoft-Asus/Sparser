-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Two Russian soldiers were killed Saturday in rebel Chechnya when their vehicle hit a booby-trap in the mountains where insurgents are concentrated , military officials said .
The incident near the village of Dzhani - Vedeno also wounded three other soldiers , and seven others were wounded when a remote-controlled mine went off under their vehicle near Bachi - Yurt , the news agency ITAR - Tass quoted the Russian military command as saying .
Also Saturday , officials said Russian forces destroyed two small rebel units moving along trails in a republic bordering Chechnya that has seen clashes between militants and federal troops recently .
The two units of four to six rebels each were destroyed in the last 24 hours in Ingushetia , the federal command told the Interfax news agency .

According to the report , the two groups were discovered in the same area where dozens of rebels clashed with Russian troops Wednesday and Thursday .

Meanwhile Saturday , a pro- Moscow Chechen official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that rebels shot at federal troops 19 times in the last 24 hours .
There were no reports of casualties .
The official also said Russian troops were conducting extensive sweeps of the city of Urus - Martan .
Traffic was blocked and troops were thoroughly checking all documents .
After a humiliating retreat from Chechnya at the end of a 1994-1996 war , Russian troops rolled back into the separatist region last September in a bid to end its self-proclaimed independence and crush the rebels , who had invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and who were also blamed for a series of apartment bombings that killed some 300 people .
Russian forces occupy about two-thirds of the republic and the rebels now are concentrated in the steep mountains of the southern third .
But some rebels have filtered back into the Russian -held areas , including the capital Grozny , and have tormented Russian forces with hit-and-run attacks and car bombs and have blown up military vehicles with mines .
A rebel field commander who uses the single name Abudar said Saturday that insurgents are recording their planting of mines on film and videotape because Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has offered sums of up to $ 5,000 for the destruction of tanks and armored personnel carriers .
Chechnya 's newly elected deputy to the Russian parliament , Aslanbek Aslakhanov , said that he was prepared to meet with Maskhadov , the newspaper Kommersant reported Saturday .
Russia has repeatedly ruled out negotiations with Maskhadov unless he gets the rebels to give up their weapons .
Many of the rebels fight under field commanders outside the control of Maskhadov .
Aslakhanov was elected in an Aug. 20 vote .
Moscow still has not made clear whether it will use him in efforts to end the conflict .
