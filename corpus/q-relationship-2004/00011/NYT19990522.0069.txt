WASHINGTON --
Reports from an investigation by a House committee last week seemed to leave little doubt : Beijing 's theft of secrets from American nuclear weapons laboratories led to spectacular gains by China in creating a modern thermonuclear arsenal .
The penetration went deeper and was more devastating than anyone had imagined .
Turf -conscious national security officials , called to account at acrimonious congressional hearings , have blamed one another , and one scientist has been fired .
But officials have not been able to explain exactly why no one has been arrested for crimes that enabled China to leap from 1950s technology to an atomic force built on the most advanced research of American laboratories .
After all , for years the FBI has , seemingly routinely , ferreted out spies , and the Justice Department has brought them to trial .
Just last week , in a much less important case , a former Australian military intelligence analyst , Jean Philippe Wispelaere , was arrested and charged with trying to sell more than 700 highly classified American defense documents to an undercover FBI agent who had posed as a spy .
But veterans of espionage investigations , including former and current intelligence and law enforcement officials , say that slam-dunk cases like Wispelaere 's are the exception .
They offered a variety of explanations for the government 's inability to proceed against the most significant figure to emerge in the nuclear secrets case , Wen Ho Lee , the scientist fired from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory .
In a long explanation of his activities , Lee has denied ever spying for Beijing .
Given the government 's faint trails of leads , some law-enforcement officials say they are not convinced of his guilt .
The federal espionage law , which dates back to World War I , is deceptively simple .
It requires that prosecutors prove that a defendant delivered , transmitted or attempted to communicate classified national security information to a foreign power .
A stream of post- Cold War spy cases , from Aldrich Ames , the mole at the CIA who spied for Russia , to Earl Edwin Pitts , who spied for Russia at the FBI , have created the impression that spy cases are no harder to crack than a sophisticated burglary ring .
But counterintelligence officials say that espionage cases have been among the most difficult because of the highly covert nature of the crime , said John L. Martin , a former chief of the Justice Department 's Internal Security Section who is a lawyer at OSO Group , a private investigative firm .
In a bank robbery , he said , money is missing ; in a homicide , there is a body ; in a kidnapping , someone disappears .
But espionage is a phantom act : Usually , nothing is missing , nothing is left behind , and the victims may not know that they were a target .
Luckily for prosecutors , even well-schooled spies make mistakes .
In the case of Ames , after eight years as a mole for Moscow , his profligate spending and maroon Jaguar in the CIA parking lot in Langley , Va. , aroused the suspicions of authorities .
When agents searched his house , they found in his bedroom closet a damning spy 's library of secret communications with the Russians .
The weapons case involved secrets of W -88 technology , developed by American scientists to miniaturize nuclear warheads .
The theft was not clearly understood in the United States until 1995 , years after the Chinese are believed to have acquired the information .
But by then the trail of the mole inside the weapons laboratory -- if there was one -- had grown cold , potential leads had dried up and records from the mid-1980s , when the theft probably occurred , were missing or incomplete .
Department of Energy officials did not begin to suspect Lee until 1995 , and the FBI 's investigation did n't begin until mid-1996 .
Officials did not even know the information had been pilfered until after W -88 technology was used by the Chinese in a 1992 test .
By the time the investigation of Lee got under way , officials have said , the case rested on evidence far too shaky to take to court : his access to the highly classified W -88 information , his travels to China and meetings with scientists there , and small but potentially revealing incidents , like the time he was hugged by a Chinese official in what seemed to be a congratulatory way .
For their part , Justice Department officials say the evidence was so dated and tenuous that in 1997 they twice refused the FBI 's request to seek authorization for a warrant that would have permitted agents to use wiretaps and other monitoring devices against Lee .
Agents posing as Chinese operatives even tried to lure him into spying , but had no success .
FBI officials complained that aides to Attorney General Janet Reno were wrong to deny their requests and failed to aggressively back them .
As a result they did not search his computer until earlier this year .
That 's when they found that he had transferred a huge cache of highly classified nuclear design codes into an unclassified computer .
But it is unclear what happened to the data .
If the government had evidence that the information went to a foreign power , Lee would probably be under arrest .
It is uncertain whether he violated laws against mishandling classified material .
Beyond the specifics of Lee case , American officials said they have had difficulty in thwarting Chinese intelligence efforts .
Beijing 's operations are far less structured than the spying activities of traditional adversaries .
The Chinese rely heavily on getting information from Chinese professionals and students in the United States who travel between the two countries .
In contrast , most American counterintelligence agents are trained in the spy-vs.-spy craft of the old Soviet KGB and East bloc intelligence agencies .
Instead of relying on case officers who recruit people to steal information , Chinese intelligence operations focus on scientist-to-scientist technical meetings in China .
