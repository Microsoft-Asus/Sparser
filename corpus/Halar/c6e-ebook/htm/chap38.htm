Indeed, in a Darwinian view of life, the fitness of an organism is measured only by its ability to replace itself with healthy, fertile offspring. Consider the century plant</span> (Agave) <span class="Emphasis1">in the photograph on this page. It lives for decades without flowering, and then one spring it grows a floral stalk as tall as a telephone pole. That season the plant produces seeds and then withers and dies, its food reserves, minerals, and water spent in the formation of its massive bloom. Although not all flowering plants are as completely consumed as the century plant in leaving offspring, most of their other functions--for example, photosynthesis and growth--can be interpreted, in the broadest Darwinian sense, as mechanisms contributing to propagation. Sexual reproduction, as in the case of oak and</span> Agave, <span class="Emphasis1">however, is not the sole means by which flowering plants reproduce: Many species can also reproduce asexually, creating offspring that are genetically identical to themselves</span>.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In Chapters 29 and 30, we approached plant reproduction from an evolutionary perspective, tracing the descent of angiosperms and other land plants from their aquatic ancestors, charophycean algae. In this chapter, we explore the reproductive biology of flowering plants (angiosperms) in much greater detail because they are the most important group of plants in most terrestrial ecosystems and in agriculture. In addition to examining both sexual and asexual reproduction of angiosperms, we will place plant biotechnology in the broader context of human intervention in the propagation and genetics of the angiosperm varieties we have been cultivating for millennia</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
