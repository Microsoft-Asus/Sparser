JOHANNESBURG , January 13 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Africa will not make decision on whether it would go ahead with the proposed 3-billion Rands -LRB- 638 million U.S. dollars -RRB- arms deal with Syria until late January , a top official said today .
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said the cabinet did conditionally agree to sell Syria South Africa -made tank firing control systems on December 4 , but a final decision would only be made by the end of this month .
The spokesman said Mbeki was investigating whether the arms sale would contradict the United States ' Counter - Terrorism Act , under which any country that provided lethal military equipment to `` terrorist countries '' would meet American sanctions .
Syria is on Washington 's list of `` states that sponsor terrorism '' .
Earlier reports said the arms deal between Pretoria and Damascus could lead to a conflict between the U.S. and South Africa .
In addition , Israel , bordering with Syria and a mortal enemy to the country , is also reported to have shown grave concern over Pretoria - Damascus talks about the purchase of the military equipment .
