<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday met with former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and pledged to carry out earlier promises to improve ties .
`` We have good relations and I 'm sure that ... the specific proposals we signed will be carried out , '' Yeltsin told reporters after the meeting in a reference to agreements he signed with Hashimoto during previous meetings .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Yeltsin and Hashimoto developed friendly relations during two informal summits , one in Russia last November and one in Japan in April .
The meetings were hailed as a breakthrough in relations strained by a territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands off the southern Japanese coast .</ENAMEX>
The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II , mainly because of a disagreement over control of the islands , claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the end of the war .
Yeltsin and Hashimoto did not `` concretely '' discuss the dispute over the Kurils , said Sergei Prikhodko , Yeltsin 's deputy chief of staff .
But they did discuss a plan to sign a broad bilateral treaty , and the two nations ' Foreign Ministries are cooperating on it , Prikhodko said , according to the Interfax news agency .
Akio Kawato , Minister Counsellor of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow , said that the two men had agreed that their countries should conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible , Interfax reported .
`` The view of Russia among the Japanese has changed dramatically recently , '' Hashimoto was quoted as saying by the ITAR - Tass news agency .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` We are happy that our friendly relations are developing so . ''
Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named special foreign policy advisor by his successor , Keizo Obuchi .</ENAMEX>
Obuchi , who served as foreign minister under Hashimoto , said last month that he wanted to sign a peace treaty and normalize relations with Russia by 2000 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANSWER">Hashimoto 's visit to Russia is paving the way for one by Obuchi scheduled for November , the first official trip to Moscow by a Japanese prime minister since 1973 .</ENAMEX>
