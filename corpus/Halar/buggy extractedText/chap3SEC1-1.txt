THE EFFECTS OF WATER'S POLARITY

 

 The polarity of water molecules results in hydrogen bonding



 

 Organisms depend on the cohesion of water molecules



 

 Water moderates temperatures on Earth



 

 Oceans and lakes don't freeze solid because ice floats



 

 Water is the solvent of life



Water is so common that it is easy to overlook the fact that it is an exceptional substance with many extraordinary qualities. Following the theme of emergent properties, we can trace water's unique behavior to the structure and interactions of its molecules.
