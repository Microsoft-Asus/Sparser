TRANSLOCATION OF PHLOEM SAP

 

 Phloem translocates its sap from sugar sources to sugar sinks



 

 Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms



Xylem sap flows in a direction that generally does not allow it to function in exporting sugar from leaves to other parts of the plant. A second vascular tissue, the phloem, transports the organic products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. This transport of food in the plant is called translocation. In angiosperms, the specialized cells of phloem that function in translocation are the sieve-tube members, which are arranged end to end to form long sieve tubes. Between the cells are sieve plates, porous cross-walls that allow the flow of sap along the sieve tube (see FIGURE 35.9).

Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that differs markedly in composition from xylem sap. By far the prevalent solute in phloem sap is sugar, primarily the disaccharide sucrose in most plant species. The sucrose concentration may be as high as 30%  by weight, giving the sap a syrupy thickness. Phloem sap may also contain minerals, amino acids, and hormones in transit from one part of the plant to another.
