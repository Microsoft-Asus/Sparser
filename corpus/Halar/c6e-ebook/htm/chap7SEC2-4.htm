These membranes also participate directly in the cell’s metabolism; many enzymes are built right into the membranes. Because the cell’s compartments provide different local environments that facilitate specific metabolic functions, incompatible processes can go on simultaneously inside the same cell.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Membranes of various kinds are fundamental to the organization of the cell. In general, biological membranes consist of a double layer of phospholipids and other lipids. Embedded in this lipid bilayer or attached to its surfaces are diverse proteins (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.6</span>). However, each type of membrane has a unique composition of lipids and proteins suited to that membrane’s specific functions. For example, enzymes embedded in the membranes of the organelles called mitochondria function in cellular respiration.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Before continuing with this chapter, examine the overviews of eukaryotic cells in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 7.7</span> and <span class="SmallCap">7.8</span> on these two pages. These figures introduce the various organelles and provide a map of the cell for the detailed tour upon which we will now embark. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 7.7</span> and <span class="SmallCap">7.8</span> also contrast animal and plant cells. As eukaryotic cells, they have much more in common than either has with any prokaryote. As you will see, however, there are important differences between plant and animal cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
