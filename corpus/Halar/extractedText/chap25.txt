Chapter 25: PHYLOGENY AND SYSTEMATICS

THE FOSSIL RECORD AND GEOLOGIC TIME

   Sedimentary rocks are the richest source of fossils

   Paleontologists use a variety of methods to date fossils

   The fossil record is a substantial, but incomplete, chronicle of evolutionary history

   Phylogeny has a biogeographic basis in continental drift

   The history of life is punctuated by mass extinctions



SYSTEMATICS: CONNECTING CLASSIFICATION TO PHYLOGENY

   Taxonomy employs a hierarchical system of classification

   Modern phylogenetic systematics is based on cladistic analysis

   Systematists can infer phylogeny from molecular data

   The principle of parsimony helps systematists reconstruct phylogeny

   Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses

   Molecular clocks may keep track of evolutionary time

   Modern systematics is flourishing with lively debate

Evolutionary biology is about both process and history. We have already studied natural selection and other processes that change populations (Chapter 23), and we have examined processes that can lead to the origin of new species (Chapter 24). But evolutionary biology also seeks to reconstruct the history of life on Earth.

This chapter describes how biologists trace phylogeny (from the Greek, phylon, tribe, and genesis, origin), the evolutionary history of a species or group of related species. Reconstructing phylogeny is part of the scope of systematics, the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Systematists also name and classify species. Our study of phylogeny and systematics begins with the fossils left by past life, such as the ancient fish in the photo above. We then examine the techniques through which systematists test and refine their hypotheses about phylogeny and classification. In the process, we see how molecular biology is changing systematics, as it is changing every field of biology.
