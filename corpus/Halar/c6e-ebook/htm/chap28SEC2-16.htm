Molecular systematics and cellular morphology leave little doubt that green algae and land plants are closely related. In fact, some systematists now advocate inclusion of green algae in an expanded kingdom, the <span class="Emphasis1">Viridiplantae</span> of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.8</span> (Latin <span class="Emphasis1">viridis</span>, green). The common ancestor of green algae and plants probably had chloroplasts derived from cyanobacteria by primary endosymbiosis. Among green algae, those called charophyceans are especially closely related to land plants, and we will discuss them along with the plants in the next chapter. Here our survey of green algae features the <span class="Emphasis1">chlorophytes</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">chloros</span>, green).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">More than 7,000 species of chlorophytes have been identified. Most live in fresh water, but there are also many marine species. Various species of unicellular chlorophytes live as plankton or inhabit damp soil or snow; some species live symbiotically within other eukaryotes, contributing portions of their photosynthetic products to the food supply of the hosts. Chlorophytes are among the algae that live symbiotically with fungi in the mutualistic collectives known as <span class="Emphasis2">lichens</span> (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.16</span>).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The simplest chlorophytes are biflagellated unicells such as <span class="Emphasis1">Chlamydomonas</span>, which resemble the gametes and zoospores of more complex chlorophytes. In addition to unicellular chlorophytes, there are colonial species, as well as many multicellular filamentous forms that contribute to the stringy masses known as pond scum. There are also multicellular chlorophytes, with bodies large and complex enough that marine species qualify as seaweeds along with the large brown algae and red algae.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Larger size and greater complexity have evolved by three different mechanisms: (1) the formation of colonies of individual cells, as seen in species of <span class="Emphasis1">Volvox</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.23a</span>); (2) the repeated division of nuclei with no cytoplasmic division, as seen in multinucleate filaments of <span class="Emphasis1">Caulerpa</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.23b</span>); and (3) the formation of true multicellular forms by cell division and cell differentiation, as in <span class="Emphasis1">Ulva</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.23c</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-23','../fig/big/fig28-23.jpg','fig28-23');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-23.jpg" alt="fig28-23" name="myfig28-23"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-23.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Colonial and multicellular chlorophytes.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Most green algae have complex life histories, with both sexual and asexual reproductive stages.

Note that this "plastid phylogeny" is not the same as a phylogeny of the organisms themselves. The heterokont algae, for example, did not evolve from red algae, but from some heterotrophic protist that engulfed a red alga. Note also that the dinoflagellates have plastids of diverse origins, including via <span class="Emphasis1">tertiary</span> endosymbiosis of an alga. But the host cells in the various endosymbiotic origins of dinoflagellate plastids were probably closely related as members of the alveolate group.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
