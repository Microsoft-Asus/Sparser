''
The fact is , the official said , that when he was jailed for stealing state secrets , Xi Yang explained in his own words that he had certain problems with headaches and indigestion , but a physical examinations indicated that he had no serious illness and that all vital signs were normal .
The official noted that during his two-year prison term , Xi Yang was in a good condition all the time , and nothing abnormal was found .
