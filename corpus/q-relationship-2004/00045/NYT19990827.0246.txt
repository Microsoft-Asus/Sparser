NEW YORK --
Here 's where we shot ` The Pope of Greenwich Village , ' '' said Rocco Musacchia , a man whose stocky build , dapper bearing and silk sport jacket elicited gapes from tourists at the sidewalk tables along Mulberry Street , in Little Italy .
`` Down the block , we shot ` Mickey Blue Eyes , ' '' he continued .
`` And right over there we shot ` Donnie Brasco . ' ''
Musacchia is a technical adviser for movie-location work .
His most recent assignment was `` Mickey Blue Eyes , '' a new romantic comedy in which Hugh Grant plays a diffident Englishman who falls for a mob princess and blunders his way into her family 's lives .
Musacchia was talking about New York City locations associated in both cinematic legend and real life with the Mafia , an organization that he does not concede exists .
Asked if a building on Mulberry Street that once housed Umberto 's Clam House was , in fact , the site of the real-life murder in 1972 of a reputed mobster by the name of Joseph -LRB- Crazy Joe -RRB- Gallo , Musacchia ignored the question .
Musacchia walks a thin line , in his shiny tasseled loafers , between Hollywood 's fascination with the Mafia and the organized-crime families whose history plays big at the multiplex as both farce and fact , and sometimes something in between .
On one hand , Musacchia , who is 60 , is proud to be known as a man with friends all over New York , New Jersey and Connecticut who can help him open doors and get things done .
On the other hand , he does not want anyone to get the wrong impression .
After all , this is 1999 .
The Ravenite Social Club , once the lair of John Gotti , is now a boutique selling home furnishings .
Art galleries have infiltrated the storefront social clubs and Italian restaurants on Mulberry Street .
In publicizing `` Mickey Blue Eyes , '' Grant and Elizabeth Hurley , the film 's executive producer , have suggested that their research into the New York underworld was assisted by a man who is what they used to call connected .
In the current issue of Jane magazine , Ms. Hurley , who said she was `` obsessed '' with the Mafia , lavishes praise on Musacchia , whom she refers to as the link between the likes of Al Pacino , Johnny Depp and Barry Levinson and the kind of men who could be on FBI surveillance lists .
On CNN last week , Grant said that Musacchia `` introduced us to another guy called Jimmy Seven Heads , who then introduced us to another guy called Tony Mussolini and , one by one , we got deeper and deeper into that world . ''
Speaking to the Cox News Service , Grant observed that Musacchia 's presence seemed to help head off location problems : `` Anywhere we wanted to shoot , we could shoot , '' Grant said .
`` We had no teamsters problems whatsoever . ''
Grant was undoubtedly giving Musacchia undue credit on this score .
Julianne Cho , a spokeswoman for the Mayor 's Office of Film , Theater and Broadcasting , which oversees location shooting in New York City , said : `` It 's ludicrous !
You do not have to deal with the Mafia to shoot a film in New York . ''
Musacchia is coy about his ability to provide entree to the New York underworld , attributing his success to a combination of hard work , street smarts , exhaustive networking and experience gained from location work in more than a dozen movies .
`` Mysterious connections , mysterious connections , '' he said with a laugh .
`` The fact is , everything is legitimate today . ''
In a 1987 federal investigation into mob influence in the record distribution business , Musacchia , who has also worked in the music business , was identified in an FBI affidavit as the partner of a ranking member of the Genovese crime family .
He was not charged .
`` They gave me immunity , '' he said .
`` I took the Fifth and that was it . ''
He denied that he was ever a member of any organized crime family .
The director John Huston , `` came to my rescue in the film industry , '' said Musacchia , who was hired as an adviser on Huston 's `` Prizzi 's Honor , '' despite the bad publicity generated by the FBI affidavit .
In the back room of In Bocca al Lupo , Musacchia sipped his mineral water .
This Mulberry Street bistro , which everybody calls Cha Cha 's , after its owner , John -LRB- Cha Cha -RRB- Ciarcia , is a haunt not of mobsters but the actors who play them .
The walls are lined with photos of the mustachioed proprietor posing with Marlon Brando , Danny DeVito and Danny Aiello , often surrounded by neighborhood characters who have played bit parts in various mob movies .
One of Musacchia 's specialities is finding such characters .
In his chatty personal notes on the front and back pages of the restaurant 's menu , Ciarcia says that he played the role of Marty No Neck in a 1994 feature called `` Me and the Mob . ''
Musacchia , who has had small roles in a half-dozen movies , including `` Mickey Blue Eyes , '' also appears in some of the photos .
He said he attributed Hollywood 's fascination with such movies to the family values that underlie Mafia legends .
Not everyone shares his view .
`` There 's nothing good , noble or funny about mob killers , '' said Stephen Fox , the author of `` Blood and Power : Organized Crime in 20th- Century America '' -LRB- Morrow , 1989 -RRB- .
Fox added that he was appalled by `` the ludicrous sociology '' of mob comedies like `` Analyze This , '' in which Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal play a violent mob boss and his psychiatrist .
In Musacchia 's own family , family values include location scouting .
He says all he knows of the Mafia is what he sees in the movies , which have been his life since he first helped an uncle who was doing location work in the 1960s for a Sophia Loren movie being shot on Mulberry Street .
Following in his uncle 's footsteps , he has become part of a network of would-be wise guys , celebrities , prosecutors and crime reporters who have built careers around the Mafia and who meet at Italian - American hangouts like Rao 's in East Harlem and form a kind of pseudo-commission ruling on the mob 's narrative mythology .
`` There 's actors that want to be wise guys and wise guys that want to be actors , '' Musacchia said .
He said one group of actors who appear frequently in mob films refer to themselves jokingly as the Gangsters Actors Guild .
`` Back when I was working with Marlon Brando in ` The Freshman , ' '' John Gotti happened to be at a restaurant across the street , '' Musacchia said , referring to a 1990 comedy in which Brando parodied his `` Godfather '' role .
`` Brando was like a kid : ` Oh , I got to go meet Gotti ! '
So I introduced them . ''
But who kissed whose ring ?
