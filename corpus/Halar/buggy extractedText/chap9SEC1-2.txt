THE PROCESS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION

 

 Respiration involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport: an overview



 

 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate: a closer look



 

 The Krebs cycle completes the energy-yieldingoxidation of organic molecules: a closer look



 

 The inner mitochondrial membrane couples electron transport to ATP synthesis: a closer look



 

 Cellular respiration generates many ATP molecules for each sugar molecule it oxidizes: a review



Now that we have covered the basic redox mechanisms of respiration, let's look at the entire process.
