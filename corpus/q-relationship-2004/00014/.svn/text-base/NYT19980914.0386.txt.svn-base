Women taking the current formulations of low-estrogen , oral contraceptives do not face increased risks of heart attack , according to a report in the Houston -based journal Circulation .
`` We are saying that if you are not at high risk for heart attack -- you do n't smoke , have a normal blood pressure , are not obese -- then oral contraceptives are OK for you to use , '' said Dr. Stephen Sidney , assistant director for clinical research at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland .
The researchers also found no differences between women taking pills containing either of the two forms of the hormone called progestin , commonly used in current oral contraceptives .
The study analyzed the results of studies involving 271 women between the age of 18 and 44 who had heart attacks , and 993 similar women who had not suffered a heart attack .
The women were drawn from groups at Kaiser Permanente and the University of Washington at Seattle .
After statistically compensating for heart attack risk factors , the researchers found that women who took the birth control pills were no more likely to have heart attacks than those who had stopped taking the pills or had never taken it .
Nearly 68 percent of the women who had heart attacks were smokers .
Only 22 percent of women who did not have a heart attack were smokers .
The mean body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- -- a measure of a person 's percent of body fat and an indication of obesity -- of the women who had heart attacks was above 30 , compared with 25.5 in the women who did not have heart attacks .
The National Center for Health Statistics defines overweight as a BMI of 25-29 , and obesity as 30 or greater .
While the risks associated with stroke and birth control pill have received the most attention , `` I think historically all cardiovascular disease has been of some interest in the field of oral contraceptives , '' Sydney said .
Earlier studies had shown that such pills did increase the risk of stroke , deeply seated blood clots and heart attacks , he said .
But those studies had involved oral contraceptives that contained much higher concentrations of estrogen .
Sydney said he thinks the difference in this study is the pill itself .
Newer forms of birth control pills have much lower concentrations of estrogen .
However , he said , the study does not prove that the lower dose pills are less likely to cause heart attacks .
The caveat that Sydney stressed is the possibility of risk factors .
Smoking , high blood pressure and obesity raise a person 's risk of heart disease , and those people probably should not use oral contraceptives , he said .
One important point to remember , he said , is the rarity of heart attacks in young women who are under age 45 .
`` When they happen , they are explained by the traditional risk factors for heart disease , '' he said .
