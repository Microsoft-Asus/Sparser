A Chinese campaigner for war reparations from Japan has been fired from his government job because of his activism , a human rights group reported Tuesday .
Tong Zeng was fired last week from his job as a researcher on aging at an institute under the Civil Affairs Ministry , the Hong Kong -based Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said in a statement .
Tong , 42 , had been active in recent years in pressing the Japanese government to pay reparations to victims of wartime atrocities and criticizing its control of a group of East China Sea islands that China claims .
Both issues are delicate ones for China .
While not wanting to harm its trade and diplomatic relations with Japan , Beijing fears public criticism for failing to stand up to Tokyo , which many Chinese still regard as untrustworthy .
In recent years , police have tried to silence Tong by detaining him for short periods of time or forcing him to leave Beijing during visits by foreign dignitaries .
Although the Chinese government relinquished claims to compensation from Japan when diplomatic relations were restored in 1972 , it has not officially prohibited individuals from seeking redress .
An official at the China Research Center on Aging who refused to give her name confirmed Tong had been fired .
But she said his inattentiveness to his work and a failed performance review were the reasons for his dismissal .
Calls to Tong 's home were not answered .
The Hong Kong rights group said Tong used his spare time to campaign for Japanese reparations , but his employer had warned him he would be fired unless he gave up pushing claims against Tokyo .
Before a visit by then Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto last year , Tong organized a petition demanding that the Japanese leader apologize for atrocities in World War II and curb what the petitioners called resurgent militarism in Japan .
It also called on Japan to provide compensation for wartime losses and give up claims to the contested East China Sea islands -- called the Diaoyus by Chinese and the Senkakus in Japan .
China claims that 35 million of its people were killed during Japan 's 1931-45 occupation of much of China .
