									<a name="para103"></a><p class="BlockText">In general, locomotion on land requires more energy than locomotion in water. By integrating what you have learned throughout these chapters on animal functions, discuss some of the evolutionary adaptations of mammals that support the high energy requirements for moving on land.</p>

									<a name="para105"></a><p class="BlockText">Although skeletal muscles generally fatigue fairly rapidly, clam shell muscles have a unique protein called paramyosin that allows them to sustain contraction for up to a month. From your knowledge of the cellular mechanism of contraction, propose a hypothesis to explain how paramyosin might work. How would you test your hypothesis experimentally?</p>

									<a name="para107"></a><p class="BlockText">You may know an older person who has broken a bone (often a hip) partly because of osteoporosis, a loss of bone density that affects many women after menopause. Researchers think that prevention is the best way to avoid osteoporosis. They recommend exercise and maximum calcium intake during the teenage years and the twenties. Is it realistic to expect young people to view themselves as future senior citizens? How would you recommend that they be encouraged to develop good health habits that might not pay off for 40 or 50 years?</p>
