COLOMBO , Sri Lanka --
Though it is on the defensive militarily , the Sri Lankan government on Monday night firmly rejected a separatist Tamil group 's offer of a cease-fire in exchange for the government 's promise to withdraw tens of thousands of its troops from the northern Jaffna peninsula .
President Chandrika Kumaratunga , who survived an assassination attempt by a separatist suicide bomber , said in a nationally televised address Monday evening that the government would stay and fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .
The rebel group is notorious for its suicide attacks and has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States .
The eye patch that had covered Kumaratunga 's eye , injured in the December assassination attempt , was gone Monday when she calmly declared , `` We shall leave no room for the LTTE to again fasten their fascist grip on half a million Tamil people in Jaffna . ''
But Kumartunga 's decision was a risky one .
The Tigers have been on a stunningly successful military march to reclaim Jaffna , the cultural capital of the Hindu Tamil -dominated north in this majority Buddhist Sinhalese nation .
For the first time in the 18-year civil war -- which has claimed more than 60,000 lives in a nation with a population no larger than that of New York state -- the rebels control Elephant Pass , which the leader of the political opposition has called the doorway to the fortress of Jaffna .
Since 1995 the government has controlled Jaffna , but for five years before that the Tigers ran what was essentially a separate state there .
Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land connecting the mainland to the peninsula and is the site of the most heavily fortified military base in the country .
On April 22 , with military moves like those of a powerful conventional army , the rebels took the pass .
Analysts say that with the Tigers , who seek a separate Tamil homeland , in control of the pass , it will be very difficult for the government to defend Jaffna .
Last week the government banned political rallies and union strikes and tightened a vise of press censorship in what it said was an effort to protect national security but that the opposition said was an attempt to hide its own failings .
The outlawed Tigers said Monday in a statement issued from their London office that they are willing to observe a cease-fire once the government surrenders Jaffna , which the rebels said could open the way to peace talks .
The rebels said the government 's rejection of the offer could lead to `` disastrous consequences of heavy military casualties . ''
Fears of a large force of demoralized government troops trapped on the Jaffna peninsula and hostage to the Tigers have led some human rights leaders and political officials to hope that India , the region 's great power , would intervene .
India 's prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee , met Monday with the leaders of 20 political parties to discuss the military conflict in Sri Lanka .
India has a much larger Tamil population than Sri Lanka in its politically potent southern state of Tamil Nadu .
And India supported Sri Lankan Tamil militants , including the Tigers , in the 1980s .
But India worries about stirring nationalist feeling among its own Tamil citizenry .
And both Sri Lanka and India have an interest in holding together their ethnically and religiously diverse nations .
So on Monday , India ruled out military intervention , though it was not clear if it would refuse to assist in evacuating troops .
In the late 1980s , India lost more than 1,000 of its own troops on a lengthy peacekeeping mission in Sri Lanka .
The parliamentary affairs minister , Pramod Mahajan , said after the meeting Monday that India would only consider mediating between the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government if both sides wanted Indian help .
The role of mediator had fallen earlier this year to Norway , which was one of the countries the Tigers had deemed an acceptable intermediary .
The leader of the political opposition in Sri Lanka , Ranil Wickremesinghe , said in an interview Monday night that he believes Norway and India might work together to try to broker a deal .
The bitter , personal feuding between Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe , who heads the United National Party , has been an important element in a failed attempt to get the government 's peace plan through Parliament .
The opposition party had opposed the government 's attempt to change the constitution to give the Tamils greater autonomy in the north .
Lately , Kumartunga and Wickremesinghe have had their own peace talks , but any agreement they reach may be overtaken by military developments that -- up to now -- are tilting in favor of the Tigers .
