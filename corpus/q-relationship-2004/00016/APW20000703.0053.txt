JERUSALEM
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday he does n't want to hurt ties with the United States over Israel 's planned sale of a spy plane to China -- a comment that came amid growing indications the deal could be called off .
Israel is looking to solve the problem without creating an `` an obstacle in our relations with the United States , '' Barak said .
He did not mention damage to relations with China if the deal is canceled .
China is a major purchaser of Israeli arms .
Israel 's planned sale of the plane , called PHALCON , has become a stumbling block between Israel and the United States in recent months .
The United States insists that Israel scrap the sale , pointing to tensions between China and Taiwan and expressing concern that China could use the plane to track American planes if hostilities erupt .
In the U.S. Congress , representatives from both parties have threatened to cut American aid to Israel if the deal goes through .
Israel receives $ 1.9 billion in annual defense aid from the United States .
But the Israelis say the U.S. government is trying to undermine Israeli competition for arms markets in Asia .
They warn that if they have to cancel a signed contract with China , it would harm their future credibility in arms deals .
With the Israeli - Palestinian peace treaty talks in a critical phase , Barak depends on the Clinton administration 's good will .
The Israeli leader has been urging President Clinton to convene a trilateral summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in which the leaders would try to finalize a peace accord .
If such an agreement is reached , Israel would ask for billions of dollars in additional U.S. aid -- something Congress would be unlikely to approve as long as the disagreement over the spy plane has not been resolved .
Israeli newspapers and others have begun raising the possibility of American compensation to Israel for calling off the spy plane deal .
Last week , an Israeli Cabinet minister close to Barak said it was in Israel 's interest to cancel the deal .
And during last week 's one-day visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , both Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy referred to the plane deal and said Israel would take no steps that would harm American interests .
The PHALCON deal includes a Chinese option to buy up to four more of the spy planes , which are built on a Russian chassis with Israeli technology .
