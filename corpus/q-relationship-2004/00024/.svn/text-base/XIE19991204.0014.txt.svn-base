ISLAMABAD , December 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Pakistan and India , the two South Asian rival neighbors having a history of tension and wars , should be keenly interested in dialogue for maintaining peace and stability to ameliorate the lot of their impoverished peoples .
Following the exchange of usual hard-hitting statements in the wake of last month 's military takeover in Islamabad , the two governments have signaled their willingness to resume their stalled talks aimed at resolving their outstanding issues which have bedeviled their relations during the more than 50 years of their simultaneous independence .
However , analysts here noted that the two countries are obviously divergent in their positions on the proposed dialogue which has come to a deadlock since early this year .
After he assumed the office last month , Pakistan 's Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf has on several occasions offered `` unconditional , meaningful and result-oriented dialogue '' with India , particularly on the main issue of Jammu and Kashmir .
Musharraf , who is concurrently chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and the army chief , also ordered the withdrawal of additional Pakistani troops deployed along the international borders in the wake of the Kargil crisis in disputed Kashmir area in August which had brought the two nations to the verge of war .
The recent agreement between Pakistani and Indian border forces not to alter the status of working boundary and to put an immediate stop to firing across the border is a positive development in the relations between the two estranged neighbors .
However , the Indian side has a different opinion on resuming the stalled dialogue .
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said Pakistan must first take steps to restore confidence before the two sides can start talking again .
Referring to the political change since the military coup on October 12 , Vajpayee said , `` the ground reality is hardly conducive to resumption of meaningful dialogue .
Let Pakistan first take steps to restore confidence and create the right atmosphere for a meaningful dialogue . ''
He said if Pakistan was interested in resuming peace talks , it should `` first follow the Simla Accord and the Lahore Declaration in true letter and spirit . ''
`` We do not believe in entering into new agreements and simply ignoring the previous ones , '' said Vajpayee .
The Pakistani side , however , is rather critical of the Indian position which `` confines only to some provisions of its liking in the bilateral agreements '' for resumption of talks .
Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said Pakistan will honor and implement its obligations under the international agreements , treaties and resolutions of the U.N. Security Council .
It cannot agree to conditions for dialogue based on `` arbitrarily selected provisions of some agreements or their unilateral interpretations . ''
Analysts here are of the view that Pakistan and India will have no other option but to talk in a bid to improve their strained bilateral relations and to solve all of their outstanding issues .
One would wonder that when the armies of both countries stare eyeball-to-eyeball , when the main Jammu -and- Kashmir dispute remains unresolved , and especially when the two are now nuclear armed , what else can be if these are not sufficiently compelling reasons for a sincere attempt at dialogue .
There is virtually no argument in the international community after the respective nuclear detonation by India and Pakistan in May last year that the main issue affecting the bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations is Kashmir .
Since their inception in 1947 , Pakistan and India have fought three wars , two of which directly on Kashmir , for which the two peoples have paid heavy prices .
India accuses Pakistan of fomenting Muslim insurgency in Indian -held Kashmir .
However , Pakistan denies the charge and maintains it provides `` only moral , diplomatic and political support to Kashmiri freedom fighters . ''
Irshad Ahmed Haqqani , former information minister and commentator , said Pakistan has also been stressing for the creation of a favorable atmosphere for the dialogue .
However , he said `` by this we meant that India should stop human rights violation in Kashmir and withdraw its troops from there . ''
`` Neither country can make a straight offer or even come up with a clear statement regarding talks without attacking conditions and qualifications , '' Dawn , a major English daily , said recently in an editorial .
It further said that `` an effort should be made to clear not so much the concrete barriers as the mental cobwebs to that the two countries , their relations fraught and frozen during the whole course of this year , can begin anew the process of talking to each other . ''
Analysts said the two countries must have an inherent capacity to move forward instead of remaining perpetual hostage to the mental blockages of the past .
However , it is believed that any such effort must be grounded in realism instead of an enthusiastic but vague desire for peace .
This is important because , without the will to tackle real problems , tensions will remain high and peace and stability in the region will be an elusive prospect .
