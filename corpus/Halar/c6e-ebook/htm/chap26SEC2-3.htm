We’ll see examples of such nonoxygenic photosynthesis among modern prokaryotes in Chapter 27. The only photosynthetic prokaryotes that generate O<SUB>2</SUB> are called cyanobacteria. Plentiful and diverse today, they probably evolved over 2.7 billion years ago.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Most atmospheric oxygen is of biological origin, from the water-splitting step of photosynthesis. When this oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved, the free O<SUB>2</SUB> from the cyanobacteria probably dissolved in the surrounding water until the seas and lakes became saturated with the oxygen. Additional O<SUB>2</SUB> would then react with dissolved iron and precipitate as iron oxide. These marine sediments were the source of banded iron formations, red layers of rock rich in the iron oxide that is a valuable source of iron ore today (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.5</span>). Once all the dissolved iron had precipitated, additional O<SUB>2</SUB> finally began to "gas out" of the seas and lakes to accumulate in the atmosphere. This change left its mark in the rusting of terrestrial rocks rich in iron that began oxidizing about 2.7 billion years ago. This chronology implies that cyanobacteria may have originated as early as 3.5 billion years ago, when the microbial mats that left stromatolites began forming.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig26-5','../fig/big/fig26-5.jpg','fig26-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig26-5.jpg" alt="fig26-5" name="myfig26-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 26-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Banded iron formations are evidence of the vintage of oxygenic photosynthesis.</span> These bands of iron oxide at Jasper Knob in Michigan are about 2 billion years old.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The accumulation of atmospheric O<SUB>2</SUB> was gradual from about 2.7 to 2.2 billion years ago, but then shot up relatively rapidly to more than 10%  of its present level. This oxygen revolution had an enormous impact on life. The "corrosive" O<SUB>2</SUB>, which attacks chemical bonds, doomed many prokaryotic groups. Some species survived in habitats that remained anaerobic, where we find their descendants still living today as obligate anaerobes (see p. 533). Among other survivors, a diversity of adaptations to the changing atmosphere evolved, including cellular respiration, which uses oxygen to help harvest energy stored in organic molecules.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The early rise in atmospheric O<SUB>2</SUB> was associated with the photosynthesis of early cyanobacteria.
