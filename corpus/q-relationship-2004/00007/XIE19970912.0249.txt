BEIJING , September 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin reiterated here today that China is a staunch force for safeguarding world peace and regional stability and its development poses no threat to any other country .
In his report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China which opened here today , Jiang Zemin stressed that China needs a long-term peaceful international environment , and above all , good relations with the surrounding countries for carrying out the socialist modernization program .
`` China will never seek hegemony even when it becomes developed in future , '' he stressed , adding that the Chinese people , for a long time subjected to aggression , oppression and humiliation by foreign powers , will never inflict these sufferings upon others .
He said that the present international situation as a whole is becoming more relaxed and peace and development are the main themes of the present era .
`` The trend toward multipolarity has further developed globally or regionally in the political , economic and other fields .
World forces are experiencing a new split and realignment , '' he noted , adding that the development of the trend toward multipolarity contributes to world peace , stability and prosperity .
For a fairly long period of time to come , it will be possible to avert a new world war and secure a favorable , peaceful international environment and maintain good relations with the surrounding countries , Jiang Zemin said .
However , the cold war mentality still exists , and hegemonism and power politics continue to be the main source of threat to world peace and stability , he pointed out .
`` The unjust and irrational old international economic order is still infringing upon the interests of developing countries , and the gap in wealth is widening .
It is still serious that human rights and other issues are used to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries .
Local conflicts due to ethnic , religious and territorial factors crop up from time to time .
The world is not yet tranquil . ''
It is necessary to adhere to the ideas of Deng Xiaoping about diplomatic work and firmly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace , Jiang said .
In international affairs , he noted , `` we should determine our position and policies by proceeding from the fundamental interests of the people of China and other countries and judging each case on its own merits .
We shall not yield to any outside pressure or enter into alliance with any big power or group of countries , nor shall we establish any military bloc , join in the arms race or seek military expansion . ''
