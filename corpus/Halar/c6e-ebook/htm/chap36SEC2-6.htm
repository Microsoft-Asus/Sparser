For example, what mechanisms transport water and minerals absorbed by a root from the outer cells to the inner cells of the root? Such short-distance transport is sometimes called lateral transport because its usual direction is along the radial axis of plant organs, rather than up and down along the length of the plant.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Three routes are available for lateral transport (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 36.6b</span>). By the first route, substances move out of one cell, across the cell wall, and into the neighboring cell, which may then pass the substances along to the next cell in the pathway by the same mechanism. This transmembrane route requires repeated crossings of plasma membranes, as the solutes exit one cell and enter the next.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The second route, via the symplast, the continuum of cytosol within a plant tissue, requires only one crossing of a plasma membrane. After entering one cell, solutes and water can then move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The third route for lateral transport within a plant tissue or organ is along the apoplast, the extracellular pathway consisting of cell walls and extracellular spaces. Before ever entering a cell, water and solutes can move from one location to another within a root or other organ along the byways provided by the continuum of cell walls.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
