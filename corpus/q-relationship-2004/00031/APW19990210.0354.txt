AMMAN , Jordan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The man who spent his life preparing to sit on the Hashemite throne was absent when the new monarch began greeting his subjects .
The death of King Hussein did more than shake up his nation .
It rattled the royal family to the core .
At the center of the storm is Hussein 's brother , 51-year -old Prince Hassan , who had been groomed as the royal heir for more than three decades .
Then a quarrel over succession left Hassan out in the cold last month when the ailing Hussein picked his son , Abdullah , to take the throne after his death .
After Hussein died Sunday and King Abdullah took power , the family publicly united for the funeral .
But Hassan 's decision to stay away from the greeting ceremony Tuesday could show cracks emerging and has made some people nervous after 46 years of steadfast rule under Hussein .
`` There is no room for any family rift because that will imperil national security and disturb the personal interests of the royal family , '' said former Cabinet minister Jamal Shaer .
There is little chance of serious challenges since the military is loyal to Abdullah , 37 , a career officer .
Yet Jordanians grow quickly uneasy over any royal discord in their tiny desert kingdom with an unmatched record of stability in the volatile Middle East .
`` The monarchy here allows for one head of state , not two , '' said political analyst Labib Kamhawi .
`` Hassan 's options are simple and clear : Either to stay in the country quietly or leave . ''
Hassan 's world came crashing down in the span of a few hours on Jan. 26 .
Hussein sent Hassan an angry letter of dismissal , accusing him of power-grabbing and fabricating `` lies and gossip '' about his family .
Palace sources said Hussein was referring to false allegations that his wife , Queen Noor , had an out-of-wedlock child before marriage and that she was maneuvering to have her son , Hamzeh , replace Hassan as the crown prince -- as he ultimately did .
At Hussein 's funeral Monday , Hassan and his 19-year -old son Rashid were virtually the only immediate members of the family who did not wear the traditional mourning headdress .
Hassan stood silently , staring at the ceiling of the ornate throne chamber in Raghdan Palace , as other members of the family tearfully shook hands with heads of state and dignitaries paying respects .
Hassan 's Pakistani -born wife , Princess Sarvath , and their three daughters were not present at the funeral .
Hassan 's daughters did not visit their uncle the king in his sickbed at an Amman hospital in his last days , when all the other royal family members were in constant attendance .
A palace source , speaking on customary condition of anonymity , said it has been a `` most strenuous time '' for Hassan because of the loss of his brother and `` the swift changes that ensued . ''
Hassan has been cloistered in the library of his modest Amman home reading books until late at night , the source added .
Recently , rumors mounted that Hassan will take himself into exile in London like his uncle , Prince Nayef bin Abdullah , who fled to Spain one year after Hussein ascended to the throne , depriving him of the crown .
But Hassan 's aides say there is `` nothing in cards now '' for any stay abroad .
In an emotional letter to Abdullah read Tuesday night on Jordan Television , Hassan pledged his support for the king and his crown prince .
`` I vow in front of God , the nation , and our great people to support you and be a brother to your majesty and your crown prince , '' Hassan wrote .
There have been suggestions that Abdullah -- who was sworn in as king only three hours after Hussein 's death -- would appoint Hassan as a chief adviser to primarily oversee economic development in Jordan .
But it was not immediately clear if Hassan would accept a post that would require working under his nephew , 18-year -old Prince Hamzeh .
As crown prince , Hamzeh is now No. 2 under King Abdullah , responsible for the country 's affairs when Abdullah is away .
Hamzeh is Hussein 's son from his fourth wife , American -born Lisa Halaby , who adopted the name of Noor al- Hussein -- Arabic for `` Light of Hussein '' -- after converting to Islam before she married the king in 1978 .
Noor had ruffled the feathers of Hassan 's family for showcasing Hamzeh and grooming him for the throne in recent years , the royal palace sources said .
Noor will keep her title as queen even if King Abdullah decides to bestow the title on his wife , Princess Rania , as well .
Jordan can have more than one queen .
Another new factor is Princess Muna -- the former Toni Gardiner -- Hussein 's British -born second wife and the mother of King Abdullah .
She went to live in Britain following her divorce from the king , but was in Jordan during Hussein 's final illness , visiting him frequently at the hospital with other members of the royal family .
Muna had been little seen publicly in Amman for some years , but on Tuesday she re-emerged into view , joining Queen Noor and other royal relatives in receiving condolences from Jordanian women .
In addition to Abdullah , she had a second son and twin daughters with Hussein .
