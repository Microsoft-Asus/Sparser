This document does not replace the taskdescription on the <ahref="http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/task15/description.shtml">SemEval</a>and <a href="http://timeml.org/tempeval/">TempEval</a> websites, butcomplements it.<h3>Data Description</h3>The TempEval annotation language is a simplified versionof <a href="http://timeml.org/">TimeML</a>.  TheTimeML <a href="docs/timeml_1.2.1.html">specifications</a>,<a href="docs/annguide_1.2.1.pdf">annotation guidelines</a> and<a href="docs/timeml_1.2.1.dtd" type="text/plain">document typedefinition</a> (all for TimeML version 1.2.1) are included here foreasy reference. For TempEval, we use the following five tags:<dl><dt>&lt;TempEval&gt;<dd>The document root.</dl><dl><dt>&lt;s&gt;<dd>The sentence tag. All sentence tags in the TempEval data areautomatically created using the Alembic Natural Language processingtools. A sentence tag can contain TIMEX3 tags andEVENT tags, but no TLINK tags.</dl><dl><dt>&lt;TIMEX3&gt;<dd>Tags the time expressions in the text. It is identical to theTIMEX3 tag in TimeML. See theTimeML <a href="docs/timeml_1.2.1.html">specifications</a>and <a href="docs/annguide_1.2.1.pdf">guidelines</a> for furtherdetails on this tag and its attributes. Each document has one specialTIMEX3 tag, the Document Creation Time, which is interpreted as aninterval that spans the whole day.</dl><dl><dt>&lt;EVENT&gt;<dd>Tags the events in the text. The TempEval EVENT merges theinformation on two TimeML tags: EVENT and MAKEINSTANCE. TimeML usedthese two tags to refer to two instances of an event in sentences like"He taught on Wednesday and Friday". This complication was notnecessary for the TempEval data. Both tags and their attributes aredescribed in theTimeML <a href="docs/timeml_1.2.1.html">specifications</a>and <a href="docs/annguide_1.2.1.pdf">guidelines</a>. For TempEvaltask C, one extra attribute is added: <tt>mainevent</tt>, withpossible values <tt>YES</tt> and <tt>NO</tt>.</dl><dl><dt>&lt;TLINK&gt;<dd>A simplified version of the TimeML TLINK tag. The relationtypes for the TimeML version form a fine-grained set based on JamesAllen's interval logic (James Allen, "Maintaining Knowledge aboutTemporal Intervals." Communications of the ACM 26, 11, 832-843,November 1983). For TempEval, we only use three relations as well asthree disjunctions over those three: BEFORE, OVERLAP, AFTER,BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP, OVERLAP-OR-AFTER, and VAGUE. Here, OVERLAP refersto two events (or an event and a time interval) that have a non-emptyoverlap. VAGUE is used for those cases where no particular relationcan be established.</dl>The test data contain all event and timex information, including, fortask C, markers to indicate main events for each sentence. Inaddition, the test data in <code>data/taskAB</code> contain all TLINKSrequired by tasks A and B, and <code>data/taskC</code> contains alllinks needed for task C. However, the relType attribute of each TLINKis set to UNKNOWN. The task is to replace the UNKNOWN values with oneof the six allowed values listed above.<p>It is not necessary to determine what events are on the Event TargetList (ETL). Recall that the Event Target list consists of those eventsthat occur 20 times or more in the corpus. A complete list of <ahref="docs/stem_frequencies.txt">stems</a> ordered on frequency isincluded in the <code>docs</code> directory (only stems occurring morethan once are added to the list).<p>The data directory has two sub directories, one with the data fortasks A and B, and one with data for task C. Both contain 20documents.<p>It should be noted that the test set included here does not quitefollow the specifications in the task definition, where we said wewould annotate 20-25 documents drawn from a source like TimeBank andthat these documents would contain at least 5 instances of every eventon the ETL. This proved to be both hard and impossible. Instead, weopted for a more traditional approach where we split TimeBank into atraining set and a test set.<h3>Annotation Procedure</h3>The EVENT and TIMEX3 annotation were taken from TimeBank(<code>http://timeml.org/site/timebank/timebank.html</code>). Theannotation procedure for TLINKs includes dual annotation by sevenannotators using a web-based annotation interface(see <a href="docs/screenshot.html">the screen shot page</a> for moredetails). After this phase, two experienced annotators looked at alloccurrences where two annotators differed as to what relation type toselect. For task C, there was an extra annotation phase where the mainevents wereselected. <a href="docs/mainevent-guidelines-v2.html">Annotationguidelines</a> for main event annotation are included in thisdistribution.<h3>Validation</h3>Included with the trial data are a <a href="validation/validate.pl"type="text/plain">Perl validation script</a> anda <a href="validation/tempeval.dtd" type="text/plain">Document TypeDefinition</a> for TempEval annotation. All files in the test sethave been validated. Note that the DTD differs from the one given inthe training set in that it allows UNKNOWN as the value of the<code>relType</code> attribute.<p>To validate TempEval files using the DTD,open a terminal window (Linux/Unix/MacOSX) or a command prompt(Windows) and type the following:<blockquote><code>% perl validate.pl ../data/taskAB</code><br><code>% perl validate.pl ../data/taskC</code></blockquote>This will write validation errors and warnings to the standardoutput. All lines with <tt>INFO-300</tt> can be ignored, ingeneral, they report on reference counts. On Unix/Linux systems, theselines can be filtered out by using:<blockquote><code>% perl validate.pl ../data/taskAB | grep -v INFO-300 </code><br><code>% perl validate.pl ../data/taskC | grep -v INFO-300 </code></blockquote><p> The script assumes the Perl modules XML::Checker and XML::RegExp,both available at CPAN (<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>).<h3>Evaluation</h3>Also included with the training data is a <ahref="scripts/scoreTLINKS.pl" type="text/plain">Perl scoringscript</a>. It measures precision and recall using a strict and arelaxed scoring scheme. See the <ahref="docs/evaluation.pdf">evaluation document</a> in the<tt>docs</tt> directory for more details.<h3>Submitting Results</h3>Results need to be submitted to the SemEval organizers by fileupload. Please prepare a zip file or gzipped tar file that containstwo directories:<blockquote><code>    taskAB/<br>	taskC/</code></blockquote>Directory <code>taskAB</code> should contain all 20 documents from<code>data/taskAB</code> with UNKNOWN values of the<code>relType</code> attribute replaced with one of the six TempEvalrelations. Similarly, <code>taskC</code> should contain all 20documents from <code>data/taskC</code> with UNKNOWN valuesreplaced. Participants who chose to not participate in task C canleave this directory empty.<h3>Questions or Comments?</h3><p>Please direct questions to <code>tempeval@timeml.org</code>.</body></html>
