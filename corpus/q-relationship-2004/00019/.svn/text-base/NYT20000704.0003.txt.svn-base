MEXICO CITY --
Swept to power by younger , better-educated voters fed up with corruption and one-party rule , President -elect Vicente Fox on Monday began the transition of Mexico from a republic headed for decades by an autocratic president to one in which political power suddenly seemed up for grabs .
As Fox fielded congratulatory phone calls Monday from world leaders , including President Clinton , and met with President Ernesto Zedillo , election returns showed that Mexican voters on Sunday had handed him a substantially more decisive victory over the governing party than any poll had predicted .
With 93 percent of the ballots tabulated , the Mexican electoral agency reported that Fox had won 43 percent of the votes , while Francisco Labastida , the candidate of the ruling party , won 36 percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , a leftist candidate , won 17 percent .
Fox will take office on Dec. 1 .
For many Mexicans , it was still sinking in Monday that after 71 years , the Institutional Revolutionary Party , which evolved from a alliance of revolutionary generals into a model nationalist party imitated across Latin America before degenerating into a clique of corrupt insiders , had finally been deposed from the presidency .
But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of power in this country 's history , for the first time none of the major parties -- the deposed one , Fox 's center-right party , or the largest leftist grouping -- will be in control of either house of Congress .
At a news conference Monday night , Fox said he had assured Zedillo that he did not intend to carry out a purge of the government bureaucracy , at least in the first stage of his new administration .
The two leaders agreed to meet frequently between now and December to plan next year 's budget and to discuss the transition , Fox added .
`` Our team will take office with creative ideas and new philosophies , but there 'll be no change in federal work rhythms , '' Fox said .
`` Mexico will be a country on the move , headed by a government that keeps its commitments . ''
Fox will preside over a government unused to coalition politics but one in which all major business will require the consent of one or the other of his rivals .
`` All the parties are going to have to relearn the art of making politics , '' said Carlos Elizondo , a political scientist who is rector of the Center for Research and Teaching in Mexico City .
`` The fundamental pillars of Mexico 's political system have changed . ''
These unsettled results were reflected around the country .
Fox 's National Action Party won the two governor 's seats up for grabs on Sunday and will now govern in seven of Mexico 's 31 states .
In Mexico City , the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution , or PRD , retained control of the mayor 's office , but the president-elect 's party took control of the City Council .
As president , Fox will face the ticklish task of meeting the hopes for quick and sweeping change of the diverse voters who backed him .
He has promised , simultaneously , to modernize the economy and spur 7 percent growth , carry out sweeping political reforms , and initiate an `` educational revolution . ''
He has pledged to better the lot not only of the largely young , middle-class professionals in his own center-right party , but also of millions of poor urban workers and farmers who have in the past supported the governing party .
`` We 've all got to get to work right away , '' Fox said in an interview early Monday , after his triumph .
`` I want to be certain to deliver good results to the people of Mexico , to govern and to govern well . ''
The election results provoked a debate over how successfully Zedillo 's party would navigate its journey from its powerhouse position into the ranks of the opposition .
Some said that the party had already proved its adaptability and resilience in states where Fox 's party had already won control of the governor 's chair .
But others , comparing the position of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as the PRI , to some communist parties in Eastern Europe , argued that without presidential support and control over federal patronage , the party would crumble .
The party 's president during the presidential campaign quickly announced her resignation , and some party officials said they feared that a sweeping exodus could follow .
The results of the elections to fill all 128 seats in the Senate and all 500 in the Chamber of Deputies indicated that Fox 's party would finish with its powers significantly enhanced , mainly at the expense of the leftist PRD , with which it shared opposition powers during the last Legislature ; but that it would not control a majority of votes .
The PRI lost the Senate majority it had enjoyed since the party 's creation and without the power of the president to coordinate its efforts , the PRI 's entire legislative delegation will wield considerably less clout .
Fox 's party was receiving 38 percent of the votes for Congress , the returns showed .
The PRI was receiving 36 percent and the PRD , 18 percent .
As the ballot-counting continued , Zedillo met privately in the presidential compound with the top PRI leaders , whose power now rests almost entirely in the provinces .
Aides said that Zedillo outlined his views of the unprecedented survival challenges facing the party , which had gone undefeated in presidential voting -- often through the simple exercise of its vast powers of patronage and pork and sometimes through outright ballot fraud -- for 71 years , longer than any other party in the world .
In a second encounter , Zedillo addressed the 21 of Mexico 's 31 state governors who belong to his party , urging them to cooperate fully with Fox 's government .
`` The PRI is like the phoenix , '' Melquiades Morales , the PRI governor of Puebla , told reporters as he entered the meeting .
`` It will rise again from its own ashes . ''
`` We 'll have to work with the new president in a relation of respect and collaboration , '' Fernando Silva , the PRI governor of the north central state of San Luis Potosi , told reporters after the meeting .
If Mexico was entering absolutely new political terrain with the PRI 's defeat , neither foreign nor domestic investors appeared concerned .
The Mexican stock market surged 6.1 percent on news of Fox 's victory , and the peso , which had been battered in recent weeks as nervous Mexicans converted savings to dollars , strengthened 2.7 percent .
`` Investors are very enthusiastic , '' said Rogelio Ramirez , president of Ecanal , a Mexico City consulting firm .
`` The market is seeing Fox as a man who can bring important changes , in the sense of modernizing the economy and the system . ''
In the interview early Monday , hours after his triumph became apparent , Fox outlined his hopes to forge tighter relations with the United States , where he attended high school in Wisconsin and has traveled extensively .
`` Fortunately , I know well the philosophy of the American people , because I 've worked all my life there both in business and in politics , '' he said .
`` I know that we are going to be able to accomplish many things together .
We can develop our great potential , which still stretches before us .
I want to work intensely with the United States because it is the world 's largest market , it 's our neighbor , it 's our partner . ''
Fox offered words of conciliation to Labastida and to Cardenas , with both of whom he had traded extraordinarily harsh criticisms during the campaign .
`` I send him my regards , I recognize his participation and his passion in defending his ideas , '' Fox said of Labastida .
In a victory speech , Fox said he would withdraw the libel suit he filed last week against his rivals , who had accused him , without providing documentation , of accepting illegal campaign donations from a Belgian company .
`` Ours is going to be a government of national concord , a government of unity , a government with its eyes fixed on the future , a government that we 're going to build with the help of all Mexicans , '' Fox said in the speech .
`` I think that 's the way to build the great nation that we all dream about . ''
Monday , Fox spent several hours at the downtown Mexico City hotel that had been his residence for a year , greeting well-wishers , speaking to reporters , and speaking to foreign leaders by phone .
President Clinton called Fox Monday morning , said Jorge Castaneda , an adviser to Fox .
`` Clinton was very cordial , very supportive , in general and in particular , '' Castaneda said that Fox told him .
`` Fox committed himself to a meeting with Clinton before Clinton leaves office .
They had a very pleasant conversation . ''
Several delegations of international observers on Monday praised the elections as well-organized and fraud-free .
Jimmy Carter called the elections `` a turning point of great significance for all those who love freedom and democracy . ''
He said reforms implemented by an autonomous federal electoral agency since the 1994 presidential balloting `` turned out to be almost perfect '' Meanwhile , analysts were scratching their head about why Fox 's victory was far more sweeping than most public opinion surveys had predicted .
Several polls had shown Fox and Labastida to be running neck and neck , but preliminary results show that Fox won by a 9-point margin .
The newspaper Reforma wrote Monday that the nearly 20 percent of Mexican voters who said they were undecided before the vote , had in reality been planning to vote for Fox , but had been disguising their anti-government sentiments .
Stanley Greenberg , the American pollster who worked on contract to the PRI during the campaign , said that Labastida 's candidacy was doomed when he failed to compete with Fox among the young , urban middle-class voters whose portion of the Mexican electorate is growing fast .
`` Given the country 's changing demographics , given the globalization of its economy , all the changes in Mexico , Labastida and the PRI simply had to attract votes beyond their longtime base in the rural areas , '' Greenberg said .
Cardenas not only went down to his worst defeat in three presidential bids , but also saw his leftist party 's power in Congress reduced considerably , the returns show .
The party 's only bright spot was the election of Andres Manuel Lopez to a six-year term at the head of the Mexico City government , which will remain the party 's stronghold .
