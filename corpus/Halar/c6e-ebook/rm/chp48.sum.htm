Highly branched dendrites collect information which is directed to the cell body and then to axons which convey signals to further locations. Synaptic terminals at the ends of axons release neurotransmitter molecules into the synapses, thereby relaying neural signals to the dendrites or cell bodies of other neurons or effectors. The simplest nerve circuit is the reflex arc, consisting of a sensory neuron which, on stimulation, signals a motor neuron. The motor neuron then signals an effector cell such as a muscle or gland cell to change its activity. Most nerve circuits, however, interpose large numbers of interneurons between the primary sites of sensing and acting. Animal brains are formed from clusters of the cell bodies of these interneurons. Neurons require the support of surrounding glial cells.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity48A:<span class="Emphasis1">

This local voltage change is a graded potential, its magnitude proportional to the strength of the stimulus. An action potential, or nerve impulse, is a rapid, transient, all-or-none depolarization of the neuron’s membrane. A local depolarization to the threshold potential opens voltage-gated sodium channels, and the rapid influx of Na<SUP>+</SUP> brings the membrane potential to a positive value. The membrane potential is restored to its normal resting value by the closing of the Na<SUP>+</SUP> channels. A refractory period follows an action potential, corresponding to the period when the voltage-gated Na<SUP>+</SUP> channels are inactivated. The frequency of action potentials varies with the intensity of the stimulus.</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in the Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">

The rate of transmission of a nerve impulse is directly related to the diameter of the axon. Saltatory conduction, a mechanism by which action potentials jump between the nodes of Ranvier of myelinated axons, speeds nervous impulses in vertebrates.</p></LI><LI><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Chemical or electrical communication between cells occurs at synapses (pp. 1033-1034,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 48.12</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Synapses between neurons conduct signals from the axon of a presynaptic cell to a dendrite or cell body of a postsynaptic cell. Electrical synapses directly pass an action potential between two neurons via gap junctions. In a chemical synapse, a depolarization stimulates the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters bind to receptor proteins associated with particular ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter is rapidly broken down by enzymes, or taken back up into surrounding cells.</p><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity48C:<span class="Emphasis1">

One of the most common invertebrate and vertebrate neurotransmitters is acetylcholine. Other transmitters that have been identified include the biogenic amines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin); several amino acids; and some neuropeptides, such as the analgesic endorphins. Some neurons also release gases, such as nitric oxide, to signal other cells.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">EVOLUTION AND DIVERSITY OF NERVOUS SYSTEMS</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para28"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The ability of cells to respond to the environment has evolved over billions of years (p. 1038)</span> Our nervous system has a very ancient history, for its basic cellular components and signaling mechanisms were present over 600 million years ago.

Derived from the embryonic dorsal hollow nerve cord, the CNS contains contiguous spaces filled with cerebro-spinal fluid.

Functionally, the PNS consists of the sensory, or afferent, division, which brings information from sensory receptors to the CNS, and the motor, or efferent, division, which carries signals away from the CNS to effector cells. The motor division consists of the somatic nervous system, which carries signals to skeletal muscles, and the autonomic nervous system, which regulates the primarily automatic, visceral functions of smooth and cardiac muscles. The autonomic nervous system consists of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions, which are usually antagonistic in effect on target organs.</p></LI><LI><a name="para32"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Embryonic development of the vertebrate brain reflects its evolution from three anterior bulges of the neural tube (pp. 1042-1043,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 48.19</span>, <span class="SmallCap">48.20</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> All vertebrate brains develop and diversify from three embryonic regions: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain.</p></LI><LI><a name="para33"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Evolutionarily older structures of the vertebrate brain regulate essential automatic and integrative functions (pp. 1043-1046,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 48.21</span>-<span class="SmallCap">48.23</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> In the human brain, the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain make up the brainstem. The medulla oblongata and pons of the hindbrain work together to control homeostatic functions such as breathing rate, and to conduct sensory and motor signals between the spinal cord and higher brain centers. The midbrain receives, integrates, and projects sensory information to the forebrain. The reticular system of the brainstem regulates cycles of sleep and wakefulness. The cerebellum is involved in learning and remembering motor responses, as well as regulating their execution. The thalamus is the main input and output center through which sensory and motor information passes to and from the cortex. The hypothalamus regulates homeostasis and basic survival behaviors such as feeding, fighting, fleeing, and reproducing. Nuclei in the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms.</p></LI><LI><a name="para34"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The cerebrum is the most highly evolved structure of the mammalian brain (pp. 1046-1047,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 48.24</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The cerebrum has two hemispheres, each of which consists of cerebral cortex overlaying internal basal nuclei that are important in learning and controlling movement.

Association areas integrate the information that comes from different sensory areas, and frontal regions then compose a motor response plan. The left hemisphere is normally specialized for focused high speed serial information processing essential to language and logic operations. The right hemisphere emphasizes more global parallel processing involved in pattern recognition, nonverbal ideation, and emotional processing. Areas in the frontal and temporal lobes are essential for the generation and understanding of language. As part of the limbic system, portions of the frontal lobes and the amygdala are involved in building an emotional repertoire. The frontal lobes are a site of short-term memory and can interact with the hippocampus and amygdala to consolidate long-term memory. Neuroscientists are increasingly optimistic that a scientific explanation of human consciousness may be attainable. We are a considerable distance, however, from understanding how the emergent property of consciousness rises from the correlated activities of the nerve cells that make up our brains and nervous systems.</p></LI><LI><a name="para36"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Research on neuron development and neural stem cells may lead to new approaches for treating CNS injuries and diseases (pp. 1051-1053,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 48.28</span>, <span class="SmallCap">48.29</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> During neuron development, signal molecules direct an axon’s growth until connections are made with the correct target cells.
