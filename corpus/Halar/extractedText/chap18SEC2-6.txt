 Plant viruses are serious agricultural pests

Plant viruses can stunt plant growth and diminish crop yields (FIGURE 18.9a). Most plant viruses discovered thus far are RNA viruses. Many of them, including the tobacco mosaic virus, have rod-shaped capsids with protein arranged in a spiral (see FIGURE 18.2a).

There are two major routes by which a plant viral disease can spread. By the first route, called horizontal transmission, a plant is infected from an external source of the virus. Since the invading virus must get past the plant's outer protective layer of cells (the epidermis), the plant becomes more susceptible to viral infections if it has been damaged by wind, chilling, injury, or insects. Insects are a double threat, because they often also act as carriers of viruses, transmitting disease from plant to plant. Farmers and gardeners may transmit plant viruses inadvertently on pruning shears and other tools. The other route of viral infection is vertical transmission, in which a plant inherits a viral infection from a parent. Vertical transmission can occur in asexual propagation (for example, by taking cuttings) or in sexual reproduction via infected seeds.

Once a virus enters a plant cell and begins reproducing, virus particles can spread throughout the plant by passing through plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic connections that penetrate the walls between adjacent plant cells (FIGURE 18.9b). Agricultural scientists have not yet devised cures for most viral diseases of plants. Therefore, their efforts have focused largely on reducing the incidence and transmission of such diseases and on breeding genetic varieties of crop plants that are relatively resistant to certain viruses.
