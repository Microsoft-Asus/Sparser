THE CYCLING OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 Biological and geologic processes move nutrients between organic and inorganic compartments



 

 Decomposition rates largely determine the rates of nutrient cycling



 

 Nutrient cycling is strongly regulated by vegetation



Although ecosystems receive an essentially inexhaustible influx of solar energy, chemical elements are available only in limited amounts. (The meteorites that occasionally strike Earth are the only extraterrestrial source of matter.) Life on Earth therefore depends on the recycling of essential chemical elements. Even while an individual organism is alive, much of its chemical stock is rotated continuously as nutrients are assimilated and waste products released. Atoms present in the complex molecules of an organism at its time of death are returned as simpler compounds to the atmosphere, water, or soil by the action of decomposers. This decomposition replenishes the pools of inorganic nutrients that plants and other autotrophs use to build new organic matter. Because nutrient circuits involve both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems, they are also called biogeochemical cycles.
