-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The United Nations has launched a $ 65 million drug control initiative in the countries that border Afghanistan , seeking to stem trafficking from the world 's top producer of opium , a senior U.N. official said Monday .
The `` security belt '' projects in Central Asia include training for border police and law enforcement officials and help in establishing national drug control agencies and policies , said Pino Arlacchi , the head of the U.N. Drug Control and Crime Program .
The target countries for the U.N. programs are Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Iran , Pakistan , Kazakstan and Kyrgyztan .
`` The problem of illicit narcotics production in Afghanistan and related trafficking has reached alarming proportions , '' Arlacchi told a closed meeting of regional representatives .
The region now has the highest rates of heroin addiction in the world and surplus production may fuel efforts to develop new markets elsewhere , Arlacchi said , according to his prepared remarks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Despite pledges by Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban militia to ban poppy cultivation , the country expanded lands under harvest and produced 4,600 metric tons of opium last year -- almost twice as much as the previous year .</ENAMEX>
A recent report from the International Narcotics Control Board , a quasi-judicial U.N. organization that monitors adherence to U.N. drug treaties , said Afghanistan now produces 75 percent of the world 's opium .
In response to the U.N. report , the Taliban 's supreme leader , Mullah Mohammed Omar , issued an edict ordering a one-third reduction in poppy cultivation .
But Taliban officials have said they cannot persuade Afghanistan 's farmers to stop cultivating the illegal crop altogether because they have no other way of supporting themselves .
The United Nations has launched pilot projects in four regions of Afghanistan to help farmers switch to non-poppy harvesting , but the organization estimates it will need dlrs 25 million a year for five years to establish alternative development projects that would wipe out production altogether , Arlacchi said in an interview .
In the meantime , the United Nations wants to stem the trafficking through border control and other projects , including projects to stem the import into Afghanistan of the chemical precursors needed to make opium .
