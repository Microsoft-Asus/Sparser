 Microevolution is a generation-to-generation change in a population's allele frequencies

The Hardy-Weinberg theorem is useful when we are studying evolution because it provides a baseline against which we can compare the allele and genotype frequencies of an evolving population. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from values predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equation, it is usually because the population is evolving.

We can now refine our definition of evolution at the population level: Evolution is a generation-to-generation change in a population's frequencies of alleles. Because such change in a gene pool is evolution on the smallest scale, it is referred to more specifically as microevolution.

Microevolution is occurring even if the frequencies of alleles are changing for only a single genetic locus. If we track allele and genotype frequencies in a population over a succession of generations, some loci may be at equilibrium while allele frequencies at other loci are changing. Such a population is evolving. For example, our imaginary wildflower population would be evolving if the frequencies of the red-flower and white-flower alleles were changing from generation to generation, even if Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium were maintained for all other genetic loci.
