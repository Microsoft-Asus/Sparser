WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Clinton administration expressed deep concern Tuesday over a warning by China that it could use force if Taiwan delays indefinitely reunification talks with Beijing .
U.S. diplomats relayed the administration 's concerns to Chinese authorities in Beijing and Washington just a day after China issued the threat in an 11,000-page position paper .
At the White House , presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart rejected the Chinese threat and recalled that the United States sent two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region to calm a crisis four years ago .
`` We reject any use of force or any threat of force in this situation , '' Lockhart said .
`` We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement between the sides is the way to move forward , '' he said .
`` We have repeated , I think , in both actions and words that we view any threat to Taiwan with grave concern . ''
Meanwhile , Stanley O. Roth , assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Chinese position paper was `` obviously a source of concern for us '' and appeared to be contrary to `` the policy that is the bedrock of our relations '' with both China and Taiwan .
Members of Congress , where support for Taiwan runs strong , suggested the administration was not repudiating the Chinese statement with enough force .
`` We need to articulate more clearly where we are , '' said Sen. Craig Thomas , R - Wyo. , chairman of the East Asian and Pacific subcommittee .
Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , said that China 's statement `` is unacceptable '' and that the administration had the responsibility to make sure that China `` not misinterpret where we are -- in one way or the other . ''
At the State Department , spokesman James P. Rubin described as a new formulation China 's threat to use force if there is an indefinite delay in reunification talks .
`` We find the formulation troubling ; we do n't find it particularly helpful , '' he said .
At the same time , he said it would be a mistake to exaggerate the significance of the Chinese statement .
`` We 've had much worse periods on this question in the past , '' he said .
He added that the administration is not considering any change in its opposition to legislation before Congress to strengthen U.S. - Taiwanese military relations .
Rubin said military ties with Taiwan , authorized under the Taiwan Relations Act , has enabled the United States to be `` second-to-none '' in its support of the anti-communist bastion .
He said that arrangement has served U.S. interests extremely well .
`` We believe that support has made a difference as recently as 1996 .
And so nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national interest , '' Rubin said .
In 1996 , China fired nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan 's two largest ports , prompting the United States to send two aircraft carriers and other warships to the region .
China 's muscle-flexing at the time was related to the impending presidential elections at the time .

<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Analysts said China seems intent on discouraging support for the candidate most identified with the pro-independence sector on Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Lockhart recalled that in 1996 , `` we responded appropriately to what was viewed as a threat .
And that should give you some indication of how we view this situation . ''
Lin Chong -pin , Taiwan 's vice chairman of a council that handles Taiwan 's China policy , would not directly address the new threat but said tensions would not ease as long as Beijing refuses to acknowledge that China is split and each side is controlled by a separate government .
`` Until we unify , both sides of course will have different views about what ` one China ' means , '' Lin said .
The latest flare-up comes amid President Clinton 's drive to win congressional approval of permanent trading benefits for China , part of a trade-opening deal to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization , which sets the rules for global trade .
Opponents of the deal are likely to seize on the new Chinese stand in hopes of blocking the trade package .
But Lockhart insisted that it should not affect the vote .
`` The agreement is very much in our country 's interest and our national interest , '' he said .
`` This is a one-sided agreement benefiting American business , American workers , American families .
We should move forward on that basis . ''
