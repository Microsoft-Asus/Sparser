-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">A British businessman has agreed to pay $ 100 million for a week-long ride on Russia 's Mir space station , giving the aging outpost a new lease on life , Russian officials said today .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But a spokesman for the nation 's top space authority expressed doubts , saying the deal may collapse like many previous attempts to raise private funds to keep the Mir aloft .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Peter Llewelyn , 51 , signed an agreement for the August flight with the state-controlled RKK Energia company , which runs the Mir , said Energia 's spokesman Sergei Gromov .
He said the agreement had been signed over the weekend and the money would be transferred to Energia soon .</ENAMEX>
Gromov said Llewelyn lives in the United States , is married and has two children , but would not give further details .
Llewelyn will fly to the Mir in a Soyuz rocket accompanied by two Russian cosmonauts .
After a week in space , he will return to Earth with the Mir 's current crew , Gromov said .
If the deal works , it would be a big relief for Russian space officials and cosmonauts , who are eager to extend the lifetime of the Mir -- the last symbol of the nation 's fading space glory .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The Russian government has said it would only pay for the Mir through the end of August .
It would then abandon the station unless private investors come up with new money .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Space officials have repeatedly claimed that they had found unidentified investors , but the deals have crumbled each time .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Llewelyn 's contribution would cover about half of the Mir 's annual maintenance costs .
But Sergei Gorbunov , a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency , threw cold water on Energia 's enthusiasm , pointing at previously announced deals that have collapsed .</ENAMEX>
`` All of us will be very happy if they find an enthusiast eager to finance the Mir , but I think it 's too early yet to celebrate , '' he said by telephone .
The Mir , launched in February 1986 , has operated far longer than any other space station .
It endured a long series of breakdowns and accidents in 1997 but has been running relatively trouble-free since then .
The U.S. space agency NASA has long pushed Russia to abandon the Mir and commit its scarce resources to a new international space station , which is more than a year behind schedule because of Energia 's failure to build a key segment .
Energia has blamed delays in government funding .
Russians ' reluctance to abandon Mir also stems from their feeling that without a space station of their own , they will be left playing a secondary role to Americans in the new project .
The first two components of the new station were launched last November and December .
Energia on Monday announced the completion of the station 's next module 's construction , but its launch date is still months away .
The module will now be sent to the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan for a long series of pre-launch tests .
