The earliest progymnosperms were seedless plants, but by the end of the Devonian period, seeds had evolved in some progymnosperm species. Adaptive radiation during the Carboniferous and early Permian produced the various phyla of gymnosperms.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">In the history of life, the Permian period was one of great crises. Formation of the supercontinent Pangaea (see Chapter 25) may have been one reason that continental interiors became warmer and drier as the Permian progressed. The flora and fauna of Earth changed dramatically, as many groups of organisms disappeared and others emerged as their successors. The changeover was most pronounced in the seas, but terrestrial life was affected as well. In the animal kingdom, amphibians decreased in diversity and were replaced by reptiles, which were especially well adapted to the arid conditions. Similarly, the lycophytes, horsetails, and ferns that dominated the Carboniferous swamps were largely replaced by gymnosperms, which were more suited to the drier climate. The world and its life had changed so markedly that geologists use the end of the Permian period, about 245 million years ago, as the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. (This boundary was originally defined by the changeover in marine fossils.) The terrestrial animals of the Mesozoic, including the dinosaurs, were supported by a vegetation consisting mostly of conifers and great palmlike cycads, two phyla of gymnosperms. At the end of the Mesozoic, a powerful meteorite or comet impact and intensive volcanic activity contributed to a cooler climate, and the dinosaurs became extinct. Many of the gymnosperms persisted, however, and are still an important part of Earth's flora.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
