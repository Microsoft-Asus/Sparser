SAN FRANCISCO --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Is the libertarian high-tech industry on the verge of embracing government regulation ?
That 's what it sounded like last week , when Bill Joy , chief scientist for Sun Microsystems , told a conference at the University of California at Berkeley that biotechnology had such great potential for misuse by terrorists that geneticists ought to quit posting some genome sequence data on the Internet and help create a governmental body to regulate risky experiments .</ENAMEX>
Joy , who achieved fame in computing for helping create the Unix operating system , has emerged in recent months as the Cassandra of self-inflicted technological peril .
In an April article in Wired magazine , Joy warned that humans are on the verge of creating powerful computers , genetically enhanced organisms and microscopic robots that have the potential to replicate and evolve -- creations that might one day turn on their makers .
`` Look at what happened to the other creatures on this planet because of us , '' Joy said at last week 's biotech conference .
`` I do n't think we should expect to be treated any better '' if we allow self-replicating technologies to develop uncontrolled .
Joy 's dinner speech , given to biotech executives and scientists who had gathered for a conference at UC Berkeley last week , focused on the dangers of studying infectious microbes .
Joy suggested it was foolish for the biologists who determined the sequence of the smallpox vaccine to post this data on the central Web site where all genome data is shared .
`` If we make the tools -LRB- for analyzing genetic data -RRB- so powerful that delusional people can use them , '' we could find ourselves under attack one day by `` designer pathogens , '' Joy said .
He suggested that certain types of biological knowledge should be restricted to medical professionals with a valid need to know .
He ridiculed a similar project that is still under way .
Scientific teams in the United States and Britain are trying to extract viral samples from corpses frozen during the 1918 flu epidemic , to sequence that microbe and learn why it was so contagious .
This , Joy suggested , is the sort of experiment that should be cleared by an `` international technology assessment committee '' authorized to halt projects deemed dangerous .
I located the U.S. scientist who sequenced the smallpox virus , and the British researcher who is studying the 1918 flu bug , to discuss Joy 's concerns .
Joe Esposito , a virologist with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , said he undertook the smallpox project in the early 1990s to understand the virus in case it flares up again .
Esposito said he enlisted the aid of Craig Venter -- of human genome fame -- and after Venter 's lab sequenced the virus , they posted the data on the Web site where all genetic sequences are put for the world to see .
I explained Joy 's concerns , and his suggestion that access to such `` intrinsically dangerous '' data be restricted to authorized medical Pros .
Esposito disagreed .
`` If you put information under lock and key , it blocks innovation , '' Esposito said .
`` You 're not gonna give a rookie researcher the keys to the dangerous data , but it might be the rookie who has the brainstorm . ''
But Sir John Skehel , director of the National Institute for Medical Research in London , said he is n't sure he will publish the sequence data if he is indeed able to reconstruct the genetic material of the 1918 flu bug .
Skehel 's researchers are trying to extract viral genetic material from plague victims frozen in the permafrost in Norway .
So far , they have been unsuccessful .
But , Skehel said , U.S. viral experts have had better luck .
They 've already isolated and sequenced two of the eight genes in the flu bug and published their data .
However , subsequent criticisms , predating Joy 's , have caused scientists on both sides of the Atlantic to rethink whether they should publish the rest of the flu genes , if they can indeed be isolated .
`` The secrecy of information is a new thing for biologists , '' Skehel said in a telephone interview from London .
`` People have held meetings to talk about what should and should not be done . ''
Joy 's message of self-censorship and self-restraint met with polite applause from the biotech crowd at the UC Berkeley conference .
Attendees seemed to think he raised valid concerns , even if some of his suggestions were antithetical to the scientific norm of sharing information .
-LRB- You can read Joy 's recommendations in an April 18 Op - Ed piece in the Washington Post . -RRB-
`` A lot of his comments resonated fairly well with many of the people there , '' said David Kingsbury , a White House science adviser during the 1980s and now a biotechnology consultant .
For instance , meeting-goers liked Joy 's suggestion that biotechnologists create a code of ethics , or Hippocratic Oath .
However , the Biotechnology Industry Organization already asks members to subscribe to such an ethics policy .
But Kingsbury questioned Joy 's comment that some forms of knowledge carry such `` intrinsic danger '' that they must be censored .
`` Some of us felt Bill had taken a step beyond where we need to go , '' Kingsbury said .
Ed Penhoet , dean of public health school at UC Berkeley and a conference organizer , observed that Joy 's suggestions were tough to swallow given that `` he comes from a world that is resisting even the smallest increment of regulation . ''
In fact , the high-tech industry has just spent eight years browbeating the Clinton administration to relax export controls on encryption and supercomputing .
U.S. criminal authorities have sought to control code-making software for fear it will enable terrorists to conceal their plots .
Defense experts want to keep supercomputers from foreign nations that might use them to design nuclear weapons or missiles .
Sun Microsystems has said these restrictions steal sales from Silicon Valley without improving security because firms in other nations are free to export both technologies .
When I e-mailed Joy about this , he said he had always disagreed with his company on encryption and felt that some controls on code-software were needed .
So even if Joy 's new positions are consistent with his past beliefs , he is still wrong to suggest that we 'll be more secure by wrapping aspects of biology in the sort of secrecy that surrounds nuclear weapons .
Who classifies biological facts ?
Who gets access ?
Do we create a Livermore and Los Alamos for biotechnology ?
Nuclear weapons have not been controlled through secrecy .
Knowledge is not , as Joy suggests , intrinsically dangerous .
Anyone who cares to know how to build an atom bomb already knows what to do .
The fact that there are n't more members of the nuclear club owes to the fact that few nations have the technological ability to refine plutonium or build detonation triggers .
Joy is correct in pointing out that it will be easier to misuse biotech because the equipment and techniques are more readily available .
Any drug research lab is a potential center for bio-terrorism .
Should we equip them with surveillance cams , or subject them to periodic random inspections ?
It 's preposterous to assert that gene sequence data is intrinsically dangerous .
I 've seen gene sequences .
They 're a gibberish of ATGCs .
It takes a trained microbiologist to see the meaning .
So if we 're afraid of terrorists or other nations misusing this knowledge , we must not only control the data .
We must also stop training the foreigners who make up roughly half of the graduate student populace in U.S. universities .
So , Bill , thank you for your concern .
They worry all of us .
But putting barbed wire around biology is n't the solution .
