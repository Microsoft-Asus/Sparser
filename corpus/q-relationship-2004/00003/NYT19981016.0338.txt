LONDON --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The 1998 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to John Hume and David Trimble , leaders of the largest Catholic and Protestant political parties in Northern Ireland , for their efforts to bring peace to the long-polarized British province .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , 61 , the Catholic head of the Social Democratic and Labor Party , was cited by the Nobel Committee in Oslo for having been `` the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland 's political leaders in his work for a peaceful solution . ''</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble , 54 , the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionists , was honored for having demonstrated `` great political courage when , at a critical stage in the process , he advocated solutions which led to the peace agreement . '</ENAMEX>'
A leader of a third prominent party , Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army , was not named as a prize winner .
Nor were several other figures mentioned as possibilities , including former Sen. George Mitchell , who led the talks , Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland , President Clinton , and Mo Mowlam , the British government 's secretary for Northern Ireland .
The accord , signed on April 10 and known as the Good Friday Agreement , has given the 1.7 million residents of Northern Ireland a respite from the sectarian violence that has claimed more than 3,200 lives in the last 30 years .
It has also opened the possibility of lasting stability for the first time since the establishment of Northern Ireland with partition from Ireland in 1921 .
Forging concessions from fiercely antagonistic populations , the accord seeks to balance the Protestant majority 's wish to remain part of Britain with Catholic desires to strengthen ties to the Irish Republic to the south .
The committee , seeing in Northern Ireland 's two warring groups a dispute with notable similarities to violent tribal confrontations elsewhere , expressed the hope that the accord would serve `` to inspire peaceful solutions to other religious , ethnic and national conflicts around the world . ''
While it did not honor Adams , the committee said it wished to `` emphasize the importance of the positive contributions to the peace process made by other Northern Irish leaders . ''
Asked if the prize givers had `` shied away '' from Adams because of his past association with violence , the chairman of the secretive five-man committee , Francis Sejersted , said : `` We do n't shy away from anybody .
We just try to pick the most worthy people . ''
Adams , he said , was `` clearly one of those who has contributed significantly to the process so far . ''
Adams was almost certainly on the list of 139 nominees because the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Friday implied strongly that it had considered him for the prize but decided to limit it to Hume and Trimble .
The two men will share the prize money of $ 960,000 .
Nominations can be made by university professors , members of national legislatures , former Nobel laureates , members of the Nobel Committee and a number of other people considered qualified .
The committee itself releases the number of nominations but does not identify the nominees or or even confirm a name .
In 1994 , the Nobel Committee included Yasser Arafat , the Palestinian leader , as a prize winner with the Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres .
One committee member , Kaare Kristiansen , resigned in protest , calling Arafat `` a terrorist . ''
Explaining why the committee selected the two men from the number of people associated with the Good Friday Agreement , Sejersted said , `` There is one from the Catholic side and one from the Protestant side , so I do not fear that it is going to alienate any of the other parties in the process . ''
Adams , in New York on a fund-raising trip for Sinn Fein , welcomed the Oslo announcement and particularly praised Hume , who is widely seen as having helped persuade the IRA to adopt a cease-fire and having eased Sinn Fein 's entry into the talks .
`` Indeed , there would be no peace process but for his courage and vision , '' Adams said , adding , ` No one deserves this accolade more . ''
He also said the prize imposed on everyone the responsibility to `` push ahead through the speedy implementation of the agreement . ''
The immediate next steps are the creation in the new power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly of a 10-member executive that will in effect be the new government of the province , and a cross-border body linking the North with the Irish Republic , one of the key attractions in the pact to the Catholic minority .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble , who is the first minister of the new legislature</ENAMEX> , faces pressure from dissidents in his quarrelsome party who insist that the IRA must start disarming before Sinn Fein can take up the positions in the Assembly that its vote total in June elections entitles it to .
In the unforgiving politics of Northern Ireland , the Unionist dissidents and members of other Protestant parties who did not join in the peace talks attacked both Trimble and Hume Friday .
Ian Paisley Jr. , son of the head of the Democratic Unionist Party , called the Nobel Committee 's decision a `` farce '' and said of the winners , `` These people have not delivered peace , and they are not peacemakers . ''
Trimble said Friday that he was `` slightly uncomfortable '' with the award because so many other people had been involved beside him in reaching the settlement and much remained to be done to put it in place .
`` We know that while we have the makings of peace , it is not wholly secure yet , '' he told the BBC from Denver , where he was on an 11-city North American mission to spur foreign investment in Ulster .
`` I hope it does not turn out to be premature . ''
Hume received word of the prize at his home in Londonderry and termed it `` an expression of the total endorsement of the work of very many people . ''
He added : `` This is n't just an award to David Trimble and myself .
It is an award to all the people in Northern Ireland . ''
Friday was the second time the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to figures in the Northern Ireland conflict .
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan , two Belfast women , won it in 1976 for mobilizing Catholics and Protestants to stage rallies calling for an end to violence .
They acted after three children of Miss Corrigan 's sister were killed when they were struck by an IRA gunman 's getaway car .
