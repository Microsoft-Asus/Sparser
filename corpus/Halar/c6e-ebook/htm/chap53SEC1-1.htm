Ecologists define the boundaries of a particular community to fit their research questions. We might study the community of decomposers and other organisms in a rotting log, the benthic community in Lake Superior, or the community of trees and shrubs in Shenandoah National Park. A community has a set of properties defined by its species composition, with a structure determined by the interactions between the species. Communities differ dramatically in their <span class="Emphasis2">species richness,</span> the number of species that they contain. But some species are common and some are rare, and so communities also differ in their <span class="Emphasis2">relative abundance</span> of different species. What causes each community to have a certain assemblage of species? Two very different answers to this question have polarized community ecologists for over 50 years.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
