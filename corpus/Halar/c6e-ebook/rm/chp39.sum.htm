Produced primarily in the apical meristem of the shoot, auxin simulates cell elongation in different target tissues. Cytokinins, produced in actively growing tissues such as roots, embryos, and fruits, stimulate cell division. Gibberellins produced in roots and young leaves stimulate growth in leaves and stems. Abscisic acid maintains dormancy in seeds. Ethylene helps control fruit ripening. Brassinosteroids, chemically similar to the sex hormones of animals, induce cell elongation and division.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity39A:<span class="Emphasis1">
