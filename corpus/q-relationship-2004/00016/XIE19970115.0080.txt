JOHANNESBURG , January 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South African President Nelson Mandela said here today his government would not be influenced by other countries in dealing with the arms sale problem .
Apparently referring to American criticism of the proposed South Africa 's 638 million U.S. Dollars weapons deal with Syria , Mandela told reporters that no country would be allowed to dictate South Africa on how it ran its affairs .
Mandela said western countries should not expect South Africa to avoid befriending their enemies .
On proposed sale of an electronic tank-sighting system to Syria , Mandela said the cabinet will meet soon to make a decision on the matter .
`` The decision we will take on the issue will be purely decided upon in the interests of South Africa , not by the influence of any other country or government , '' Mandela said .
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said on Monday the cabinet conditionally agreed last month to sell Syria South Africa -made tank firing control systems , but a final decision will not be made until the end of this January .
Also on Monday , U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Washington was deeply concerned about the possible arms sale to Syria , warning it might stop aid to South Africa if arms deal went ahead .
