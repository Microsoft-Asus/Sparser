JERUSALEM --
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian president Yasser Arafat met late into Tuesday night for their first substantive meeting aimed at hammering out the details of advancing the long-stalled peace process .
And when the two men emerged from the meeting it was clear they still had more work to do .
Barak told reporters at a press conference that Arafat would respond within two weeks to an Israeli proposal to delay implementation of parts of the interim peace deal known as the Wye River agreement .
Barak added that if Arafat rejected his proposal to fold Wye into the larger framework of the final phase of the peace process , that Israel would still implement Wye .
`` We are committed to Wye .
We will implement Wye , '' Barak said .
But standing next to Barak at the press conference , Arafat seemed to offer a clear answer to Barak that ruled out straying from the accord .
`` I have heard his idea and I have replied , '' Arafat said .
`` I told Prime Minister Barak that it is very necessary to immediately begin the full implementation of the Wye agreeement . ''
Arafat said he also called on Barak `` to cease all settlement activities which are illegal and destructive to the peace process . ''
The Wye agreement signed last October in Washington calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent more West Bank land to Palestinian rule , to release political prisoners , to allow construction of a new seaport to begin , and to open the so-called `` safe passage '' routes connecting the pockets of Palestinian control from Hebron to Gaza .
It also calls for the Palestinians to do more to fight against terrorism aimed at Israeli civilians and to curtail anti- Israeli rhetoric that incites violence .
The blunt disagreement between the two men over implementation of Wye seemed to cast a shadow over the promise that the newly elected Barak had brought to a peace process that had been characterized by mistrust under the leadership of his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu .
Palestinian Authority Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo , who participated in part of the meeting , described the disagreement over implementation of the Wye accord to Reuters as a `` crisis . ''
Barak and Arafat met for more than two hours as a warm breeze swept the desert and a full moon rose over the Erez Checkpoint at the dusty border crossing between Israel and Palestinian -ruled Gaza .
In many ways the meeting was a test of the still developing relationship between Barak and Arafat .
And the body language of the two leaders Tuesday night , as they shook hands warmly and smiled for the cameras , indicated that despite their differences of opinion they were still working together .
Ali Jarbawi , a political science professor at Ber Zeit University in the Palestinian -controlled West Bank , said , `` It was a very disappointing meeting for Palestinians . ''
`` Wye was supposed to be the minimum withdrawal we would accept before the next phase of withdrawals came .
Now it is being presented as all the Palestinians will get before the move to final status talks , '' he said .
`` Barak is saying precisely the same thing as Netanyahu , only his accent is different . ''
Israeli analysts say the meeting marks the end of the newly elected prime minister 's grace period .
He will now have to do more than state his intention to carry out the peace process , and actually deliver on his promises .
That is , if he wants to please the voters who handed him an overwhelming victory in large part because of his promise to get the peace process back on track .
`` Now the grueling work must finally begin , '' Ze 'ev Schiff , the military analyst for the daily newspaper Ha 'aretz , wrote in Tuesday 's editions .
`` Barak must pay off his debts instead of dining off declarations and promises . ''
