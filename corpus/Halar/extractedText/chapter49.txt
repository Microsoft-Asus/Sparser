In the gathering dusk a male moth's antennae detect the chemical attractant of a female moth somewhere upwind. The male takes to the air, following the scent trail toward the female. Suddenly, vibration sensors in the moth's abdomen signal the presence of ultrasonic chirps of a rapidly approaching bat. The bat's sonar enables the mammal to locate moths and other flying insect prey. Reflexively, the moth's nervous system alters the motor output to its wing muscles, sending the insect into an evasive spiral toward the ground. Although it is probably too late for the moth in the photograph on this page, many moths can escape because they can detect a bat's sonar about 30 m away. The bat has to be within 3 m to sense the moth, but since the bat flies faster, it may still have time to detect, home in, and catch its prey.

The outcome of this interaction depends on the abilities of both predator and prey to sense important environmental stimuli and to produce appropriate coordinated movement. Although not all of an animal's moment-by-moment interactions with its environment are as dramatic as such predator-prey struggles, the detection and processing of sensory information and the generation of motor output provide the physiological basis for all animal behavior.

In Chapter 48 we examined how the nervous system transmits and integrates sensory and motor information, finishing with a description of our human brains. We start this chapter with a brief overview of how sensory and motor information is processed in our brains. Then we will examine in a number of different animal groups both the sensory receptors that receive information from the environment and also the structure and function of muscles, the motor effectors that bring about movement in response to that information. We will also study skeletons in the context of body movement.

INTRODUCTION TO SENSORY RECEPTION

 

 Sensory receptors transduce stimulus energy and transmit signals to the nervous system



 

 Sensory receptors are categorized by the type of energy they transduce



As you learned in Chapter 48, information is transmitted through the nervous system in the form of nerve impulses, or action potentials, which are all-or-none events (see FIGURE 48.8c). An action potential triggered by light striking the eye is the same as an action potential triggered by air vibrating in the ear. The ability to distinguish any type of stimulus, such as sight or sound, depends on the part of the brain that receives the signal. What matters is where impulses go, not what triggers them.

Action potentials that reach the brain via sensory neurons are called sensations. Once the brain is aware of sensations, it interprets them, giving us the perception of the stimuli. Perceptions, such as colors, smells, sounds, and tastes, are constructions of the brain and do not exist outside it. So, if a tree falls and no one is present to hear it, is there a sound? The fall certainly produces pressure waves in the air, but if sound is defined as a perception, then there is none unless sensory receptors detect the waves and an animal's brain perceives them.





PHOTORECEPTORS AND VISION

 Vertebrates have single-lens eyes



 

 The light-absorbing pigment rhodopsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway



 

 The retina assists the cerebral cortex in processing visual information



A great variety of light detectors has evolved in the animal kingdom, from simple clusters of cells that detect only the direction and intensity of light to complex organs that form images. Despite their diversity, all photoreceptors contain similar pigment molecules that absorb light, and most, if not all, photoreceptors in the animal kingdom may be homologous. Animals as diverse as flatworms, annelids, arthropods, and vertebrates have some of the same, ancient genes associated with the development of photoreceptors in embryos. Thus, the genetic underpinnings of all photoreceptors may have evolved in the earliest bilateral animals (see Chapter 33). The actual eyes that form in an animal depend on developmental patterns regulated by genetic mechanisms that evolved later in the animal's taxonomic group, and whose effects appear to be superimposed on the ancient, homologous mechanism.





HEARING AND EQUILIBRIUM

 

 The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear



 

 The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium



 

 A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians



 

 Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive



Hearing and the perception of body equilibrium, or balance, are related in most animals. Both involve the formation of sensations by mechanoreceptors containing hair cells that produce receptor potentials when the hairs are bent by settling particles or moving fluid. In mammals and most other terrestrial vertebrates, the sensory organs for hearing and equilibrium are closely associated within fluid-filled canals in the ear.





CHEMORECEPTION--TASTE AND SMELL

 

 Perceptions of taste and smell are usually interrelated



Many animals use their chemical senses to find mates (as when male silk moths respond to pheromones emitted by females), to recognize territory that has been marked by some chemical substance (as when dogs and cats sniff boundaries that have been staked out by their spraying neighbors), and to help navigate during migration (as when salmon use the unique scent of their streams of origin to return for breeding). Chemical "conversation" is especially important for animals, such as ants and bees, that live in large social groups. In all animals, taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are important in feeding behavior. For example, a hydra begins to swallow when chemoreceptors detect the compound glutathione, which is released from prey captured by the hydra's tentacles.





MOVEMENT AND LOCOMOTION

 

 Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity



 

 Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement



 

 Physical support on land depends on adaptations of body proportions and posture



 

 Muscles move skeletal parts by contracting



 

 Interactions between myosin and actin generate force during muscle contractions



 

 Calcium ions and regulatory proteins control muscle contraction



 

 Diverse body movements require variation in muscle activity



Movement is a hallmark of animals. To catch food, an animal must either move through its environment or move the surrounding water or air past itself. Sessile animals such as sponges and many cnidarians stay put, but they wave tentacles that capture prey or use beating cilia to generate water currents that draw and trap small food particles (see Chapter 33). Most animals, however, are mobile and spend a considerable portion of their time and energy actively searching for food, as well as escaping from danger and looking for mates. Locomotion, or active travel from place to place, is our focus here.





 The brain's processing of sensory input and motor output is cyclical rather than linear

We can trace the origins of sensing and acting back to the appearance, in simple prokaryotes, of cellular structures able to sense pressure or chemicals in the environment and then direct movement in an appropriate direction. These structures have been transformed during evolution into diverse mechanisms specialized to sense different types of energy and generate many different levels of physical movement in response. Alongside the evolution of the wide variety of sensory receptors that we will describe in the first section of this chapter, the brain mechanisms described in Chapter 48 also evolved. These processes in the brain interpret sensory input and organize motor output to the different kinds of effector organs described in the second portion of the chapter.

Although it is customary to think of sensations causing brain changes which then cause action as a linear process--sensing  brain analysis  action--such a description implies that an animal is rather like a computer passively waiting for instructions before it acts. This is not the case. All animals are in constant motion, probing the environment with that motion, sensing the changes that result, and then using the information to generate the next action. This is a continuous cycle rather than a linear sequence, the brain carrying on background activity which is constantly updated as sensing and acting proceed (FIGURE 49.1).

Fig 49-1. Catching a fly ball is no simple feat. From the moment the bat makes contact, a cycle of sensory input, processing in the brain, and responses by muscles eventually place the fielder's glove in the right place at the right time. Brain activity is constantly updated as it senses how the position of the body and glove relative to the ball's flight has been changed by the previous instant's motor output. And, of course, experience (learning and practice) enhance this marvel of coordination.

Sensations begin as different forms of energy such as light, heat, sound, and smells are detected by specialized sensory receptor cells and ultimately converted to action potentials that travel to the brain. In most vertebrates, sensory signals generally go first to the thalamus, the gateway to the cerebral cortex (see FIGURE 48.20). This gateway is influenced by instructions coming back from the cortex selecting which sensory input seems more important at the moment. The information is then sent on to the many parts of the brain that contribute to forming our perceptions, our awareness and interpretation of the stimuli. For example, information relevant to identifying sounds or visual objects streams mainly to regions of the temporal lobes, while information about their motion and location is sent to the parietal lobes. Limbic regions are central in determining the importance of the sensory input to the organism (see FIGURES 48.24b and 48.27). Our memories of similar sounds and objects can strongly influence our final perceptions, so that in some cases we perceive what we expect to hear or see, rather than what is really there. Thus the process of perception starts with a fairly simple input--information about physical sensations carried by action potentials to the brain--and ends with a very complex result that can be biased by our history of sensing.

This description of simple sensations leading to complex perceptions invites a comparison with the subsequent motor actions that drive behaviors. A relatively simple outcome--action potentials in many motor neurons driving the contraction of striated muscles to produce a single coordinated behavior--has an extremely complex beginning. At the same time that information about the location, identity, and meaning of objects in the world streams forward to higher centers in the frontal lobes associated with making behavioral choices, motor-planning regions of the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum are evaluating a vast array of learned skills--movement programs that are potential responses. The single motor behavior chosen for the next moment is the result of a very complex decision-making mechanism.

We considered the complexity of information processing in the brain in Chapter 48, and we wanted to remind you of that complexity at the beginning of this chapter. However, the main purpose of this chapter is not to deal further with these cognitive processes, but rather to examine, in several different invertebrate and vertebrate groups, the beginning and the end of sensing and acting. We start first with sensory processes--how information about the external and internal environment is collected and conveyed to the brain--and then consider the structure and function of muscles that carry out the movement instructions generated by the brain.





 Sensory receptors transduce stimulus energy and transmit signals to the nervous system

Sensations, and the perceptions they evoke in the brain, begin with sensory reception, the detection of the energy of a stimulus by sensory cells. Most sensory receptors are specialized neurons or epithelial cells that exist singly or in groups with other cell types within sensory organs, such as the eyes and ears. Sensory receptors called exteroreceptors detect stimuli outside the body, such as heat, light, pressure, and chemicals. Other sensory receptors called interoreceptors detect stimuli within the body, such as blood pressure and body position.

All stimuli represent forms of energy, and the general function of receptor cells is to convert the energy of stimuli into changes in membrane potentials and then transmit signals to the nervous system. This task consists of four functions: sensory transduction, amplification, transmission, and integration.

Sensory Transduction

The actual detection of a stimulus involves the conversion of stimulus energy into a change in the membrane potential of a receptor cell, a process called sensory transduction. The initial response of the sensory receptor to a stimulus is a change in its membrane permeability, resulting in a graded change in membrane potential called a receptor potential. (Recall from Chapter 48 that a graded potential is a change in the voltage across the membrane that is proportional to the strength of the stimulus.) In some cases a stimulus such as pressure can stretch the membrane and increase ion flow. In other cases, specific receptor molecules on the membrane of a receptor cell open or close gates to ion channels when the stimulus is present. FIGURE 49.2 (p. 1060) illustrates the example of sugar triggering a receptor potential that functions in our sense of taste. We will examine other specific examples of sensory transduction later in the chapter.

Amplification

The strengthening of stimulus energy that is otherwise too weak to be carried into the nervous system is called amplification. Amplification of the signal may occur in accessory structures of a complex sense organ, as when sound waves are enhanced by a factor of more than 20 before reaching the receptors of the inner ear. Amplification also may be a part of the transduction process itself. An action potential conducted from the eye to the brain has about 100,000 times as much energy as the few photons of light that triggered it. Signal transduction pathways in the receptor cells contribute to this amplification (see FIGURE 49.2).

Transmission

Once the energy in the stimulus has been transduced into a receptor potential, transmission, or the conduction of impulses to the CNS (central nervous system), can occur. In some instances, such as in the case of "pain cells," the receptor itself is actually a sensory neuron that conducts action potentials to the CNS. Other receptors are separate cells that must transmit chemical signals (neurotransmitters) across synapses to sensory neurons (see FIGURE 49.2). If the receptor also functions as the sensory neuron, the intensity of the receptor potential will affect the frequency of action potentials that travel as sensations to the CNS. For separate receptor cells, the strength of the stimulus and receptor potential affect the amount of neurotransmitter released by the receptor at its synapse with a sensory neuron, which in turn determines the frequency of action potentials generated by the sensory neuron. Many sensory neurons spontaneously generate signals at a low rate. Therefore, a stimulus does not really switch the production of action potentials on or off; it modulates their frequency (FIGURE 49.2 illustrates this phenomenon). In this way the CNS is sensitive not only to the presence or absence of a stimulus but also to changes in stimulus intensity.

Integration

The processing of information, or integration, begins as soon as information is first received. Signals from receptors are integrated through the summation of graded potentials, as are those within the nervous system. One type of integration by receptor cells is sensory adaptation, a decrease in responsiveness during continued stimulation (not to be confused with the term adaptation as used in an evolutionary context). Without sensory adaptation, you would feel every beat of your heart and every bit of clothing on your body. Receptors are selective in the information they send to the CNS, and adaptation reduces the likelihood that a continuous stimulus will be transmitted.

Another important aspect of sensory integration is the sensitivity of the receptors. The threshold for transduction by receptor cells varies with conditions. For example, the thresholds of glucose receptors in the human mouth can vary over several orders of magnitude of sugar concentration as both the general state of nutrition and the amount of sugar in the diet change.

The integration of sensory information occurs at all levels within the nervous system, and the cellular actions just described are only the first steps. Complex receptors such as the eyes have higher levels of integration as signals converge on sensory nerves, and the CNS further processes all incoming signals.





 Sensory receptors are categorized by the type of energy they transduce

Based on the type of energy they detect (transduce), sensory receptors fall into five categories: mechanoreceptors, pain receptors, thermoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and electromagnetic receptors. One amazing feature of many of these receptors is that they can detect the smallest physical unit of stimulus possible. Most photoreceptors can detect a single quantum (photon) of light, chemoreceptors can detect a single molecule or odorant, and the mechanoreceptor cells of our inner ear can detect a motion of only a few angstroms.

Mechanoreceptors are stimulated by physical deformation caused by such stimuli as pressure, touch, stretch, motion, and sound--all forms of mechanical energy. Bending or stretching of the plasma membrane of a mechanoreceptor cell increases its permeability to both sodium and potassium ions, resulting in a depolarization (receptor potential).

The human sense of touch relies on mechanoreceptors that are actually modified dendrites of sensory neurons (FIGURE 49.3). Receptors that detect light touch are close to the surface of the skin; they transduce very slight inputs of mechanical energy into receptor potentials. Receptors responding to strong pressure and vibrations in the body are in deep skin layers. Other touch receptors detect hair movement--the sensitivity of a cat's whiskers is an example.

Fig 49-3. Sensory receptors in human skin. Each mechanoreceptor is a modified dendrite of a sensory neuron. Most receptors in the inner layer of the skin (dermis) are encapsulated by one or more layers of connective tissue. Those in the outer skin layers (epidermis) and touch receptors wound around the base of hairs are naked dendrites. Touch receptors at the base of the stout whiskers of mammals such as cats and many rodents are extremely sensitive and enable the animal to detect nearby objects in the dark.

An example of an interoreceptor stimulated by mechanical distortion is the muscle spindle, or stretch receptor (see FIGURE 48.3). This mechanoreceptor monitors the length of skeletal muscles. The muscle spindle contains modified muscle fibers attached to sensory neurons and runs parallel to muscle. When the muscle is stretched, the fibers of the spindle are also stretched, depolarizing the sensory neurons and triggering action potentials that are transmitted back to the spinal cord.

The hair cell is a common type of mechanoreceptor that detects motion. Hair cells are found in the vertebrate ear and in the lateral line organs of fishes and amphibians, where they detect movement relative to the environment (see FIGURE 34.12a). The "hairs" are either specialized cilia or microvilli. They project upward from the surface of the hair cell into either an internal compartment, such as the human inner ear, or an external environment, such as a pond. When the cilia or microvilli bend in one direction, they stretch the hair cell membrane and increase its permeability to sodium and potassium ions, leading to an increase in the rate of impulse production in a sensory neuron. When the cilia bend in the opposite direction, ion permeability decreases, reducing the number of action potentials in the sensory neuron. This specificity allows hair cells to respond to the direction of motion as well as to its strength and speed (FIGURE 49.4).

Pain receptors in humans are a class of naked dendrites in the epidermis of the skin called nociceptors (see FIGURE 49.3). Most animals probably experience pain, although we cannot say what perceptions other animals actually associate with stimulation of their pain receptors. Pain is one of the most important sensations because the stimulus becomes translated into a defensive reaction, such as withdrawal from danger. Rare individuals who are born without any pain sensation may die from such conditions as a ruptured appendix because they cannot feel the associated pain and are unaware of the danger.

Different groups of pain receptors respond to excess heat, pressure, or specific classes of chemicals released from damaged or inflamed tissues. Some of the chemicals that trigger pain include histamine and acids. Prostaglandins increase pain by sensitizing the receptors--that is, lowering their threshold (see Chapter 45 to review prostaglandins). Aspirin and ibuprofen reduce pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

Thermoreceptors, responding to either heat or cold, help regulate body temperature by signaling both surface and body core temperature. There is still debate about the identity of thermoreceptors in the mammalian skin. Possible candidates are two receptors consisting of encapsulated, branched dendrites (see FIGURE 49.3). Many researchers, however, believe that these structures are actually modified pressure receptors and maintain that naked dendrites of certain sensory neurons are the actual thermoreceptors in the skin. There is general agreement that cold and heat receptors in the skin, as well as interothermoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus of the brain, send information to the body's thermostat, located in the posterior hypothalamus.

Chemoreceptors include both general receptors that transmit information about the total solute concentration in a solution and specific receptors that respond to individual kinds of molecules. Osmoreceptors in the mammalian brain, for example, are general receptors that detect changes in the total solute concentration of the blood and stimulate thirst when osmolarity increases (see Chapter 44). Water receptors in the feet of house flies respond to pure water or to a dilute solution of virtually any substance. Most animals also have receptors specific to important molecules, including glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and amino acids. In all these examples, the stimulus molecule binds to a specific site on the membrane of the receptor cell and initiates changes in membrane permeability. Two other groups of chemoreceptors show intermediate specificity. Gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) receptors respond to categories of related chemicals. In taste, humans often classify such general categories as sweet, sour, salty, or bitter. Two of the most sensitive and specific chemoreceptors known are present in the antennae of the male silkworm moth (FIGURE 49.5). They detect the two chemical components of the female moth sex pheromone.

Electromagnetic receptors detect various forms of electromagnetic energy, such as visible light, electricity, and magnetism. Photoreceptors, which detect the radiation we know as visible light, are often organized into eyes. Snakes have extremely sensitive infrared receptors that detect the body heat of prey standing out against a colder background (FIGURE 49.6a). Some fishes discharge electric currents and use special electroreceptors to locate objects, such as prey, that disturb the electric currents. The platypus, a monotreme mammal, has electroreceptors on its bill that can probably detect electrical fields generated by the muscles of prey, such as crustaceans, frogs, and small fishes. There is also evidence that many animals that home or migrate use the magnetic field lines of Earth to help orient themselves (FIGURE 49.6b). The iron-containing mineral magnetite is found in the skulls of some birds and mammals (including humans), in the abdomens of bees, in the teeth of some mollusks, and in certain protists and prokaryotes that orient with respect to Earth's magnetic field. Once used by sailors as a primitive compass, magnetite may be part of an important orienting mechanism in many animals.

In the next few sections, we'll apply our overview of sensory receptors as we take a closer look at specific senses, such as sight and hearing.





 A diversity of photoreceptors has evolved among invertebrates

Most invertebrates have photoreceptors, which range from simple clusters of photoreceptor cells to complex image-forming eyes. One of the simplest is the eye cup of planarians, which provides information about light intensity and direction without actually forming an image. Photoreceptor cells are located within a cup formed by a layer of cells containing a screening pigment that blocks light. Light can enter the cup and stimulate the photoreceptors only through an opening on one side where there is no screening pigment (FIGURE 49.7). The opening of one eye cup faces left and slightly forward, and the opening of the other cup faces right-forward. Thus, light shining from one side of the planarian can enter only the eye cup on that side. The brain compares the rate of nerve impulses coming from the two eye cups, and the animal turns until the sensations from the two cups are equal and minimal. The result is that the animal moves directly away from the light source and reaches a shaded location beneath a rock or some other object, a behavioral adaptation that helps hide the planarian from predators.

Fig 49-7. Eye cups and orientation behavior of a planarian. The brain directs the body to turn until the sensations from the two cups are equal and minimal, causing the animal to move away from light.

Image-forming eyes of two major types have evolved in invertebrates: the compound eye and the single-lens eye. Compound eyes are found in insects and crustaceans (phylum Arthropoda) and some polychaete worms (phylum Annelida). A compound eye consists of up to several thousand light detectors called ommatidia (the "facets" of the eye), each with its own light-focusing lens (FIGURE 49.8). Each ommatidium registers light from a tiny portion of the visual field. Differences in the intensity of light entering the many ommatidia result in a mosaic image. The animal's brain may sharpen the image when it integrates the visual information. The compound eye is extremely acute at detecting movement, an important adaptation for flying insects and small animals constantly threatened with predation. For comparison, consider that the human eye can distinguish light flashes up to about 50 flashes per second. For this reason, the individual images of a movie, which flash at a faster rate, fuse together to create the perception of smooth motion. The compound eyes of some insects, however, recover from excitation rapidly enough to detect the flickering of a light flashing 330 times per second. Such an insect viewing a movie could easily resolve each frame of the film as a separate still image. Insects also have excellent color vision, and some (including bees) can see into the ultraviolet range of the spectrum, which is invisible to us. In studying animal behavior, we cannot extrapolate our sensory world to other species; different animals have different sensitivities and different brain organizations.

(b) The cornea and crystalline cone of each ommatidium function as a lens that focuses light onto the rhabdom, a stack of pigmented plates on the inside of a circle of receptor cells. The rhabdom traps light and guides it to the receptor cells. The image formed by a compound eye is a mosaic of dots formed by the different intensities of light entering the many ommatidia from different angles.

Among the invertebrates, single-lens eyes are found in some jellies, polychaetes, spiders, and many mollusks. A single-lens eye works on a cameralike principle. The eye of an octopus or squid, for example, has a small opening, the pupil, through which light enters. Analogous to a camera's adjustable aperature (F-stop), the iris of a single-lens eye changes the diameter of the pupil; behind the pupil, a single lens focuses light onto the retina, which consists of light-transducing receptor cells. Also similar to a camera's action, muscles move the lens forward or backward to focus images on the retina.





 Vertebrates have single-lens eyes

Similar to the single-lens eyes of many invertebrates, the eyes of vertebrates are also cameralike, but they evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage and differ from the single-lens eyes of invertebrates in several details. The human eye, shown in FIGURE 49.9, is capable of detecting an almost countless variety of colors, forming images of objects miles away, and responding to as little as one photon of light. Remember, however, that it is actually the brain that "sees." Thus, to understand vision we must begin by learning how the vertebrate eye generates sensations (action potentials), and then follow these signals to the visual centers of the brain, where images are perceived.

Fig 49-9. Structure of the vertebrate eye. In this longitudinal section of the eye, the jellylike vitreous humor is illustrated only in the lower half of the eyeball. The mucous membrane, or conjunctiva, surrounding the sclera (the white of the eye) is not shown.

The globe of the vertebrate eye, or eyeball, consists of a tough, white outer layer of connective tissue called the sclera and a thin, pigmented inner layer called the choroid. A delicate layer of epithelial cells forms a mucous membrane, the conjunctiva, that covers the outer surface of the sclera and helps keep the eye moist. At the front of the eye the sclera becomes the transparent cornea, which lets light into the eye and acts as a fixed lens. The conjunctiva does not cover the cornea. The anterior choroid forms the donut-shaped iris, which gives the eye its color. By changing size, the iris regulates the amount of light entering the pupil, the hole in the center of the iris. Just inside the choroid, the retina forms the innermost layer of the eyeball and contains the photoreceptor cells. Information from the photoreceptors leaves the eye at the optic disc, where the optic nerve attaches to the eye. Because there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc, this spot on the lower outside of the retina is a blind spot: Light focused onto that part of the retina is not detected.

The lens and ciliary body divide the eye into two cavities, one between the lens and the cornea, and a much larger cavity behind the lens within the eyeball itself. The ciliary body constantly produces the clear, watery aqueous humor that fills the anterior cavity of the eye. Blockage of the ducts that drain the aqueous humor can produce glaucoma, increased pressure that leads to blindness by compressing the retina. The posterior cavity, filled with the jellylike vitreous humor, constitutes most of the volume of the eye. The aqueous and vitreous humors function as liquid lenses that help focus light onto the retina. The lens itself is a transparent protein disc that focuses an image onto the retina. Like squid and octopuses, many fishes focus by moving the lens forward or backward, as in a camera. Humans and other mammals, however, focus by changing the shape of the lens. When viewing a distant object, the lens is flat. When focusing on a close object, the lens becomes almost spherical, a change called accommodation (FIGURE 49.10).

Fig 49-10. Focusing in the mammalian eye. The lens bends light and focuses it onto the retina. The thicker the lens, the more sharply the light is bent. The lens is nearly spherical when focusing on near objects and much flatter when focusing on distant objects. Ciliary muscles control the shape of the lens. (a) In near vision, the ciliary muscles contract, pulling the border of the choroid layer of the eye toward the lens and causing the suspensory ligaments to relax. With this reduced tension, the elastic lens becomes thicker and rounder. This adjustment of the lens for close vision is known as accommodation. (b) In distance vision, the ciliary muscles relax, allowing the choroid to expand and put tension on the suspensory ligaments. The lens is pulled into a flatter shape.

The human retina contains about 125 million rod cells and 6 million cone cells, two types of photoreceptors named for their shapes. They account for 70%  of all sensory receptors in the body, a fact that underscores the importance of the eyes and visual information in how humans perceive their environment.

Rods and cones have different functions in vision, and the relative numbers of these two photoreceptors in the retina are partly correlated with whether an animal is most active during the day or at night. Rods are more sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors; they enable us to see at night, but only in black and white. Because it takes more light to stimulate cones, these receptors contribute very little to night vision. Cones can distinguish colors in daylight. Color vision is found in all vertebrate classes, though not in all species. Most fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds have strong color vision, but humans and other primates are among the minority of mammals with this ability. Most mammals are nocturnal, and a maximum number of rods in the retina is an adaptation that gives these animals keen night vision. Cats, usually most active at night, have limited color vision and probably see a pastel world during the day. In the human eye, rods are found in greatest density at the peripheral regions of the retina and are completely absent from the fovea, the center of the visual field (see FIGURE 49.9). You cannot see a dim star at night by looking at it directly; if you view it at an angle, however, focusing the starlight onto the regions of the retinas most populated by rods, you will be able to see the star. You achieve your sharpest daylight vision by looking straight at the object of interest because cones are most dense at the fovea, where there are about 150,000 color receptors per mm2. Some birds have more than a million cones per mm2, which enables such species as hawks to spot mice and other small prey from high in the sky. In the retina of the eye, as in all biological structures, variations represent evolutionary adaptations.





 The light-absorbing pigment rhodopsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway

When the vertebrate lens focuses a light image onto the retina, how do the cells of the retina transduce the stimuli into sensations--action potentials that transmit this information about the environment to the brain? Each rod cell or cone cell has an outer segment with a stack of folded membranes, or discs, in which visual pigments are embedded (FIGURE 49.11a, p. 1066). The visual pigments consist of a light-absorbing pigment molecule called retinal (a derivative of vitamin A) bonded to a membrane protein called an opsin. Opsins vary in structure from one type of photoreceptor to another, and the light-absorbing ability of retinal is affected by the specific identity of its opsin partner. Rods contain their own type of opsin, which, combined with retinal, makes up the visual pigment rhodopsin (FIGURE 49.11b).

(b) Rhodopsin, the visual pigment in the disc membrane of rods, consists of the light-absorbing molecule retinal bonded to a specific type of membrane protein, an opsin. The opsin has seven regions of alpha helix that span the disc membrane.

When rhodopsin absorbs light, its retinal component changes shape and separates from opsin. This changes the conformation (shape) of the opsin protein. These light-induced changes in retinal plus opsin are referred to as "bleaching" of rhodopsin. In the dark, enzymes convert the retinal back to its original form, and it recombines with opsin to form rhodopsin (FIGURE 49.12, p. 1066). Bright light keeps the rhodopsin bleached and rods become unresponsive; cones take over. When you walk from a bright environment into a dark place, such as walking into a movie theater in the afternoon, you are initially almost blind to faint light. There is not enough light to stimulate the cones, and it takes at least a few minutes for the bleached rods to become functional again.

Fig 49-12. Effect of light on retinal. Retinal exists in two forms, isomers of each other. Absorption of light converts the pigment from the cis isomer to the trans isomer, which separates from the opsin. This retinal-free opsin triggers the signal-transduction pathway that converts the light signal into an electrochemical signal, a receptor potential, in the rod cell membrane. When the photoreceptor is no longer stimulated by light, enzymes convert the retinal back to the cis form, which recombines with opsin to form rhodopsin.

The light-induced shape-change by opsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway that ultimately results in a receptor potential in the rod cell membrane. First, the altered opsin activates a relay molecule in the signal-transduction pathway, a G protein called transducin, which is also in the disc membrane (FIGURE 49.13). In turn, transducin activates an enzyme that chemically alters the second messenger in the rod cell, a nucleotide called cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).

Fig 49-13. From light reception to receptor potential: A rod cell's signal-transduction pathway. Note that the receptor potential, in this case, is a hyperpolarization of the membrane rather than the more common depolarization.

In the dark, when rhodopsin is inactive, cGMP is bound to sodium ion channels in the rod cell plasma membrane and keeps those channels open. In this state, the rod cell membrane is actually depolarized and releases the neurotransmitter glutamate (see TABLE 48.1) at its synapses with neighboring cells called bipolar cells in the retina (FIGURE 49.14). This steady glutamate release in the dark excites some bipolar cells and inhibits others, depending on what post-synaptic receptor molecules they contain. When light triggers the rhodopsin signal-transduction pathway by altering retinal, an enzyme converts cGMP to GMP, which disengages from the Na+ channels (see FIGURE 49.13). This closes the channels, decreasing the membrane's permeability to Na+ and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. In this case, the cell's receptor potential is a hyperpolarization rather than a depolarization of the membrane. Hyperpolarization slows the rod cell's release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and this causes either excitation or inhibition of postsynaptic bipolar cells, depending on the bipolar cell's type of glutamate receptor (see FIGURE 49.14).

Fig 49-14. The effect of light on synapses between rod cells and bipolar cells. (a) In the dark, rhodopsin is inactive, and the rod cell membrane is highly permeable to sodium and thus depolarized. In this state, the rod cell releases glutamate and regulates the "firing" of two different classes of bipolar cells, which have opposite responses to glutamate. (b) In contrast, when light activates rhodopsin, the rod cell membrane becomes less permeable to sodium, and its membrane potential changes (it develops a receptor potential, a hyperpolarization in this case). The synaptic terminals of the rod cell then slow their release of glutamate, enhancing the activity of one class of bipolar cells and suppressing the activity of the other type.

Color vision involves even more complex signal processing than the rhodopsin mechanism in rods. Color vision results from the presence of three subclasses of cones in the retina, each with its own type of opsin associated with retinal to form visual pigments collectively called photopsins. These photoreceptors are known as red cones, green cones, and blue cones, referring to the colors their kind of photopsin is best at absorbing. The absorption spectra for these pigments overlap, and the brain's perception of intermediate hues depends on the differential stimulation of two or more types of cones. For example, when both red and green cones are stimulated, we may see yellow or orange, depending on which of these two populations of cones is most strongly stimulated. Color blindness, more common in males than females because it is generally inherited as a sex-linked trait (see FIGURE 15.9), is due to a deficiency or absence of one or more types of photopsin.





 The retina assists the cerebral cortex in processing visual information

Processing of visual information begins in the retina itself. Note again that the axons of rods and cones synapse with neurons called bipolar cells, which in turn synapse with ganglion cells (FIGURE 49.15, p. 1068). Additional types of neurons in the retina, horizontal cells and amacrine cells, help integrate the information before it is sent to the brain. The axons of ganglion cells then convey the resulting sensations to the brain as action potentials along the optic nerve.

Fig 49-15. The vertebrate retina. Light must pass through several relatively transparent layers of cells before reaching the rods and cones. These photoreceptors communicate with ganglion cells via bipolar cells. The axons of the ganglion cells transmit the visual sensations (action potentials) to the brain. There is not a one-to-one relationship among the rods and cones, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells; each bipolar cell receives information from several rods or cones, and each ganglion cell from several bipolar cells. The horizontal and amacrine cells carry information across the retina to integrate the signals. All the rods or cones that feed information to one ganglion cell form the receptive field for that cell. The larger the receptive field (the more rods or cones that supply a ganglion cell), the less sharp the image, because it is less evident exactly where the light struck the retina. The ganglion cells of the fovea have very small receptive fields, so visual acuity is very sharp in this area. Black arrows indicate the pathway of visual information (action potentials) from the retina to the optic nerve.

Signals from the rods and cones may follow either vertical or lateral pathways. In the so-called vertical pathway, information passes directly from the receptor cells to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. In the lateral pathway, the horizontal and amacrine cells provide lateral integration of visual signals. Horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptor cells and to several bipolar cells; amacrine cells spread the information from one bipolar cell to several ganglion cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant receptors and bipolar cells that are not illuminated, making the light spot appear lighter and the dark surroundings even darker. This integration, called lateral inhibition, sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the image. Lateral inhibition is repeated by the interactions of the amacrine cells with the ganglion cells and occurs at all levels of visual processing.

Axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerves that transmit sensations from the eyes to the brain. The optic nerves from the two eyes meet at the optic chiasm near the center of the base of the cerebral cortex (FIGURE 49.16). The nerve tracts of the optic chiasm are arranged in such a way that visual sensations from the left visual field of both eyes are transmitted to the right side of the brain, and visual sensations in the right visual field are transmitted to the left side of the brain. Most of the ganglion cell axons lead to the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus. Neurons of the lateral geniculate nuclei continue back to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the cerebrum. Additional interneurons carry the information to other, more sophisticated visual processing and integrating centers elsewhere in the cortex.

Fig 49-16. Neural pathways for vision. Because of the arrangement of neurons in the retinas, optic nerves, and optic chiasm, the right side of the brain receives sensory information about objects in the left visual field (blue), while the left side of the brain receives information from the right visual field (red). Each optic nerve contains about a million axons that synapse with interneurons in the lateral geniculate nuclei. The nuclei relay sensations to the visual cortex, believed to be the first of many brain centers that cooperate in constructing our visual perceptions.

Point-by-point information in the visual field is projected along neurons onto the visual cortex according to its position in the retina, but the information the brain receives is highly distorted. How does the brain convert a complex set of action potentials representing two-dimensional images projected onto our retinas into three-dimensional perceptions of our surroundings? Researchers estimate that at least 30%  of the cerebral cortex--hundreds of millions of interneurons in perhaps dozens of integrating centers--take part in formulating what we actually "see." Determining how these centers integrate such components of our vision as color, motion, depth, shape, and detail is the focus of an exciting, fast-moving research effort.





 The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear

The mammalian ear can be divided into three regions. The outer ear consists of the external pinna and the auditory canal, which collect sound waves and channel them to the tympanic membrane (eardrum) separating the outer ear from the middle ear. Within the middle ear, vibrations are conducted through three ossicles (small bones)--the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup)--to the inner ear, passing through the oval window, a membrane beneath the stapes (FIGURE 49.17a and b, p. 1070). The middle ear also opens into the Eustachian tube, which connects with the pharynx and equalizes pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere, enabling you to "pop" your ears when changing altitude, for example. The inner ear consists of a labyrinth of channels within a skull bone (the temporal bone). These channels are lined by a membrane and contain fluid that moves in response to sound or movement of the head.

Fig 49-17. Structure and function of the human ear.

The part of the inner ear involved in hearing is a coiled organ known as the cochlea (Latin, "snail"). The cochlea has two large chambers, an upper vestibular canal and a lower tympanic canal, separated by a smaller cochlear duct (FIGURE 49.17c). The vestibular and tympanic canals contain a fluid called perilymph, and the cochlear duct is filled with a liquid called endolymph. The floor of the cochlear duct, the basilar membrane, bears the organ of Corti, which contains the actual receptor cells of the ear, hair cells with hairs projecting into the cochlear duct (FIGURE 49.17d). Many of the hairs are attached to the tectorial membrane, which hangs over the organ of Corti like a shelf.

How is the anatomy of the ear correlated with the function of hearing? The ear converts the energy of pressure waves traveling through air into nerve impulses that the brain perceives as sound. Vibrating objects, such as the reverberating strings of a guitar or the vocal cords of a speaking person, create percussion waves in the surrounding air. These waves cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate with the same frequency as the sound. The three bones of the middle ear transmit the mechanical movements to the oval window, a membrane on the surface of the cochlea. Vibrations of the oval window produce pressure waves in the fluid within the cochlea.

The cochlea transduces the energy of the vibrating fluid into action potentials. The stapes vibrating against the oval window creates a traveling pressure wave in the fluid of the cochlea that passes into the vestibular canal (FIGURE 49.18a, p. 1071). This wave continues around the tip of the cochlea and through the tympanic canal, dissipating as it strikes the round window. The pressure waves in the vestibular canal push downward on the cochlear duct and basilar membrane. The basilar membrane vibrates up and down in response to the pressure waves, and its hair cells alternately brush against and are withdrawn from the tectorial membrane. Deflection of the hairs opens ion channels in the plasma membrane of the hair cells, and positive ions (K+, in this case) enter. The resulting depolarization increases neurotransmitter release from the hair cell and the frequency of action potentials in the sensory neuron with which the hair cell synapses. This neuron carries the sensations to the brain through the auditory nerve.

Fig 49-18. How the cochlea distinguishes pitch. (a) Vibrations of the stapes against the oval window agitate the fluid within the cochlea (uncoiled here), causing pressure waves having a frequency equivalent to the sound waves that entered the ear. The waves (black arrows) pass through the vestibular canal to the apex of the conchlea then back toward the base of the cochlea via the tympanic canal. The energy causes the cochlear duct, with its basilar membrane and organ of Corti, to vibrate up and down. The bouncing of the basilar membrane stimulates the hair cells within the cochlear duct. (b) Fibers span the width of the basilar membrane. Like harp strings, these fibers vary in length, being shorter near the base of the membrane and longer near its apex. The length of the fibers "tunes" specific regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate at specific frequencies. (c) Different frequencies of pressure waves in the cochlea cause certain places along the basilar membrane to vibrate, stimulating particular hair cells and sensory neurons. The differential stimulation of hair cells is perceived in the brain as sound of a certain pitch.

Sound is detected by increases in the frequency of impulses in the sensory neuron, but how is the quality of that sound determined? Two important sound variables are volume and pitch. Volume (loudness) is determined by the amplitude, or height, of the sound wave. The greater the amplitude of a sound, the more vigorous the vibrations of fluid in the cochlea, the greater the bending of the hair cells, and the more action potentials generated in the sensory neurons. Pitch is a function of a sound wave's frequency, or number of vibrations per second, expressed in hertz (Hz). Short, high-frequency waves produce high-pitched sound, while long, low-frequency waves generate low-pitched sound. Healthy young humans can hear sounds in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, dogs can hear sounds as high as 40,000 Hz, and bats can emit and hear clicking sounds of even higher frequency, using this ability to locate objects by sonar.

Pitch can be distinguished by the cochlea because the basilar membrane is not uniform along its length (see FIGURE 49.18b and c). The proximal end near the oval window is relatively narrow and stiff, while the distal end near the tip is wider and more flexible. Each region of the basilar membrane is most affected by a particular vibration frequency. The sensory neurons associated with the region vibrating most vigorously at any instant send the most action potentials along the auditory nerve. But the actual perception of pitch depends on neural mapping of the brain. Sensory neurons from the auditory pathway project onto specific auditory areas of the cerebral cortex according to the region of the basilar membrane in which the signal originated. When a particular site of the cortex is stimulated, we perceive a sound of a particular pitch.





 The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium

Several organs in the inner ear of humans and most other mammals detect body position and balance. Behind the oval window is a vestibule that contains two chambers, the utricle and saccule. The utricle opens into three semicircular canals that complete the apparatus for equilibrium (FIGURE 49.19a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-19. Organs of balance in the inner ear. (a) Three structures of the inner ear--the utricle and saccule in the vestibule and the semicircular canals--contain hair cells sensitive to balance and body position. The saccule and utricle tell the brain which way is up and also inform it of the body's fixed position in space or of any linear acceleration associated with movement. The semicircular canals are arranged in the three spatial planes. (b) Each canal has at its base a swelling called an ampulla, which contains a cluster of hair cells with hairs projecting into a gelatinous cap called the cupula. (c) When the head changes its rate of rotation, inertia prevents the endolymph in the semicircular canals from moving with the head, so the fluid presses against the cupula, bending the hair cells. The bending increases the frequency of action potentials in the sensory neurons in direct proportion to the amount of rotational acceleration. The mechanism adjusts quickly if rotation continues at a constant speed: The endolymph begins moving with the head, and the pressure on the cupula is reduced. If rotation stops suddenly, however, the fluid continues to flow through the semicircular canals and again stimulates the hair cells. This new stimulus can cause dizziness.

Sensations related to body position are generated much like sensations of sound in humans and most other mammals. Hair cells in the utricle and saccule respond to changes in head position with respect to gravity and movement in one direction. The hair cells are arranged in clusters, and all the hairs project into a gelatinous material containing many small calcium carbonate particles called otoliths ("ear stones"). Because this material is heavier than the endolymph within the utricle and saccule, gravity is always pulling downward on the hairs of the receptor cells, sending a constant series of action potentials along the sensory neurons of the vestibular branch of the auditory nerve.

Different body angles cause different hair cells and their sensory neurons to be stimulated. When the position of the head changes with respect to gravity (as when the head bends forward), the force on the hair cell changes, and it increases (or decreases--see FIGURE 49.4) its output of neurotransmitter. The brain interprets the resulting changes in impulse production by the sensory neurons to determine the position of the head. By a similar mechanism, the semicircular canals, arranged in the three spatial planes, detect changes in the rate of rotation or angular movements of the head (FIGURE 49.19b and c).





 A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians

Like other vertebrates, fishes and aquatic amphibians also have inner ears located near the brain. There is no cochlea, but there are a saccule, a utricle, and semicircular canals, structures homologous to the equilibrium sensors of our own ears. Within these chambers in the inner ear of a fish, sensory hairs are stimulated by the movement of otoliths. Unlike the mammalian hearing apparatus, the ear of a fish has no eardrum and does not open to the outside of the body. Vibrations of the water caused by sound waves are conducted through the skeleton of the head to the inner ears, setting the otoliths in motion and stimulating the hair cells. The air-filled swim bladder (see Chapter 34) also vibrates in response to sound and may contribute to the transfer of sound to the inner ear. Some fishes, including catfishes and minnows, have a series of bones called the Weberian apparatus, which conducts vibrations from the swim bladder to the inner ear.

Most fishes and aquatic amphibians also have a lateral line system along both sides of the body (FIGURE 49.20). The system contains mechanoreceptors that detect low-frequency waves by a mechanism similar to the function of the inner ear. Water from the animal's surroundings enters the lateral line system through numerous pores and flows along a tube past the mechanoreceptors. The receptor units, called neuromasts, resemble the ampullae in our semicircular canals. Each neuromast has a cluster of hair cells, with the sensory hairs embedded in a gelatinous cap, the cupula. As the pressure of moving water bends a cupula, the hair cells transduce the energy into receptor potentials and then into action potentials that are transmitted along a nerve to the brain. This information helps the fish perceive its movement through water or the direction and velocity of water currents flowing over its body. The lateral line system also detects water movements or vibrations generated by other moving objects, including prey and predators.

Fig 49-20. The lateral line system in a fish. Water flowing through the system bends hair cells. The hair cells transduce the energy into receptor potentials, triggering action potentials, which are conveyed to the brain. The lateral line system enables a fish to monitor water currents, pressure waves produced by moving objects, and low-frequency sounds conducted through water.

The lateral line system functions only in water. In terrestrial vertebrates, the inner ear has evolved as the main organ of hearing and equilibrium. Some amphibians have a lateral line system as tadpoles, but not as adults living on land. In the ear of a terrestrial frog or toad, sound vibrations traveling in the air are conducted to the inner ear by a tympanic membrane on the body surface and a single middle ear bone. There also is evidence that the lungs of a frog vibrate in response to sound and transmit their vibrations to the eardrum via the auditory tube. A small side pocket of the saccule functions as the main hearing organ of the frog, and it is this outgrowth of the saccule that gave rise to the more elaborate cochlea during the evolution of mammals. Birds also have a cochlea, but like amphibians and reptiles, sound is conducted from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear by a single bone, the stapes.





 Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive

Most invertebrates have sensory organs called statocysts that contain mechanoreceptors and function in their sense of equilibrium (FIGURE 49.21). A common type of statocyst has a layer of hair cells surrounding a chamber containing statoliths, which are grains of sand or other dense granules. Gravity causes the statoliths to settle to the low point within the chamber, stimulating hair cells in that location. This is similar to how the saccule and utricle function in vertebrates, and indeed these structures in the vertebrate inner ear are considered to be specialized types of statocysts. The statocysts of invertebrates have various locations. For example, many jellies have statocysts at the fringe of the "bell," giving the animals an indication of body position. Lobsters and crayfish have statocysts near the bases of their antennules. Crayfish have been tricked into swimming upside down in experiments in which the statoliths were replaced with metal shavings that could be pulled to the upper end of the statocysts with magnets.

Fig 49-21. The statocyst of an invertebrate. The settling of statoliths to the low point within the chamber bends cilia on receptor cells in that location, providing the brain with information about the position of the body.

Many invertebrates demonstrate a general sensitivity to sound, although structures specialized for hearing seem to be less widespread than gravity sensors. Hearing structures have been most extensively studied in terrestrial insects.

Many (perhaps most) insects have body hairs that vibrate in response to sound waves. Hairs of different stiffness and length vibrate at different frequencies. The hairs are commonly tuned to frequencies of sounds produced by other organisms. A male mosquito locates a mate by means of fine hairs on his antennae. The hairs vibrate in a specific way in response to the hum produced by the beating wings of flying females. A tuning fork that vibrates at the same frequency as a female mosquito's wings will also attract males. Some caterpillars (larval moths and butterflies) have vibrating body hairs that detect the buzzing wings of predatory wasps, warning the caterpillars of danger. Many insects also have localized "ears" (FIGURE 49.22). A tympanic membrane (eardrum) is stretched over an internal air chamber. Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane, stimulating receptor cells attached to the inside of the membrane and resulting in nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain. Some moths can hear notes of such high pitch that they detect the sounds bats produce for sonar, and perception of these sounds triggers the moth's escape maneuver, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.

 Perceptions of taste and smell are usually interrelated

The perceptions of taste and smell both depend on chemoreceptors that detect specific chemicals in the environment. In the case of terrestrial animals, taste is the detection of certain chemicals that are present in a solution, and smell is the detection of airborne chemicals. However, these chemical senses are usually closely related, and there really is no distinction in aquatic environments.

The taste receptors of insects are located within sensory hairs called sensillae on the feet and mouthparts. The animals use their sense of taste to select food. A tasting hair contains several chemoreceptor cells, each especially responsive to a particular class of chemical stimuli, such as sugar or salt. By integrating sensations (nerve impulses) from these different receptor cells, the insect's brain can apparently distinguish a very large number of tastes (FIGURE 49.23). Insects can also smell airborne chemicals, using olfactory sensillae, usually located on the antennae (see FIGURE 49.5).

Fig 49-23. The mechanism of taste in a blowfly. (a) Gustatory sensillae (hairs) on the feet and mouthparts each contain four chemoreceptor cells with dendrites that extend to the pore at the tip of the sensory hair. (b) Each chemoreceptor (taste) cell is especially sensitive to a particular class of substance; for example, the receptor colored green here is most responsive to sugars. But this specificity is relative; each cell can respond to some extent to a broad range of chemical stimuli. Thus, any natural food probably stimulates two or more of the receptor cells. The brain apparently integrates the frequencies of impulses arriving along the axons of the four classes of receptor cells and distinguishes a great variety of tastes.

In humans and other mammals, the senses of taste and smell are functionally similar and interrelated. In both cases a small molecule must dissolve in liquid to reach the receptor cell and trigger the sensation. That molecule binds to a specific protein in the receptor cell membrane, triggering a depolarization of the membrane and the release of neurotransmitter (see FIGURE 49.2).

The receptor cells for taste are modified epithelial cells organized into taste buds scattered in several areas of the tongue and mouth. Most of the taste buds are on the surface of the tongue or are associated with nipplelike projections called papillae on the tongue. Although we cannot distinguish different types of taste receptors from their structures, we recognize four basic taste perceptions--sweet, sour, salty, and bitter--each detected by a chemoreceptor with a certain receptor and signal-transduction pathway. Although each receptor cell is more responsive to a particular type of substance, it can actually be stimulated by a broad range of chemicals. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain integrates the differential input from the taste buds, and a complex flavor is perceived.

The olfactory sense of mammals detects certain airborne chemicals. Olfactory receptor cells are neurons that line the upper portion of the nasal cavity and send impulses along their axons directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain (FIGURE 49.24). The receptive ends of the cells contain cilia that extend into the layer of mucus coating the nasal cavity. When an odorous substance diffuses into this region, it binds to specific receptor molecules on the plasma membrane of the olfactory cilia. The binding triggers a signal-transduction pathway involving a G-protein-signaling pathway and, in many cases, the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and the second messenger cyclic AMP (see FIGURE 11.13). The second messenger opens Na+ channels in the olfactory receptor cell membrane, depolarizing it and generating action potentials that go to the brain. Humans can distinguish thousands of different odors, but these are probably based on a few primary odors, analogous to the basic tastes of the gustatory system.

Fig 49-24. Olfaction in humans. The specific binding of molecules (blue dots) to specific receptor molecules in the plasma membrane of chemoreceptor cells triggers action potentials. Action potentials are conveyed to neurons in the olfactory bulb of the brain by axons of the receptor cells.

Although the receptors and brain pathways for taste and olfaction are independent, the two senses do interact. Indeed, much of what we call taste is really smell. If the olfactory system is blocked, as by a head cold, the perception of taste is sharply reduced.

Throughout our discussions of sensory mechanisms we have seen many examples of how sensory inputs to the nervous system result in the specific body movements that we observe as animal behavior. The swimming of planarians away from light, the escape behavior of a moth that hears bat sonar, the "righting" response of a crayfish turned upside-down, and the feeding movements of a hydra when it tastes glutathione--these are just a few cases that we have mentioned so far. Animal behavior flows in a seamless cycle involving continuous brain operations that generate actions, note the consequences of these actions via sensory mechanisms, and then use this information to decide on the next action. The remainder of the chapter focuses on the motor mechanisms that make these animal responses possible: how animals use their muscles and skeletons to move.





 Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity

The modes of animal locomotion are diverse. Most animal phyla include species that swim. On land and in the sediments on the floor of the sea and lakes, animals crawl, walk, run, or hop. Active flight (in contrast to gliding downward from a tree or elevated ground) has evolved in only a few animal groups: insects, reptiles, birds, and, among the mammals, bats. A large group of flying reptiles died out millions of years ago, leaving birds and bats as the only flying vertebrates.

In all its forms, locomotion requires that an animal expend energy to overcome two forces that tend to keep it stationary: friction and gravity. Exerting force requires energy-consuming cellular work. Thus, the study of locomotion returns us to the theme of animal bioenergetics. The energetic cost of transport is different for the various modes of locomotion in different environments. FIGURE 49.25 compares these costs for swimming, running, and flying. Running animals generally consume more energy per meter traveled than equivalently sized animals specialized for swimming, partly because to run (or walk), an animal must expend energy to overcome gravity. Swimming is the most efficient mode of transport (assuming, of course, that an animal is specialized for swimming). If we were to compare energy consumption per minute rather than per meter, we would find that flying animals use more energy than animals swimming or walking for the same amount of time. Each line on the graph in FIGURE 49.25 also shows that a larger animal travels more efficiently than a smaller species specialized for the same mode of transport. For example, a horse consumes less energy per kilogram of body weight than a cat running the same distance. (Of course, total energy consumption is greater for the larger animal.)

Fig 49-25. The cost of transport. This graph compares the transport cost, in joules per kilogram of body weight per meter traveled, for animals specialized for swimming, flying, and running (1 J = 0.24 cal). Notice that both axes are plotted on logarithmic scales.

Swimming

Because most animals are reasonably buoyant in water, overcoming gravity is less of a problem for swimming animals than for species that move on land or through the air. On the other hand, water is a much denser medium than air, and thus the problem of resistance (friction) is a major one for aquatic animals. A sleek, fusiform (torpedolike) shape is a common adaptation of fast swimmers (see FIGURE 40.6), and swimming tends to be the most energy-efficient means of locomotion.

Animals swim in diverse ways. For instance, many insects and four-legged vertebrates use their legs as oars to push against the water. Squid, scallops, and some cnidarians are jet-propelled, taking in water and squirting it out in bursts. Fishes swim by moving their body and tail from side to side. Whales and other aquatic mammals move by undulating their body and tail up and down.

Locomotion on Land

In general, the problems of locomotion on land are the opposite of those in water. On land, a walking, running, hopping, or crawling animal must be able to support itself and move against gravity, but, at least at moderate speeds, air poses relatively little resistance. When a land animal walks, runs, or hops, its leg muscles expend energy both to propel it and to keep it from falling down. With each step, the animal's leg muscles must also overcome inertia by accelerating a leg from a standing start. For moving on land, powerful muscles and strong skeletal support are more important than a streamlined shape.

Diverse adaptations for traveling on land have evolved in various vertebrates. For example, traveling mainly by hopping, kangaroos have large muscles that generate a lot of power in their hind legs (FIGURE 49.26). When a kangaroo lands, tendons in its hind legs momentarily store energy. The higher the animal hops, the more energy the tendons store. Analogous to the tension of a spring on a pogo stick, the stored energy is available for the next jump and is a cost-free energy boost that reduces the total amount of energy the animal must expend to travel. The pogo stick analogy applies to many land animals; the legs of an insect, a dog, or a human, for instance, retain some spring when walking or running, although considerably less than those of a hopping kangaroo.

Fig 49-26. Energy-efficient locomotion on land. Members of the kangaroo family travel from place to place mainly by leaping forward on their large hind legs. Kinetic energy momentarily stored in tendons after each leap provides a cost-free boost for the next leap. In fact, a large kangaroo hopping along at 30 km/h uses no more energy per minute than it does at 6 km/h. The large tail helps balance the animal's body during leaps and while sitting on the ground.

Maintaining balance is another prerequisite for walking, running, or hopping. A kangaroo's large tail helps balance its body during leaps and also forms a stable tripod with its hind legs when sitting or moving slowly. Illustrating the same principle, a walking cat, dog, or horse keeps three feet on the ground. Bipedal animals, such as humans and birds, keep part of at least one foot on the ground when walking. When running, all four feet (or both feet for bipeds) may be off the ground momentarily, but at running speeds, it is momentum more than foot contact that keeps the body upright.

Crawling poses a very different situation. Because much of its body is in contact with the ground, a crawling animal must exert considerable effort to overcome friction. Earthworms crawl by peristalsis, a type of locomotion dependent on a hydrostatic skeleton, which we examine later. Many snakes crawl by undulating the entire body from side to side. Assisted by large, movable scales on the underside, a snake's body pushes against the ground, driving the animal forward. Boa constrictors and pythons creep straight forward, driven by muscles that lift their belly scales off the ground, tilt the scales forward, and then push them backward against the ground.

Flying

Gravity poses a major problem for a flying animal. For an animal to become airborne, its wings must develop enough lift to overcome the downward force of gravity. The key to flight is the shape of the wings. All types of wings, including those of airplanes, are airfoils--structures whose shape alters air currents in a way that creates lift (see FIGURE 34.26).

Cellular and Skeletal Underpinnings of Locomotion

Underlying the diverse forms of locomotion are fundamental mechanisms common to all animals. At the cellular level, all animal movement is based on one of two basic contractile systems, both of which consume energy to move protein strands against one another. These two systems of cell motility--microtubules and microfilaments--were discussed in Chapter 7. Microtubules are responsible for the beating of cilia and the undulations of flagella. Microfilaments play a major role in amoeboid movement, and they are also the contractile elements of muscle cells. It is the contraction of muscles that concerns us in this chapter, but the work of a muscle in itself cannot translate into movement of the animal. Swimming, crawling, running, hopping, and flying all result from muscles working against some type of skeleton.





 Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement

The three functions of a skeleton are support, protection, and movement. Most land animals would sag from their own weight if they had no skeleton to support them. Even an animal living in water would be a formless mass with no framework to maintain its shape. Many animals have hard skeletons that protect soft tissues. For example, the vertebrate skull protects the brain, and the ribs form a cage around the heart, lungs, and other internal organs. And skeletons aid in movement by giving muscles something firm to work against. There are three main types of skeletons: hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons.

Hydrostatic Skeletons

A hydrostatic skeleton consists of fluid held under pressure in a closed body compartment. This is the main type of skeleton in most cnidarians, flatworms, nematodes, and annelids (see Chapter 33). These animals control their form and movement by using muscles to change the shape of the fluid-filled compartments. Among the cnidarians, for example, a hydra can elongate by closing its mouth and using contractile cells in the body wall to constrict the central gastrovascular cavity. Because water cannot be compressed very much, decreasing the diameter of the cavity forces it to increase in length. In flatworms (planarians), the interstitial fluid is kept under pressure and functions as the main hydrostatic skeleton. Planarian movement results mainly from muscles in the body wall exerting localized forces against the hydrostatic skeleton. Roundworms (nematodes) hold the fluid in the body cavity (a pseudocoelom; see FIGURE 32.6b) at a high pressure, and contractions of longitudinal muscles result in thrashing movements. In earthworms and other annelids, the coelomic fluid functions as a hydrostatic skeleton. The coelomic cavity is divided by septa between the segments of the worm, and thus the animal can change the shape of each segment individually, using both circular and longitudinal muscles. The hydrostatic skeleton enables earthworms and most other annelids to move by peristalsis, a type of locomotion produced by rhythmic waves of muscle contractions passing from head to tail (FIGURE 49.27, p. 1078).

Hydrostatic skeletons are well suited for life in aquatic environments. They may cushion internal organs from shocks and provide support for crawling and burrowing. However, a hydrostatic skeleton cannot support the forms of terrestrial locomotion in which an animal's body is held off the ground, such as walking or running.

Exoskeletons

An exoskeleton is a hard encasement deposited on the surface of an animal. For example, most mollusks are enclosed in calcareous (calcium carbonate) shells secreted by the mantle, a sheetlike extension of the body wall (see FIGURE 33.16). As the animal grows, it enlarges the diameter of the shell by adding to its outer edge. Clams and other bivalves close their hinged shells using muscles attached to the inside of this exoskeleton.

The jointed exoskeleton typical of arthropods is a cuticle, a nonliving coat secreted by the epidermis. Muscles are attached to knobs and plates of the cuticle that extend into the interior of the body. About 30-50%  of the cuticle consists of chitin, a polysaccharide similar to cellulose. Fibrils of chitin are embedded in a matrix made of protein, forming a composite material that combines strength and flexibility. Where protection is most important, the cuticle is hardened with organic compounds that cross-link the proteins of the exoskeleton. Some crustaceans, such as lobsters, harden portions of their exoskeletons even more by adding calcium salts. In contrast, at the joints of the legs, where the cuticle must be thin and flexible, there is only a small amount of inorganic salts and little cross-linking of proteins. The exoskeleton of an arthropod must periodically be shed (molted) and replaced by a larger case with each spurt of growth by the animal (see FIGURE 5.9).

Endoskeletons

An endoskeleton consists of hard supporting elements, such as bones, buried within the soft tissues of an animal. Sponges are reinforced by hard spicules consisting of inorganic material or by softer fibers made of protein (see FIGURE 33.3). Echinoderms have an endoskeleton of hard plates beneath the skin. These ossicles are composed of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate crystals, and the separate plates are usually bound together by protein fibers. Sea urchins have a skeleton of tightly bound ossicles, but the ossicles of sea stars are more loosely bound, allowing the animal to change the shape of its arms (see FIGURE 33.38).

Chordates have endoskeletons consisting of cartilage, bone, or some combination of these materials (see FIGURE 40.2). The mammalian skeleton is built from more than 200 bones, some fused together and others connected at joints by ligaments that allow freedom of movement (FIGURE 49.28). Anatomists divide the vertebrate frame into an axial skeleton, consisting of the skull, vertebral column (backbone), and rib cage, and an appendicular skeleton, made up of limb bones and the pectoral and pelvic girdles that anchor the appendages to the axial skeleton. In each appendage, several types of joints provide flexibility for body movement and locomotion.

(b) Joints allow great flexibility in body movement, indicated by arrows. Hinge and pivot joints between bones in our wrists and hands enable us to make precise manipulations.





 Physical support on land depends on adaptations of body proportions and posture

An engineer designing a bridge or tall building must take into account the effects of changes in size, or scale. An increase in size from a small-scale model to the real thing has a significant effect on building design. Physical laws dictate that the strength of a building support depends on its cross-sectional area, which increases as the square of its diameter. In sharp contrast, the strain on the supports depends on the building's weight, which increases as the cube of its height or other linear dimension. In common with a bridge or a building, an animal's body "design" must account for the greater demand for support that comes with increasing size. Consistent with physical laws, a large animal, such as an elephant, has very different body proportions than a small animal, such as a mouse. Imagine a mouse, with its very slender legs, scaled up to elephant size. If the imaginary animal kept its mouselike body proportions, its legs would buckle under its weight.

In simply applying the building analogy, we might predict the size of an elephant's leg bones to be directly proportional to the strain imposed by its body weight. However, our prediction would be inaccurate; an animal's body is complex and nonrigid, and the building analogy only partly explains the relationship between animal body design and support. The size of an animal's legs relative to its body size is only part of the story. It turns out that body posture--the position of the legs relative to the main body--is a more important structural feature in supporting body weight, at least in mammals and birds (FIGURE 49.29). Muscles and tendons (connective tissue joining muscles to bones), which hold the legs of elephants, coyotes, humans, and other large mammals relatively straight and under the body, bear most of the load.

 Muscles move skeletal parts by contracting

As we mentioned earlier, animal movement is based on the contraction of muscles working against some type of skeleton. The action of a muscle is always to contract; muscles can extend only passively.

The ability to move parts of the body in opposite directions requires that muscles be attached to the skeleton in antagonistic pairs, each muscle working against the other (FIGURE 49.30). We flex our arm, for instance, by contracting the biceps, with the hinged joint of the elbow acting as the fulcrum of a lever. To extend the arm, we relax the biceps while the triceps on the opposite side contracts. But how does a muscle actually contract? As always, the key to function is structure. In this section we will examine the structure and mechanism of contraction of vertebrate skeletal muscle and then compare this basic pattern with other types of muscle.

Fig 49-30. The cooperation of muscles and skeletons in movement. Muscles actively contract, but they elongate only when passively stretched. Back-and-forth movement is generally accomplished by antagonistic muscles, each working against the other. This arrangement works with either an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. (a) In humans, contraction of the biceps muscle, represented by red in the bottom diagram, raises (flexes) the forearm. Contraction of the triceps muscle (green) lowers (extends) the forearm. (b) Although arthropod muscles are positioned differently and housed within an exoskeleton, the antagonistic action of flexors and extensors is similar to that of a vertebrate. When the flexor muscle (red) in the upper part of a grasshopper's leg contracts, the lower leg is pulled toward the body. In this position the grasshopper is sitting, poised for a jump, as shown here. Alternatively, when the extensor muscle (green) in its upper leg contracts, the leg jerks backward, sending the insect into the air.

Structure and Function of Vertebrate Skeletal Muscle

Vertebrate skeletal muscle, which is attached to the bones and is responsible for their movement, is characterized by a hierarchy of smaller and smaller parallel units (FIGURE 49.31). A skeletal muscle consists of a bundle of long fibers running the length of the muscle. Each fiber is a single cell with many nuclei, reflecting its formation by the fusion of many embryonic cells. Each fiber is itself a bundle of smaller myofibrils arranged longitudinally. The myofibrils, in turn, are composed of two kinds of myofilaments. Thin filaments consist of two strands of actin and one strand of regulatory protein coiled around one another, while thick filaments are staggered arrays of myosin molecules.

Fig 49-31. The structure of skeletal muscle.

Skeletal muscle is also called striated muscle because the regular arrangement of the myofilaments creates a repeating pattern of light and dark bands. Each repeating unit is a sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of the muscle. The borders of the sarcomere, the Z lines, are lined up in adjacent myofibrils and contribute to the striations visible with a light microscope. The thin filaments are attached to the Z lines and project toward the center of the sarcomere, while the thick filaments are centered in the sarcomere. At rest, the thick and thin filaments do not overlap completely, and the area near the edge of the sarcomere where there are only thin filaments is called the I band. The A band is the broad region that corresponds to the length of the thick filaments. The thin filaments do not extend completely across the sarcomere, so the H zone in the center of the A band contains only thick filaments. This arrangement of thick and thin filaments is the key to how the sarcomere, and hence the whole muscle, contracts.





 Interactions between myosin and actin generate force during muscle contractions

When a muscle contracts, the length of each sarcomere is reduced; that is, the distance from one Z line to the next becomes shorter. In the contracted sarcomere, the A bands do not change in length, but the I bands shorten and the H zone disappears (FIGURE 49.32). These changes can be explained by the sliding-filament model of muscle contraction. According to this model, neither the thin filaments nor the thick filaments change in length when the muscle contracts; rather, the filaments slide past each other longitudinally, so that the degree of overlap of the thin and thick filaments increases. If the region of overlap increases, both the length occupied only by thin filaments (the I band) and the length occupied only by thick filaments (the H zone) must decrease.

Fig 49-32. The sliding-filament model of muscle contraction. As seen in these transmission electron micrographs, the lengths of the thick (myosin) filaments (purple) and thin (actin) filaments (orange) remain the same as contraction occurs. (a) In a relaxed muscle, the length of each sarcomere is greater than in a contracting or contracted muscle. (b) During contraction, thick and thin filaments slide past each other, shortening the sarcomere. (c) When the muscle is fully contracted, the sarcomere is markedly shortened; the thin filaments overlap, and there is little or no space between the ends of the thick filaments and the Z lines.

The sliding of the filaments is based on the interaction of the actin and myosin molecules that make up the thin and thick filaments. Myosin consists of a long, fibrous "tail" region, with a globular "head" region sticking off to the side. The tail is where the individual myosin molecules cohere to form the thick filament. The myosin head is the center of bioenergetic reactions that power muscle contractions. It can bind ATP and hydrolyze it into ADP and inorganic phosphate. Some of the energy released by cleaving the ATP is transferred to the myosin, which changes shape to a high-energy configuration (FIGURE 49.33). This energized myosin binds to a specific site on actin, forming a cross-bridge. The stored energy is released, and the myosin head relaxes to its low-energy configuration. This relaxation changes the angle of attachment of the myosin head to the myosin tail. According to this hypothesis, as the myosin bends inward on itself, it exerts tension on the thin filament to which it is bound, pulling the thin filament toward the center of the sarcomere. The bond between the low-energy myosin and actin is broken when a new molecule of ATP binds to the myosin head. In a repeating cycle, the free head can then cleave the new ATP to revert to the high-energy configuration and attach to a new binding site on another actin molecule farther along the thin filament. Each of the approximately 350 heads of a thick filament forms and re-forms about five cross-bridges per second, driving filaments past each other.

Fig 49-33. One hypothesis for how myosin-actin interactions generate the force for muscle contraction.

A muscle cell typically stores only enough ATP for a few contractions. Muscle cells also store glycogen between the myofibrils, but most of the energy needed for repetitive muscle contraction is stored in substances called phosphagens. Creatine phosphate, the phosphagen of vertebrates, can supply a phosphate group to ADP to make ATP.





 Calcium ions and regulatory proteins control muscle contraction

A skeletal muscle contracts only when stimulated by a motor neuron. When the muscle is at rest, the myosin binding sites on the actin molecules are blocked by the regulatory protein tropomyosin. Another set of regulatory proteins, the troponin complex, controls the position of tropomyosin on the thin filament (FIGURE 49.34). For a muscle cell to contract, the myosin binding sites on the actin must be uncovered. This occurs when calcium ions bind to troponin, altering the interaction between troponin and tropomyosin. The Ca2+ binding rearranges the tropomyosin-troponin complex, exposing the myosin binding sites on actin. When calcium is present, the sliding of thin and thick filaments can occur, and the muscle contracts. When calcium concentration in the cytosol falls, the binding sites of actin are covered, and contraction stops.

Fig 49-34. Hypothetical mechanism for the control of muscle contraction. The thin filament has two strands of actin twisted into a helix. (a) When the muscle is at rest, a long, rodlike tropomyosin molecule blocks the myosin binding sites that are instrumental in forming cross-bridges. (b) When another protein complex, troponin, binds calcium ions, the binding sites on actin are exposed, cross-bridges with myosin can form, and the muscle contracts.

Calcium concentration in the cytosol of the muscle cell is regulated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized endoplasmic reticulum (FIGURE 49.35). The membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum actively transports calcium from the cytosol into the interior of the reticulum, which is thus an intracellular storehouse for calcium.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-35. The roles of the muscle fiber's sarcoplasmic reticulum and T tubules in contraction. Diffusing across the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine depolarizes the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, and action potentials (blue arrows) sweep across the fiber and deep into it along T (transverse) tubules. Within the muscle cell the action potentials trigger the release of Ca2+ (green dots) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. The Ca2+ initiates the sliding of filaments by triggering the binding of myosin to actin.

The stimulus leading to the contraction of a skeletal muscle cell is an action potential in a motor neuron that makes a synaptic connection with the muscle cell. The synaptic terminal of the motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, depolarizing the postsynaptic muscle cell and triggering an action potential in the muscle cell. That action potential is the signal for contraction. The action potential spreads deep into the interior of the muscle cell along infoldings of the plasma membrane called T (transverse) tubules. Where the transverse tubules contact the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the action potential changes the permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing it to release calcium ions. These calcium ions bind to troponin, allowing the muscle to contract. Muscle contraction stops when the sarcoplasmic reticulum pumps the calcium back out of the cytosol, and the tropomyosin-troponin complex again blocks the myosin binding sites as the concentration of calcium falls (FIGURE 49.36).

 Diverse body movements require variation in muscle activity

Everyday experience suggests that the action of a whole muscle, such as the biceps, is graded; we can voluntarily alter the extent and strength of contraction. Experimental studies also confirm that whole-muscle contractions are graded. However, at the cellular level, any stimulus that depolarizes the plasma membrane of a single muscle fiber triggers an all-or-none contraction, analogous to the response of neurons to depolarizing stimuli. How does the nervous system produce graded contractions of whole muscles? One way is by varying the frequency of action potentials in the motor neurons controlling the muscle. A single action potential will produce an increase in muscle tension lasting about 100 msec or less, a single twitch (FIGURE 49.37). If a second action potential arrives before the response to the first is over, the tension will sum and produce a greater response. If a muscle receives an overlapping series of action potentials, further summation will occur, with the level of tension depending on the rate of stimulation. And if the rate of stimulation is fast enough, the twitches will blur into one smooth and sustained contraction called tetanus (not to be confused with the disease of the same name). Motor neurons usually deliver their action potentials in rapid-fire volleys, and the resulting summation of tension results in smooth contraction typical of tetanus rather than the jerky actions of individual muscle twitches.

Fig 49-37. Temporal summation of muscle cell contractions. This graph compares the tension developed in a muscle in response to a single action potential, a pair of action potentials, and a series of action potentials. The dashed lines show the response that would have resulted if only the first action potential had occurred.

The nervous system can also produce graded contraction of a whole muscle by taking advantage of the organization of the muscle cells into motor units. In a vertebrate muscle, each muscle cell is innervated by only one motor neuron, but each branched motor neuron may make synaptic connections with many muscle cells (FIGURE 49.38). There may be hundreds of motor neurons controlling an individual muscle, each with its own pool of muscle fibers scattered throughout the muscle. A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls. When the motor neuron fires, all the muscle fibers in the motor unit contract as a group. The strength of the resulting contraction will therefore depend on how many muscle fibers the motor neuron controls. In most muscles there is wide variation in the number of muscle fibers among motor units; some motor neurons may control only a few muscle cells, while others may control hundreds. The nervous system can thus regulate the strength of contraction in the whole muscle by both determining how many motor units are activated at a given instant and selecting whether large or small motor units are activated. Tension in a muscle can be progressively increased by activating more and more of the motor neurons controlling the muscle, a process called recruitment of motor neurons. Depending on the number and size of motor neurons your brain recruits to the task, you can lift a fork, or something much heavier, like your biology textbook.

Fig 49-38. Motor units in a vertebrate muscle. Each muscle fiber (cell) has a single neuromuscular junction, or synaptic connection, with the motor neuron that controls it. However, each motor neuron typically branches and controls several or many muscle fibers. A motor neuron and all the fibers it controls constitute a contractile apparatus called a motor unit.

Some muscles, especially those that hold the body up and maintain posture, are almost always partially contracted. However, prolonged contraction results in muscle fatigue caused by the depletion of ATP, dissipation of the ion gradients required for normal electrical signaling, and the accumulation of lactate (see FIGURE 9.17). In a mechanism that avoids fatigue in postural muscles, the nervous system alternates activation among the various motor units making up the muscle, so that different motor units take turns maintaining the prolonged contraction.

Fast and Slow Muscle Fibers

We have seen that the action potential in a skeletal muscle fiber is only a trigger for the contraction; the actual duration of the contraction is controlled by how long the calcium concentration in the cytosol remains elevated. Not all skeletal muscle fibers are identical in this regard. We can identify fast and slow fibers based on the duration of their twitches. Fast muscle fibers are used for rapid, powerful contractions. Some, such as the flight muscles of birds, may be able to sustain long periods of repeated contractions without fatiguing. By contrast, slow muscle fibers, which can sustain long contractions, are often found in muscles that maintain posture. A slow fiber has less sarcoplasmic reticulum than a fast fiber, so calcium remains in the cytosol longer. This causes a twitch in a slow fiber to last about five times longer than in a fast fiber. Slow fibers are also specialized to make use of a steady supply of energy; they have many mitochondria, a rich blood supply, and an oxygen-storing protein called myoglobin. Myoglobin, the brownish-red pigment in the dark meat of poultry and fish, binds oxygen more tightly than hemoglobin, so it can effectively extract oxygen from the blood.

Other Types of Muscle

There are many types of muscles in the animal kingdom, but as noted before, they all share the same fundamental mechanism of contraction: the sliding of actin filaments and myosin filaments past one another. In addition to skeletal muscle, vertebrates have cardiac muscle and smooth muscle (see FIGURE 40.4).

Vertebrate cardiac muscle is found in only one place--the heart. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated. The primary differences between skeletal and cardiac muscle are in their electrical and membrane properties. The junctions between cardiac muscle cells contain specialized regions called intercalated discs, where gap junctions (see FIGURE 7.30) provide direct electrical coupling among cells. Thus, an action potential generated in one part of the heart will spread to all the cardiac muscle cells, and the whole heart will contract. Skeletal muscle cells will not contract unless triggered to do so by input from a controlling motor neuron. Cardiac muscle cells, however, can generate action potentials on their own, without any input from the nervous system. The plasma membrane of a cardiac muscle cell has pacemaker properties that cause rhythmic depolarizations, triggering action potentials and causing single cardiac muscle cells to "beat" even when isolated from the heart and placed in cell culture. (But at the whole-organ level, the heart also has a pacemaker, specialized muscle tissue in the wall of the right atrium that coordinates contractions of cardiac muscle cells throughout the heart; see FIGURE 42.7.) The action potentials of cardiac muscle cells are also different from those of skeletal muscle cells, lasting up to twenty times longer. Whereas the action potential of a skeletal muscle cell serves only as a trigger for contraction and does not control the duration of contraction, in a cardiac cell the duration of the action potential plays an important role in controlling the duration of contraction.

Smooth muscle lacks the striations of skeletal and cardiac muscle because the actin and myosin filaments are not all regularly arrayed along the length of the cell. Instead, the filaments may have a spiral arrangement within smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle also contains less myosin than striated muscle, and the myosin is not associated with specific actin strands. Because of its organization, smooth muscle cannot generate nearly as much tension as striated muscle, but it can contract over a much greater range of lengths. Further, smooth muscle has neither a T tubule system nor a well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions must enter the cytosol via the plasma membrane during an action potential, and the amount reaching the filaments is rather small. Contractions are relatively slow, but there is a greater range of control than in striated muscle. Smooth muscle is found mainly in the walls of hollow organs such as digestive tract organs and blood vessels.

Invertebrates possess muscle cells similar to vertebrate skeletal and smooth muscle cells. Arthropod skeletal muscles are nearly identical to vertebrate skeletal muscles. However, the flight muscles of insects are capable of independent, rhythmic contraction, so the wings of some insects can actually beat faster than action potentials can arrive from the central nervous system. Another interesting evolutionary adaptation has been discovered in the muscles that hold clam shells closed. The thick filaments of these muscle fibers contain a unique protein called paramyosin that enables the muscles to remain in a fixed state of contraction with a low rate of energy consumption for as long as a month.

Although we have discussed sensory receptors and muscles separately in this chapter, they are part of a single integrated system linking together brain, body, and the external world. An animal's behavior, how the animal interacts with its environment, is the product of this system. Behavior is discussed in Unit Eight within the broader context of ecology, the study of interactions between organisms and their environment.
