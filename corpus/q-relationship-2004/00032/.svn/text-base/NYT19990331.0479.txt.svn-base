Michael .
The mere mention of the name conjures up a kaleidoscope of images and a lifetime of memories .
Having conquered the basketball universe , where does the next challenge lie for the world 's most prominent athlete ?
The back nine ?
Corporate America ?
Owner of a National Basketball Association franchise ?
Or will Michael Jordan come out of retirement at age 36 ?
While returning to the NBA may not be a priority for Jordan -- the league prohibits owners from being players -- the possibility of obtaining a controlling interest of a franchise is on Jordan 's mind .
Jordan has had preliminary discussions with Commissioner David Stern and the Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn about buying 50 percent of the team .
Apparently realizing Jordan cannot save the league on the floor anymore , Stern has enlisted Jordan to help resuscitate a troubled franchise in his home state of North Carolina .
Stern and Shinn , according to league and team officials , are the driving forces behind Jordan 's involvement .
The commissioner would not only delight in becoming the first commissioner to help award a former player a significant portion of a franchise , but Stern could also reduce the impact of Shinn 's tarnished reputation .
The owner has been named in a civil suit by a woman alleging sexual misconduct .
The district attorney in York County , S.C. , where the alleged misconduct took place , did not file criminal charges based on the original evidence .
But based on new evidence , there is interest in reopening the case .
Only two former recent players have been part owners of teams , Earvin -LRB- Magic -RRB- Johnson , a vice president with the Los Angeles Lakers , and Isiah Thomas , the former general manager of the Toronto Raptors and a current NBC analyst .
`` Just like with Magic , Bird or myself , I think Jordan should always have a connection to the NBA , '' Thomas said Wednesday .
`` It just makes sense , business-wise , and in other ways .
For Jordan to have no connection to the league would be a crime . ''
Thomas said that Stern and the deputy commissioner , Russ Granik , `` are both genuinely interested in seeing minorities own or be a part of franchise , whether it 's Jordan or J.R. Reid .
I do n't think that 's a league mandate , but that 's how I think they think as individuals .
I do n't think all of the 29 owners think that way . ''
Buck Williams , the former president of the players association and a 17-year veteran , has expressed interest in ownership with Jordan .
`` With Michael talking about 50 percent , that 's pretty much a monumental position , '' Williams said .
`` What Michael could do is grow the team and grow the revenues .
He could be the driving force behind a new arena .
He can use his status to encourage and help the growth of the team . ''
Jordan , who grew up in Wilmington , N.C. , and starred at the University of North Carolina , said staying involved in the NBA would be a `` fulfilling personal and business challenge . ''
Earlier this year , Jordan pronounced himself `` 99.9 percent '' retired .
Jordan issued a statement Monday confirming his interest in owning half the team .
`` At this stage , '' Jordan said , `` the discussions are very preliminary . ''
Jordan is on vacation in the Bahamas , but is expected to renew talks when he returns , a team official said .
`` I 've publicly criticized the NBA for their lack of minority owners , '' Williams said .
`` Most minority owners own maybe 1 percent and 2 percent .
It 's much needed in a predominantly black league .
Whether it be me , Michael or Dr. J. I do n't understand why they ca n't have an ownership stake . ''
Johnson bought 5 percent of the team from the Lakers ' owner , Jerry Buss , after his retirement in 1991 .
He sold the shares back to Buss after ill-fated comeback attempts and eventually reacquired the 5 percent , which he still holds .
Thomas owned as much 9 percent of the Raptors and sat on the team 's board of directors until two years ago .
But disagreements with the former majority owner , Allan Slaight , over financial matters relating to the building of a new arena forced him to resign and have the team buy out his portion .
`` It 's a great fit in many ways , but I would caution Jordan to be careful who you 're partners with , '' Thomas said , referring to Shinn .
Responding to a report by Fox Sports that Jordan would return to the NBA with the Hornets , David Falk , Jordan 's agent , said Wednesday , `` There 's absolutely no truth to it . ''
