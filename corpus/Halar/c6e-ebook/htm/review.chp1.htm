A moving object has kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored in the location or structure of matter and includes chemical energy stored in molecular structure. Energy can change form, governed by the laws of thermodynamics.</p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 6A: <span class="Emphasis1">Energy Transformations</span></span></p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The energy transformations of life are subject to two laws of thermodynamics (pp. 89-90,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.3</span> <span class="Emphasis2">and</span> <span class="SmallCap">6.4</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The first, conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. The second states that when energy changes form, entropy (<span class="Emphasis1">S</span>), or the disorder of the universe, increases. Matter can become more ordered only if the surroundings become more disordered.</p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Organisms live at the expense of free energy (pp. 91-94,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.5</span>-<span class="SmallCap">6.7</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> A living system's free energy is energy that can do work under cellular conditions. Free energy (<span class="Emphasis1">G</span>) is related directly to total energy (<span class="Emphasis1">H</span>) and to entropy (<span class="Emphasis1">S</span>): <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">G</span> = <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">H</span> - <span class="Emphasis1">T</span> <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">S</span>. Spontaneous changes involve a decrease in free energy (- <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). In an exergonic (spontaneous) chemical reaction, the products have less free energy than the reactants (- <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). Endergonic (nonspontaneous) reactions require an input of energy (+ <span class="symbol">D</span> <span class="Emphasis1">G</span>). In cellular metabolism, exergonic reactions power endergonic reactions (energy coupling). The addition of starting materials and the removal of end products prevent metabolism from reaching equilibrium.</p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions (pp. 94-96,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 6.8</span>-<span class="SmallCap">6.10</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> ATP is the cell's energy shuttle. Release of its terminal phosphate group produces ADP, inorganic phosphate, and free energy. ATP drives endergonic reactions by transfer of the phosphate to specific reactants, making them more reactive. In this way, cells can carry out work, such as movement and anabolism. Catabolic pathways drive the regeneration of ATP from ADP and phosphate.</p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 6B: <span class="Emphasis1">The Structure of ATP</span></span></p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 6C: <span class="Emphasis1">Chemical Reactions and ATP</span></span></p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">ENZYMES</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers (pp. 96-97,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 6.12</span> <span class="Emphasis2">and</span> <span class="SmallCap">6.13</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Enzymes, which are proteins, are biological catalysts.

In agriculture, the most frequently used organophosphates account for half of the 58 million pounds applied annually nationwide. Organophosphates typically interfere with nerve transmission by inhibiting the enzymes that degrade the transmitter molecules that diffuse from one neuron to another.
