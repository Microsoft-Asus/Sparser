BAGHDAD , Iraq
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
At least 400 weapons inspectors and other U.N. staff left Baghdad on Wednesday in a major pullout of `` nonessential '' U.N. workers amid preparations for a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq .
A convoy of 11 buses and vans carrying more than 100 arms inspectors and their luggage rolled out of the U.N. Special Commission 's headquarters Wednesday morning .
About 300 other U.N. staff , apparently humanitarian workers , departed four hours later .
Many of those leaving hugged U.N. workers -- including Iraqi staffers -- who remained behind .
None of the U.N. employees would speak with reporters as they boarded the buses .
As the vehicles left , U.N. workers were installing screens over the windows of the headquarters , a move apparently aimed at preventing glass from shattering into the building during a military strike .
The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting Wednesday as Secretary - General Kofi Annan appealed to Saddam Hussein to immediately resume cooperation with the U.N. inspectors .
Annan said he was `` saddened and burdened '' by Iraq 's decision to halt the inspections .
The U.N. envoy to Iraq , Prakash Shah , told reporters in Baghdad that the world body had decided to withdraw its personnel because of a possible military attack .
Eric Falt , spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq , told reporters the withdrawal was `` precautionary '' and taken `` solely with the safety of U.N. staff in mind . ''
The United States and Britain have warned that they may use military force to try to force Baghdad to back down from its decision to freeze all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections .
U.S. President Bill Clinton met Tuesday with senior Pentagon officials to explore options for a military attack , and Washington has stepped up the movement of U.S. ships into the region .
Iraq has said it will not cooperate with inspectors until the Security Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990 , sparking the Gulf War .
The Security Council maintains the embargo wo n't be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction .
The U.S. State Department issued travel advisories on Wednesday , telling U.S. citizens to consider leaving Kuwait , Israel and Palestinian areas in light of the growing tensions .
The department also began withdrawing nonessential personnel and their families Wednesday from embassies in Israel and Kuwait .
It cited no specific threat in urging the employees to leave .
Israeli officials said Wednesday that Israel , the target of Iraqi missiles during the Gulf War , does not consider itself to be a player in the current showdown .
Attitudes toward Baghdad appeared to be hardening elsewhere .
Foreign ministers from Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Iceland jointly condemned Iraq 's refusal to cooperate with U.N. inspectors , according to statement issued today in Oslo , Norway .
In Moscow , Vladimir Zhirinovsky 's ultranationalist party failed Wednesday to win approval for a parliamentary motion calling for sanctions against Iraq to be lifted .
However , Shah said Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told him today that Iraqi officials would not change their position .
`` They will not be able to desist from their position unless the Security Council takes some action in regard to the sanctions on Iraq , '' Shah said , summarizing Aziz 's views .
Before Wednesday 's departures , there were about 120 personnel from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency in the country , along with about 450 humanitarian workers .
Those withdrawn Wednesday included not only all UNSCOM staff but monitors for the IAEA and other U.N. workers who run the oil-for-food program supplying aid to the Iraqi people .
The arms inspectors flew to the Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain , while others were traveling aboard five buses for the or 10-hour trip to neighboring Jordan .
The current crisis began Aug. 5 when Iraq said it would not cooperate with the Special Commission .
It let some personnel continue long-term monitoring , but on Oct. 31 it stopped even that work .
A leading Arabic newspaper quoted diplomats Wednesday as saying the United States and Britain have planned a three-phase strike against Iraq that could involve the deployment of troops in the country .
The London -based daily Al - Hayat reported that after each phase of military action , the allies would present Iraq with a list of demands pending further strikes .
The diplomats , who spoke on condition of anonymity from Amman , Jordan , did not specify the demands , the paper reported .
The United States and Britain maintain they have backing in the Middle East for a military strike , but Arab officials have offered no public support for using force .
Jordan 's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh met Wednesday with Saudi Arabia 's Kind Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah and said later the two countries `` are in agreement that the crisis ... should be solved diplomatically . ''
But he added : `` It appears that attempts to defuse the crisis could be late . ''
