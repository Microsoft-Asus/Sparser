HONG KONG , August 29 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Local media today condemned the visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikedo who claimed China 's territory Diaoyu Islands as part of Japan 's and refused to make commitment to pay compensations for victims of World War II .
Tin Tin Daily News pointed out in an editorial that it is an indisputable fact that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China .
It said that the Diaoyu Islands were seized by the Japanese aggressors in 1895 when they occupied Taiwan .
On the issue of the Diaoyu Islands , Ikedo said here Wednesday that there was nothing to discuss as far as his government was concerned because the islands were an inseparable part of Japan 's territory .
The daily said that the Japanese foreign minister 's arrogant attitude toward China 's sovereignty has aroused great indignation of the Chinese people in Hong Kong .
Wen Wei Po , Ming Pao Daily News and Sing Tao Daily also criticized the Japanese foreign minister for whitewashing Japanese crimes during World War II .
Some other newspapers and TV stations criticized the Japanese foreign minister for `` talking wildly , '' saying that Ikedo 's action would drive Hong Kong people into a big rage .
Since his arrival in Hong Kong on Wednesday , Yukihiko Ikedo has encountered several groups of protesters seeking billions of dollars in compensation for war victims and claiming China 's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands .
About 300 members of the Reparation Association marched to the Japanese consulate , calling on the Japanese government to reimburse the women forced into sex slavery during the war as well as holders of now worthless Japanese military scrip and currency .
A group of demonstrators maintained an overnight vigil outside a hotel , where Ikedo was staying .
They tried to hand in a petition , urging Japan to apologize for its war crimes and take prompt action to resolve the issue .
Ikedo was here for a two-day stopover on his way back to Japan from the Middle East .
