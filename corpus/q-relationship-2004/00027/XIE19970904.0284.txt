ROME , September 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Researchers studying the human form of the `` mad cow '' disease said they have found out how it travels through the body and replicates before attacking the brain , which could be the first step to give `` mad cow '' disease its scientific name , ANSA reported today .
The Italian researcher , Adriano Aguzzi , together with other scientists in his team at Zurich University 's Institute of Neuropathology said the discovery could help find effective treatment for Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , the human disorder linked to the BSE , or bovine spongiform encephalography .
`` It 's early to draw conclusions , '' Aguzzi said , `` and we do n't know whether we 'll find a cure for this disease , but we now have a clear idea of what we are looking for . ''
His research was carried out on mice infected with scrapies , the sheep 's equivalent of the BSE or Creutzfeldt - Jakob .
Aguzzi and his team followed the anomalous prions -LRB- proteins -RRB- believed to cause `` mad cow '' from the stomach to the spleen and the lymphatic system .
As a result , they found out that `` mad cow '' replicate multiply with the help of normal prions once they reach these two sites , building up sufficient numbers to attack the brain in force through the peripheral nervous system .
Since the abnormal proteins called prions cause irreversible damage when they hit the brain , so the treatment for `` mad cow '' could involve stopping prions from multiplying in the peripheral nervous system , according to Aguzzi .
The outbreak of `` mad cow '' disease in Britain led to a major crisis in EU relations over restrictions on exports of suspected British beef , and the measures to be taken to curb the disease .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">To halt the spread of the BSE , Britain has banned beef sales and agreed to slaughter over 120,000 suspected heads of cattle .
The `` mad cow '' disease , which struck most heavily in England , has appeared sporadically in the rest of the British Isles and elsewhere in Europe .</ENAMEX>
