PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 An ecosystem's energy budget depends on primary production



 

 In aquatic ecosystems, light and nutrients limit primary production



 

 In terrestrial ecosystems, temperature, moisture, and nutrients limit primary production



The amount of light energy converted to chemical energy (organic compounds) by an ecosystem's autotrophs during a given time period is called primary production. This photosynthetic product is the starting point for studies of ecosystem metabolism and energy flow.
