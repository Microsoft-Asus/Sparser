 A signal molecule binds to a receptor protein, causing the protein to change shape



 

 Most signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins



When we speak to someone, others nearby may hear our message, sometimes with unfortunate consequences. However, errors of this kind rarely occur among cells. The signals emitted by an a yeast cell are "heard" only by its prospective mates, a cells. Similarly, although epinephrine encounters many types of cells as it circulates in the blood, only certain target cells detect and react to the hormone. The signal receptor is the identity tag on the target cell.
