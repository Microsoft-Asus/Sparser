Every organism is an open system connected to its environment by a continuous exchange of energy and materials. In the energy flow and chemical cycling that keep an ecosystem alive, plants and other photosynthetic autotrophs perform the key step of transforming inorganic compounds into organic ones. Autotrophic does not mean autonomous, however. Plants need sunlight as the energy source for photosynthesis. And to synthesize organic matter, plants also require raw materials in the form of inorganic substances: carbon dioxide, water, and a variety of minerals present as inorganic ions in the soil. With its ramifying root system and shoot system (see the photograph of a hyacinth above), a plant is extensively networked with its environment--the soil and air, which are the reservoirs of the plant's inorganic nutrients. In this chapter, you will learn more about the nutritional requirements of plants and examine some of the structural and physiological adaptations for plant nutrition that have evolved.

Of all mineral elements, nitrogen is the one that most often limits the growth of plants and the yields of crops. Plants require nitrogen as an ingredient of proteins, nucleic acids, and other important organic molecules.

 Mycorrhizae and root nodules may have an evolutionary relationship



The roots of plants belong to subterranean communities that include a diversity of other organisms. Among those organisms are certain species of bacteria and fungi that have coevolved with specific plants, forming symbiotic relationships with roots that enhance the nutrition of both partners. The two most important examples are symbiotic nitrogen fixation (roots and bacteria) and the formation of mycorrhizae (roots and fungi).





NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS: PARASITISM AND PREDATION BY PLANTS

 

 Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants



 

 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals



Symbiotic nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae underscore the relationship between plants and their environment, which includes the other organisms that interact with plants. We conclude this chapter by exploring predation and parasitism as two other types of plant adaptations that enhance nutrition through interactions with other organisms.





 The chemical composition of plants provides clues to their nutritional requirements

Watch a large plant grow from a tiny seed, and you cannot help wondering where all the mass comes from. Aristotle thought that soil provided the substance for plant growth, because plants seemed to spring from the ground. Leaves, he believed, functioned only to shade the developing fruit. In the 17th century, a Belgian physician named Jean-Baptiste van Helmont performed an experiment to test the hypothesis that plants grow by absorbing soil. He planted a willow seedling in a pot that contained 90.9 kg of soil. After five years, the willow had grown into a tree weighing 76.8 kg, but only 0.06 kg of soil had disappeared from the pot. Van Helmont concluded that the willow had grown mainly from the water he had added regularly. A century later, Stephen Hales, an English physiologist, postulated that plants are nourished mostly by air.

As it turns out, none of the early ideas about plant nutrition is entirely incorrect. Plants do extract minerals from the soil. Mineral nutrients are essential chemical elements absorbed from the soil in the form of inorganic ions. For example, plants need nitrogen, which they acquire from the soil mainly in the form of nitrate ions (NO3-). However, as we can conclude from van Helmont's data, mineral nutrients from the soil make only a small contribution to the overall mass of the plant. About 80-85%  of a herbaceous (nonwoody) plant is water, and plants grow mainly by accumulating water in the central vacuoles of their cells. Furthermore, water can truly be considered a nutrient because it supplies most of the hydrogen atoms and some of the oxygen atoms that are incorporated into organic compounds by photosynthesis (see FIGURE 10.3). However, only a small fraction of the water that enters a plant contributes atoms to organic molecules. Generally, more than 90%  of the water absorbed by plants is lost by transpiration, and most of the water retained by the plant functions as a solvent, provides most of the mass for cell elongation, and helps maintain the form of soft tissue by keeping cells turgid. By weight, the bulk of the organic material of a plant is derived not from water or soil minerals, but from the CO2 assimilated from the atmosphere (FIGURE 37.1).

Fig 37-1. The uptake of nutrients by a plant: an overview. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil, with mycorrhizae and root hairs greatly increasing surface area for absorption. Carbon dioxide, the source of carbon for photo-synthesis, diffuses into leaves from the sur-rounding air through stomata. (Plants also need O2 for cellular respiration, although the plant is a net producer of O2.) From these inorganic nutrients the plant can produce all of its own organic material.

We can measure water content by comparing the weight of plant material before and after it is dried. We can then analyze the chemical composition of the dry residue. Organic substances account for about 95%  of the dry weight, with inorganic substances making up the remaining 5% . Most of the organic material is carbohydrate, including the cellulose of cell walls. Thus, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, the ingredients of carbohydrates, are the most abundant elements in the dry weight of a plant. Because some organic molecules contain nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus, these elements are also relatively abundant in plants.

More than 50 chemical elements have been identified among the inorganic substances present in plants, but it is unlikely that all these elements are essential. Roots are able to absorb minerals somewhat selectively, enabling the plant to accumulate essential elements that may be present in the soil in very minute quantities. To a certain extent, however, the minerals in a plant reflect the composition of the soil in which the plant is growing. Plants growing on mine tailings, for instance, may contain gold or silver. Studying the chemical composition of plants provides clues about their nutritional requirements, but we must distinguish elements that are essential from those that are merely present in the plant.





 Plants require nine macronutrients and at least eight micronutrients

A particular chemical element is considered an essential nutrient if it is required for a plant to grow from a seed and complete the life cycle, producing another generation of seeds. Researchers can use a method known as hydroponic culture to determine which of the mineral elements are actually essential nutrients (FIGURE 37.2). Such studies have helped identify 17 elements that are essential nutrients in all plants and a few other elements that are essential to certain groups of plants. Most research has involved crop plants; little is known about the specific nutritional needs of uncultivated plants, even some of the most commercially important conifers that provide lumber.

Fig 37-2. Using hydroponic culture to identify essential nutrients. A researcher bathes the roots of plants in solutions of various minerals dissolved in known concentrations. Aerating the water provides the roots with oxygen for cellular respiration. A particular mineral, such as potassium, can be omitted from the culture medium to test whether it is essential to the plants. If the element deleted from the mineral solution is an essential nutrient, then the incomplete medium will cause plants to become abnormal in appear-ance compared with controls grown on a complete mineral medium. The most common symptoms of a mineral deficiency are stunted growth and discolored leaves.

Elements required by plants in relatively large amounts are called macronutrients. There are nine macronutrients in all, including the six major ingredients of organic compounds: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The other three macronutrients are potassium, calcium, and magnesium. (TABLE 37.1 lists some of their functions.)

The eight micronutrients are iron, chlorine, copper, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, boron, and nickel. These elements function in plants mainly as cofactors of enzymatic reactions (see Chapter 6). Iron, for example, is a metallic component of cytochromes, the proteins that function in the electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is because micronutrients generally play catalytic roles that plants need only minute quantities of these elements. The requirement for molybdenum, for example, is so modest that there is only one atom of this rare element for every 16 million atoms of hydrogen in dried plant material. Yet a deficiency of molybdenum or any other micronutrient can weaken or kill a plant.





 The symptoms of a mineral deficiency depend on the function and mobility of the element

The symptoms of a mineral deficiency depend partly on the function of that nutrient in the plant. For example, a deficiency of magnesium, an ingredient of chlorophyll, causes yellowing of the leaves, or chlorosis (FIGURE 37.3). In some cases, the relationship between a mineral deficiency and its symptoms is less direct. For instance, iron deficiency can cause chlorosis even though chlorophyll contains no iron, because this metal is required as a cofactor in one of the steps of chlorophyll synthesis.

Fig 37-3. Magnesium deficiency in a tomato plant. Yellowing of the leaves (chlorosis) is the result of an inability to synthesize chlorophyll, which contains magnesium.

Mineral deficiency symptoms depend not only on the role of the nutrient in the plant but also on its mobility within the plant. If a nutrient moves about freely from one part of the plant to another, symptoms of a deficiency will show up first in older organs. This is because young, growing tissues have more "drawing power" than old tissues for nutrients that are in short supply. (The mechanism for this preferential routing is the source-to-sink translocation in phloem that you learned about in Chapter 36.) A plant starved for magnesium, for example, will show signs of chlorosis first in its older leaves. Magnesium, which is relatively mobile in the plant, is shunted preferentially to young leaves. In contrast, a deficiency of a nutrient that is relatively immobile within a plant will affect young parts of the plant first. Older tissues may have adequate amounts of the mineral, which they are able to retain during periods of short supply. For example, iron does not move freely within a plant, and a deficiency of iron will cause yellowing of young leaves before any effect on older leaves is visible.

The symptoms of a mineral deficiency are often distinctive enough for a plant physiologist or farmer to diagnose its cause. One way to confirm the diagnosis of a specific deficiency is to analyze the mineral content of the plant and soil. Deficiencies of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus are the most common problems. Shortages of micronutrients are less common and tend to be geographically localized because of differences in soil composition. The amount of a micronutrient needed to correct a deficiency is usually quite small. For example, a zinc deficiency in fruit trees can usually be cured by hammering a few zinc nails into each tree trunk. Moderation is important because overdoses of some micronutrients can be toxic to plants.

One way to ensure optimal mineral nutrition is to grow plants hydroponically on nutrient solutions that can be precisely regulated (FIGURE 37.4). Hydroponics is currently practiced commercially, but only on a limited scale, because the requirements for equipment and labor make hydroponic farming relatively expensive compared with growing crops in soil.

Perhaps astronauts living in a space station will one day grow their vegetables hydroponically, but because of the expense, it is unlikely that this type of farming will relieve hunger here on Earth.

Mineral deficiencies are not limited to terrestrial ecosystems, nor are they unique to plants among photosynthetic organisms. Vast "pastures" of algae in the world's southern oceans are capable of explosive blooms, restrained only by deficiencies of iron in the seawater. In a limited trial in the relatively unproductive seas between Tasmania and Antarctica, researchers demonstrated that dispersing small amounts of iron produces large algal blooms that pull carbon dioxide out of the air. Seeding the ocean with iron might help slow the increase in global carbon dioxide levels that has occurred because of our burning of fossil fuels (and which contributes to global warming by the greenhouse effect; see Chapter 54). Despite the possible benefits, widespread adoption of iron fertilization must be approached warily, given the many uncertain ecological and climatological effects it could have.





 Soil characteristics are key environmental factors in terrestrial ecosystems

The texture and chemical composition of soil are major factors determining what kinds of plants can grow well in a particular location, be it a natural ecosystem or an agricultural region. (Climate, of course, is another important factor.) Plants that grow naturally in a certain type of soil are adapted to its mineral content and texture and are able to absorb water and extract essential nutrients from that soil. In interacting with the soil that supports their growth, plants, in turn, affect the soil, as we will soon see. The soil-plant interface is a critical component of the chemical cycles that sustain terrestrial ecosystems.

Texture and Composition of Soils

Soil has its origin in the weathering of solid rock. Water that seeps into crevices and freezes in winter fractures the rock, and acids dissolved in the water also help to break down the rock. Once organisms are able to invade the rock, they accelerate the breakdown. Lichens, fungi, bacteria, mosses, and the roots of vascular plants all secrete acids, and the expansion of roots growing in fissures cracks rocks and pebbles. The eventual result of all this activity is topsoil, a mixture of particles derived from rock, living organisms, and humus, a residue of partially decayed organic material. The topsoil and other distinct soil layers, or horizons, are often visible in vertical profile where there is a roadcut or deep hole (FIGURE 37.5).

Fig 37-5. Soil horizons. This researcher is photographing a vertical profile of three soil layers, or horizons, in a Tennessee cotton field.

The texture of topsoil depends on the size of its particles, which are classified in a range from coarse sand to microscopic clay particles. The most fertile soils are usually loams, made up of roughly equal amounts of sand, silt (particles of intermediate size), and clay. Loamy soils have enough fine particles to provide a large surface area for retaining minerals and water, which adhere to the particles. But loams also have enough coarse particles to provide air spaces containing oxygen that can be used by roots for cellular respiration. If soil does not drain adequately, roots suffocate because the air spaces are replaced by water; the roots may also be attacked by molds favored by the soaked soil. These are common hazards for houseplants that are overwatered in pots with poor drainage. Some plants, however, are adapted to waterlogged soil. For example, mangroves that inhabit swamps and marshes have some of their roots modified as hollow tubes that grow upward and function as snorkels, bringing down oxygen from the air.

Topsoil is home to an astonishing number and variety of organisms. A teaspoon of soil has about 5 billion bacteria that cohabit with various fungi, algae and other protists, insects, earthworms, nematodes, and the roots of plants. The activities of all these organisms affect the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Earthworms, for instance, aerate the soil by their burrowing and add mucus that holds fine soil particles together. The metabolism of bacteria alters the mineral composition of the soil. Plant roots extract water and minerals but also affect soil pH and reinforce the soil against erosion.

Humus, an important component of topsoil, is the decomposing organic material formed by the action of bacteria and fungi on dead organisms, feces, fallen leaves, and other organic refuse. Humus prevents clay from packing together and builds a crumbly soil that retains water but is still porous enough for the adequate aeration of roots. Humus is also a reservoir of mineral nutrients that are returned gradually to the soil as microorganisms decompose the organic matter.

The Availability of Soil Water and Minerals

After a heavy rainfall, water drains away from the larger spaces of the soil, but smaller spaces retain water because of its attraction for the soil particles, which have electrically charged surfaces. Some of this water adheres so tightly to the hydrophilic soil particles that it cannot be extracted by plants. The film of water bound less tightly to the particles is the water generally available to plants (FIGURE 37.6a, p. 772). It is not pure water, but a soil solution containing dissolved minerals. Roots absorb this soil solution.

Fig 37-6. The availability of soil water and minerals.

Many minerals in soil--especially those that are positively charged, such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+)--adhere by electrical attraction to the negatively charged surfaces of clay particles. The presence of clay in a soil helps prevent the leaching (draining away) of mineral nutrients during heavy rain or irrigation because the finely divided particles provide so much surface area for binding minerals. However, clay particles must release their bound minerals to the soil solution in order for roots to absorb the nutrients. Minerals that are negatively charged, such as nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (H2PO4-), and sulfate (SO42-), are usually not bound tightly to soil particles and thus tend to leach away more quickly. Positively charged minerals are made available to the plant when hydrogen ions in the soil displace the mineral ions from the clay particles. This process, called cation exchange, is stimulated by the roots themselves, which secrete H+ and compounds that form acids in the soil solution (FIGURE 37.6b).





 Soil conservation is one step toward sustainable agriculture

It may take centuries for a soil to become fertile through the breakdown of rock and the accumulation of organic material, but human mismanagement can destroy that fertility within a few years. Soil mismanagement has been a recurring problem in human history. For example, the Dust Bowl was an ecological and human disaster that took place in the southwestern Great Plains region of the United States in the 1930s. Before the arrival of farmers, the region was covered by hardy grasses that held the soil in place in spite of the long recurrent droughts and torrential rains characteristic of the region. However, in the 30 years before World War I, a large number of homesteaders settled in the region, planting wheat and raising cattle. Both of these land uses left the soil exposed to the danger of erosion by the winds that constantly sweep over the area (FIGURE 37.7). Bad luck in the form of a few years of drought made the problem worse. In many places, 8-10 cm of topsoil were blown away. Millions of hectares of farmland became useless, and hundreds of thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes and land. Better soil conservation practices could have preserved the soil's fertility and sustained agricultural productivity.

Fig 37-7. Poor soil conservation has contributed to ecological disasters such as the Dust Bowl. The widespread planting of wheat and the raising of cattle by homesteaders in the southwestern plains states in the early part of the 20th century, in combination with recurrent droughts, left the land susceptible to wind erosion. The organic matter, clay, and silt in the soil were carried great distances by the winds, in some cases darkening the sky as far as the Atlantic coast. Sand and heavier materials drifted against houses, fences, and barns. In the 1930s, hundreds of thousands of people abandoned their homesteads. Many became destitute migrant laborers in California. Their plight was immortalized as a symbol of the Great Depression in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.

To understand soil conservation, we must begin with the premise that agriculture is unnatural. In forests, grasslands, and other natural ecosystems, mineral nutrients are usually recycled by the decomposition of dead organic material in the soil. In contrast, when we harvest a crop, essential elements are diverted from the chemical cycles going on in that location. In general, agriculture depletes the mineral content of the soil. To grow a ton of wheat grain, the soil gives up 18.2 kg of nitrogen, 3.6 kg of phosphorus, and 4.1 kg of potassium. Each year, the fertility of the soil diminishes unless fertilizers are applied to replace the lost minerals. Many crops also use far more water than the natural vegetation that once grew on that land, forcing farmers to irrigate. Prudent fertilization, thoughtful irrigation, and the prevention of erosion are three of the most important goals of soil conservation.

Fertilizers

Prehistoric farmers may have started fertilizing their fields after noticing that grass grew faster and greener where animals had defecated. The Romans used manure to fertilize their crops, and Native Americans buried fish along with seeds when they planted corn. In developed nations today, most farmers use commercially produced fertilizers containing minerals that are either mined or prepared by industrial processes. These fertilizers are usually enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the three mineral elements most commonly deficient in farm and garden soils. Commercial fertilizers, such as those you can buy in a garden shop, are labeled with a three-number code that indicates the mineral content. A fertilizer marked "10-12-8," for instance, is 10%  nitrogen (as ammonium or nitrate), 12%  phosphorus (as phosphoric acid), and 8%  potassium (as the mineral potash).

Manure, fishmeal, and compost are referred to as "organic" fertilizers because they are of biological origin and contain organic material that is in the process of decomposing. However, before the elements in compost can be of any use to plants, the organic material must be decomposed to the inorganic nutrients that roots can absorb. In the end, the minerals a plant extracts from the soil are in the same form whether they came from organic fertilizer or from a chemical factory. Compost releases minerals gradually, however, whereas the minerals in commercial fertilizers are available immediately but may not be retained by the soil for long. Excess minerals not taken up by the plants are usually wasted because they are often leached from the soil by rainwater or irrigation. To make matters worse, this mineral runoff may pollute the ground water and eventually reach streams and lakes. Agricultural researchers are attempting to develop ways to reduce the use of fertilizers while maintaining crop yields.

To fertilize judiciously, a farmer must pay close attention to the pH of the soil. Soil pH not only affects cation exchange but also influences the chemical form of all minerals. Even though an essential element may be abundant in the soil, plants may be starving for that element because it is bound too tightly to clay or is in a chemical form the plant cannot absorb. Managing the pH of soil is tricky; a change in hydrogen ion concentration may make one mineral more available to the plant while causing another mineral to become less available. At pH 8, for instance, the plant can absorb calcium, but iron is almost completely unavailable. The pH of the soil should be matched to the specific mineral needs of the crop. If the soil is too alkaline, sulfate can be added to lower the pH. Soil that is too acidic can be adjusted by liming (adding calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide).

A major problem with acid soils, particularly in tropical areas, is that aluminum dissolves in the soil at low pH and becomes toxic to roots. Some plants are able to cope with high aluminum levels in the soil by secreting certain organic anions that bind the aluminum and render it harmless.

Irrigation

Even more than mineral deficiencies, the unavailability of water most often limits the growth of plants. Irrigation can transform a desert into a garden, but farming in arid regions is a huge drain on water resources. Many of the rivers in the southwestern United States have been reduced to trickles by the diversion of water for irrigation. (Quenching the thirst of growing cities adds to the problem.) Another problem is that irrigation in an arid region can gradually make the soil so salty that it becomes completely infertile. Salts dissolved in the irrigation water accumulate in the soil as the water evaporates. Eventually, the salt makes the water potential of the soil solution lower than that of root cells, which then lose water instead of absorbing it (see Chapter 36).

As the world population continues to grow, more and more acres of arid land will have to be cultivated. New methods of irrigation may reduce the risks of running out of water or losing farmland to salinization (salt accumulation). For instance, drip irrigation is now used as an alternative to flooding fields for many of the crops and orchards in Israel and the western United States. In another approach to solving some of the problems of dryland farming, plant breeders are working to develop varieties of plants that require less water.

Erosion

Topsoil from thousands of acres of farmland is lost to water and wind erosion each year in the United States alone. Certain precautions can help reduce these losses. Rows of trees dividing fields make effective windbreaks, and terracing a hillside can prevent the topsoil from washing away in a heavy rain (FIGURE 37.8). Such crops as alfalfa and wheat provide good ground cover and protect the soil better than corn and other crops that are usually planted in rows.

Fig 37-8. The Grapes of Wrath. Contour tillage. These crops in Wisconsin are planted in rows that go around, rather than up and down, the hills. Contour tillage helps slow the runoff of water and erosion of topsoil after heavy rains.

If managed properly, soil is a renewable resource in which farmers can grow food for generations to come. The goal is sustainable agriculture, a commitment embracing a variety of farming methods that are conservation-minded, environmentally safe, and profitable.

Phytoremediation

Some areas have become unfit for agriculture or wildlife as a result of human activities that contaminate the soil or groundwater with toxic heavy metals or organic pollutants. Nonbiological technologies to detoxify soils, such as the removal and storage of contaminated soil in landfills, are costly and disrup tive to the landscape. Phytoremediation is an emerging, nondestructive technology that seeks to reclaim such contaminated areas cheaply by taking advantage of the remarkable ability of some plant species to extract heavy metals and other pollutants from the soil and to concentrate them in easily harvested portions of the plant. For example, alpine pennycress (Thlaspi caerulescens) can accumulate zinc in its shoots at concentrations that are 300 times the level that most plants can tolerate. The use of such plants for phytoremediation shows promise for cleaning up areas contaminated by smelters, mining operations, or nuclear testing. Phytoremediation is just part of the more general technology of bioremediation, which includes the use of prokaryotes for detoxifying polluted sites (see Chapters 27 and 55).





 The metabolism of soil bacteria makes nitrogen available to plants

It is ironic that plants sometimes suffer nitrogen deficiencies, for the atmosphere is nearly 80%  nitrogen. This atmospheric nitrogen, however, is gaseous N2, and plants cannot use nitrogen in that form. For plants to absorb nitrogen, it must first be converted to ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-). In contrast to other minerals, the NH4+ and NO3- in soil are not derived from the breakdown of parent rock. Over the short term, the main source of nitrogenous minerals is the decomposition of humus by microbes, including ammonifying bacteria (FIGURE 37.9). In this way, nitrogen present in organic compounds, such as proteins, is repackaged in inorganic compounds that can be recycled when they are absorbed as minerals by roots. However, nitrogen is lost from this local cycle when soil microbes called denitrifying bacteria convert NO3- to N2, which diffuses from the soil to the atmosphere. Still other bacteria, called nitrogen-fixing bacteria, restock nitrogenous minerals in the soil by converting N2 to NH3 (ammonia), a metabolic process called nitrogen fixation. The complex cycling of nitrogen in ecosystems is traced in detail in Chapter 54. Here we focus on nitrogen fixation and the other steps that lead directly to nitrogen assimilation by plants.

Fig 37-9. The role of soil bacteria in the nitrogen nutrition of plants. Ammonium is made available to plants by two types of soil bacteria: those that fix atmospheric N2 (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) and those that decompose organic material (ammonifying bacteria). Although plants absorb some ammonium from the soil, they absorb mainly nitrate, which is produced from ammonium by nitrifying bacteria. Plants reduce nitrate back to ammonium before incorporating the nitrogen into organic compounds. Xylem transports nitrogen from roots to shoots in the form of nitrate, amino acids, and various other organic compounds, depending on the species.

All life on Earth depends on nitrogen fixation, a process performed only by certain prokaryotes. Soil is populated by sev eral species of free-living bacteria that are among the nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes. (Other species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in plant roots in symbiotic relationships you will learn more about in the next section.) The conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a complicated, multi-step process, but we can simplify nitrogen fixation by just indicating the reactants and products:  One enzyme complex, called nitrogenase, catalyzes the entire reaction sequence, which reduces N2 to NH3 by adding electrons along with hydrogen ions. Notice that nitrogen fixation is very expensive in terms of metabolic energy, costing the bacteria eight ATP molecules for each ammonia molecule synthesized. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are most abundant in soils rich in organic material, which provides fuel for cellular respiration.

In the soil solution, ammonia picks up another hydrogen ion to form ammonium (NH4+), which plants can absorb. However, plants acquire their nitrogen mainly in the form of nitrate (NO3-), which is produced in the soil by nitrifying bacteria that oxidize ammonium (see FIGURE 37.9). After nitrate is absorbed by roots, a plant enzyme can reduce the nitrate back to ammonium, which other enzymes can then incorporate into amino acids and other organic compounds. Most plant species export nitrogen from roots to shoots, via the xylem, in the form of nitrate or organic compounds that have been synthesized in the roots.





 Improving the protein yield of crops is a major goal of agricultural research

The ability of plants to incorporate fixed nitrogen into proteins and other organic substances has a major impact on human welfare; the most common form of malnutrition in humans is protein deficiency. Either by choice or by economic necessity, the majority of people in the world--particularly in developing countries--have a predominantly vegetarian diet and thus depend mainly on plants for protein. Unfortunately, many plants have a low protein content, and the proteins that are present may be deficient in one or more of the amino acids that humans need from their diet. Improving the quality and quantity of proteins in crops is a major goal of agricultural research.

Plant breeding has resulted in new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice that are enriched in protein. However, many of these "super" varieties have an extraordinary demand for nitrogen, which is usually supplied in the form of commercial fertilizer. The industrial production of ammonia and nitrate from atmospheric nitrogen is, like biological nitrogen fixation, very expensive in energy costs. A chemical factory making fertilizer consumes large quantities of fossil fuels. Generally, the countries that most need high-protein crops are the ones least able to afford to pay the fuel bill. The use of new catalysts based on the mechanism by which nitrogenase fixes nitrogen may make commercial fertilizer production less costly in the future. Biochemists determined the structure of Rhizobium nitrogenase several years ago, providing a model for chemical engineers to design catalysts by imitating nature. Another strategy that could potentially increase protein yields of crops is to improve the productivity of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a process we examine in the next section.





 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation results from intricate interactions between roots and bacteria

Many plant families include species that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that give roots a built-in source of fixed nitrogen for assimilation into organic compounds. Most of the research on symbiotic nitrogen fixation has focused on agriculturally important members of the legume family, including peas, beans, soybeans, peanuts, alfalfa, and clover. A legume's roots have swellings called nodules composed of plant cells that contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium ("root living"). Inside the nodule, Rhizobium bacteria assume a form called bacteroids, which are contained within vesicles formed by the root cell (FIGURE 37.10). Each legume is associated with a particular species of Rhizobium. FIGURE 37.11 describes the steps in the development of root nodules after bacteria enter through what is called an infection thread.

In this TEM, a cell from a root nodule of soybean is filled with bacteroids in vesicles. The cell on the left is uninfected.

The symbiotic relationship between a legume and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is mutualistic, with both partners benefiting. The bacteria supply the legume with fixed nitrogen, and the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. Most of the ammonium produced by symbiotic nitrogen fixation is used by the nodules to make amino acids, which are then transported to the shoot and leaves via the xylem.

Some root nodules have a reddish color owing to a molecule called leghemoglobin. Leghemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that, like the hemoglobin of human red blood cells, binds reversibly to oxygen (leg- is for legume). The root nodule's leghemoglobin acts as an oxygen "buffer," regulating the supply of oxygen for the intense respiration required by the bacteria to produce ATP for nitrogen fixation.

Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation and Agriculture

Now that you have learned about symbiotic nitrogen fixation, you can understand the agricultural practice of crop rotation. One year a nonlegume such as corn is planted, and the following year alfalfa or some other legume is planted to restore the concentration of fixed nitrogen in the soil. Instead of being harvested, the legume crop is often plowed under so that it will decompose as "green manure" (FIGURE 37.12). To ensure that the legume encounters its specific Rhizobium, the seeds are soaked in a culture of the bacteria or dusted with bacterial spores before sowing.

Fig 37-12. Crop rotation and "green manure." The "green manure" being mulched into the soil of this Washington State farm is sweet clover, a legume with root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Every third year, clover is planted and the crop is plowed under. This improves the physical structure and nitrogen content of the soil for growing wheat and other crops during the other two years of the crop rotation cycle. Crop rotation, especially when the legume is mulched instead of harvested, reduces the need for manufactured fertilizers.

Many plant families besides legumes include species that benefit from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. For example, alders and certain tropical grasses host nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the actinomycete group (see Chapter 27). Rice, a crop of great commercial importance, benefits indirectly from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Rice farmers culture a water fern called Azolla in their paddies. The fern has symbiotic cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen and increase the fertility of the rice paddy. The growing rice eventually shades and kills the Azolla, and decomposition of this organic material adds more nitrogenous minerals to the paddy.

The Molecular Biology of Root Nodule Formation in Legumes

How does a legume species recognize a certain species of Rhizobium among the many bacterial species inhabiting a root's soil environment? And how does an encounter with that specific Rhizobium lead to the development of a nodule? These two questions have led researchers to a chemical dialogue between the bacteria and the root, with each partner responding to the chemical signals from the other by expressing certain genes whose products contribute to nodule formation (FIGURE 37.13). The plant initiates the communication when its roots secrete molecules called flavonoids, which enter Rhizobium cells living in the vicinity of the roots. The specificity of this signal arises from variations in flavonoid structure, with a particular legume species secreting a type of flavonoid that only a certain Rhizobium species will detect and absorb. The plant's signal triggers the production of an answering molecule by the bacterium. Specifically, the plant's signal molecule activates a gene-regulating protein, which switches on a cluster of bacterial genes called nod, for "nodulation" genes. The products of these genes are enzymes that catalyze production of species-specific molecules called Nod factors. Secreted by the bacterial cells, the Nod factors return the "hello" and signal the root to form the infection thread the Rhizobium will enter and to begin forming the root nodule (see FIGURE 37.11). The plant's responses require activation of genes called early nodulin genes, probably by gene-regulating signal-transduction pathways, such as those you learned about in Chapter 11.

Researchers have analyzed the molecular structure of the Nod factors for clues to these bacterial molecules' ability to influence genes within the cells of a plant. An early discovery, puzzling at the time, was that Nod factors are very similar to chitins, the main substances in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of arthropods (see Chapter 5). But now there is evidence that plants themselves produce chitinlike substances that probably function as growth regulators. This discovery led to the hypothesis that Nod factors mimic certain plant growth regulators in stimulating the roots to grow new organs--nodules, in this case. Researchers have also learned that the plant genes that must be expressed for nodules to form are genes that also function in many other developmental processes in plants. This suggests that researchers might someday learn to induce Rhizobium uptake and nodule formation in crop plants that do not normally form such nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships. A more likely outcome of continued research, however, is that scientists will learn to manipulate the molecular biology of the root-Rhizobium relationships of legumes and other natural nodule formers to improve the efficiency of nitrogen fixation and protein production by crops.





 Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations of roots and fungi that enhance plant nutrition

Mycorrhizae ("fungus roots") are modified roots consisting of symbiotic associations of fungi and roots (see FIGURES 31.18 and 36.8). The symbiosis is mutualistic. The fungus benefits from a hospitable environment and a steady supply of sugar donated by the host plant. In return, the fungus increases the surface area for water uptake and selectively absorbs phosphate and other minerals from the soil and supplies them to the plant. The fungi of mycorrhizae also secrete growth factors that stimulate roots to grow and branch. And the fungi produce antibiotics that may help protect the plant from pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi in the soil.

Mycorrhizae are not oddities; they are formed by almost all plant species. In fact, this plant-fungus symbiosis might have been one of the evolutionary adaptations that made it possible for plants to colonize land in the first place; fossilized roots from some of the earliest plants include mycorrhizae (see Chapter 31). When terrestrial ecosystems were young, the soil was probably not very rich in nutrients. The fungi of mycorrhizae, which are more efficient at absorbing minerals than the roots themselves, would have helped nourish the pioneering plants. Even today, the plants that first become established on nutrient-poor soils, such as abandoned farmland or eroded hillsides, are usually well endowed with mycorrhizae.

The Two Main Types of Mycorrhizae

The modified roots formed from the symbiosis of fungi and plants take two major forms: ectomycorrhizae and endomy corrhizae. In ectomycorrhizae, the mycelium (mass of branching hyphae; see Chapter 31) forms a dense sheath, or mantle, over the surface of the root (FIGURE 37.14a). Hyphae extend from the mantle into the soil, greatly increasing the surface area for water and mineral absorption. Fungal hyphae also grow into the cortex of the root. These hyphae do not penetrate the root cells but form a network in the extracellular spaces that facilitates nutrient exchange between the fungus and the plant. Compared with "uninfected" roots, ectomycorrhizae are generally thicker, shorter, and more branched. Ectomycorrhizae do not form root hairs, which would be superfluous given the extensive surface area of the fungal mycelium. Ectomycorrhizae are especially common in woody plants, including trees of the pine, spruce, oak, walnut, birch, willow, and eucalyptus families.

In contrast to ectomycorrhizae, endomycorrhizae do not have a dense mantle ensheathing the root (FIGURE 37.14b). It takes a microscope to see the fine fungal hyphae that extend from the root into the soil. Hyphae also extend inward (hence the term endomycorrhizae) by digesting small patches of the root cell walls. A hypha does not actually pierce the plasma membrane and enter the cytoplasm of the host cell, but instead grows into a tube formed by invagination of the root cell's membrane. The action is analogous to poking a finger gently into a balloon; your finger is like the fungal hypha, and the skin of the balloon is like the plant cell's membrane. Once they have penetrated in this way, some of the fungal hyphae become highly branched to form dense knotlike structures called arbuscles. These arbuscles are important sites of nutrient transfer between the fungus and the plant. To the unaided eye, endomycorrhizae look like "normal" roots with root hairs, but a microscope reveals a symbiotic relationship of enormous importance to plant nutrition. Endomycorrhizae, much more common than ectomycorrhizae, are found in over 90%  of plant species, including important crop plants such as corn, wheat, and legumes.

Agricultural Importance of Mycorrhizae

Roots can be transformed into mycorrhizae only if they are exposed to the appropriate species of fungus. In most natural ecosystems, these fungi are present in soil, and seedlings develop mycorrhizae. But if seeds are collected in one environment and planted in foreign soil, the plants may show signs of malnutrition resulting from the absence of the plants' mycorrhizal partners. Researchers observe similar results in experiments in which soil fungi are poisoned. Farmers and foresters are already applying the lessons of such research. For example, inoculating pine seeds with spores of mycorrhizal fungi promotes the formation of mycorrhizae by the seedlings. Pine seedlings so infected grow more vigorously than trees without the fungal association.





 Mycorrhizae and root nodules may have an evolutionary relationship

There is growing evidence that the molecular biology of root nodule formation is closely related to mechanisms that evolved first in mycorrhizae. In 1997, researchers reported that the nodulin genes activated in the plant during the early stages of root nodule formation are the very same genes activated during the early development of endomycorrhizae. In fact, mutations in these early nodulin genes block development of both root nodules and mycorrhizae in legumes that form both structures. In addition, the signal-transduction pathways that relay messages from the microorganisms to the plant's gene-regulating equipment involved in the development of both root nodules and mycorrhizae may share at least some components. For example, experimental application of plant hormones called cytokinins to root cells of legumes activates expression of the early nodulin genes even in the absence of the bacterial or fungal symbionts. (You will learn more about cytokinins and other plant hormones in Chapter 39.) "Infection" by either the bacteria or fungi causes the concentration of cytokinins in root tissue to increase naturally. These experiments suggest that the hormone is one of the links between the "I'm here" announcement of the microbes and the changes in gene expression in the plant that lead to structural modification of the roots. Even the chemical cues from the two kinds of microbes may be similar. Recall that the Nod factors secreted by Rhizobium bacteria are related to chitins, the same compounds that make up the cell walls of fungi. A reasonable hypothesis is that root cells have a family of closely related receptors that detect their particular bacterial and fungal symbionts.

Mycorrhizae, as you have learned, evolved very early, probably over 400 million years ago in the earliest vascular plants. In contrast, the root nodules of legumes originated only 65-150 million years ago, during the early evolution of angiosperms. The recent experiments revealing common molecular mechanisms in roots' two major symbiotic relationships suggest that root nodule development is at least partly adapted from a signaling pathway that was already in place in mycorrhizae. This is one more example of how evolution can co-opt existing equipment for new functions.





 Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants

The mistletoe we find tacked above doorways during the holiday season lives in nature as a parasite on oaks and other trees. Mistletoe is photosynthetic, but it supplements its nutrition by using projections called haustoria to siphon xylem sap from the vascular tissue of the host tree. Some parasitic plants, such as dodder (FIGURE 37.15a), do not perform photosynthesis at all, drawing all their nutrients from other plants by tapping into the host's vascular tissue. In another version of parasitism, Indian pipe obtains its nutrients from trees indirectly via its association with fungal hyphae of the host tree's mycorrhizae (FIGURE 37.15b).

Plants called epiphytes (from the Greek epi, upon, and phyton, plant) are sometimes mistaken for parasites. An epiphyte is an autotrophic plant that nourishes itself but grows on the surface of another plant, usually on the branches or trunks of trees. An epiphyte is anchored to its living substratum, but it absorbs water and minerals mostly from rain that falls on its leaves. Examples of epiphytes are staghorn ferns, some mosses, Spanish moss (actually an angiosperm), and many species of bromeliads and orchids.





 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals

Living in acid bogs and other habitats where soil conditions are poor (especially in nitrogen) are plants that fortify themselves by occasionally feeding on animals. These carnivorous plants make their own carbohydrates by photosynthesis, but they obtain some of their nitrogen and minerals by killing and digesting insects and other small animals. Various kinds of insect traps have evolved by the modification of leaves (FIGURE 37.16). The traps are usually equipped with glands that secrete digestive juices. Fortunately for the animal kingdom, this ironic turnabout is a relatively rare exception to the standard ecosystem dynamics of animals eating plants!

Prey that enters the trap touches sensory hairs, initiating an electrical impulse that triggers closure of the trap. Glands in the trap then secrete digestive enzymes, and nutrients are later absorbed by the modified leaf. In spite of its name, the flytrap catches more ants and grasshoppers than it does flies. (b) Pitcher plants use a pitfall to capture insects. Insects slip into a long water-filled funnel. After the insect drowns, it is digested by enzymes secreted into the water.
