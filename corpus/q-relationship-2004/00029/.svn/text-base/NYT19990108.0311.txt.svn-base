Senior officials at CIA headquarters urged the station chief to reconsider , but they said the decision was ultimately his , and he held his ground .
There were no interviews .
Because the documents seized from the group 's offices showed no evidence of a bombing plot , the CIA soon dropped its investigation .
Without any evidence against Al - Haramain , the agency concluded that its informant was not credible , officials said .
Kenya washed its hands of the group , ordering the nine deported .
But some members of the counter-terrorism team were furious , officials said , and complained that their investigation had been dangerously short-circuited .
They felt they were unable to conduct a thorough investigation without talking to the suspects themselves .
Some team members blamed the decision on the station chief 's lack of field experience ; he was a career analyst from the CIA 's directorate of intelligence on his first overseas espionage assignment .
Embassy officials say they were not aware of the internal CIA dispute , and add that they assumed at the time that it was the Kenyans who had denied access to the suspects .
`` Why would you not want to interview them ? '' asked one State Department official .
Ms. Bushnell was told of the findings of the inquiry , and assured that the threat had been eliminated by the arrests .
In fact , there were some lingering questions .
Some intelligence officials believed at the time that members of the charity were tied to bin Laden .
It was , perhaps , another clue about possible terrorist activity in Kenya .
However , the CIA did not circulate any intelligence reports throughout the rest of the government about the case .
Today , intelligence officials insist there is no evidence linking the group to the embassy bombings .
But they say they now have evidence that connects them to bin Laden .
The agency 's inspector general is examining the case .
A third warning surfaced in November , 1997 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed , an Egyptian , walked into the embassy and told CIA officers he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck inside the diplomats ' underground parking garage</ENAMEX> .
In a separate interrogation by Kenyan security officials , which was relayed to the Americans , Ahmed made his own involvement in the plot clear , saying he had already taken surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack , which he said was to involve several vehicles and stun grenades .
The CIA issued two intelligence reports on Ahmed 's statements , but cautioned in its reports that Ahmed may have fabricated his story , thus downplaying the significance of the warning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">But Ahmed is now being held in jail in Tanzania in connection with the Dar es Salaam embassy bombing</ENAMEX> , and U.S. officials still are n't sure what to make of his 1997 warning .
The warnings in August and November prompted Ms. Bushnell to renew her case for a new embassy .
On December 15 , 1997 , she sent a report back to State Department headquarters warning that the embassy 's location made it `` extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack , '' and that it had to be replaced with a more secure building .
Less than two weeks later , on December 24th , she sent another cable noting again that `` the embassy 's security profile , in a congested , downtown location , is cause for serious concern , '' and asked for a comprehensive review of the embassy 's security status .
She also asked that State Department officials go back to Congress to ask for more money in order to fund a new Nairobi embassy .
Senior officials were not swayed , arguing that the dangers were nonexistent or already dissipated .
Ahmed 's warning , one senior official said , had been largely discounted as not credible .
The Kenyans had taken care of the more serious threat , he said , by arresting members of al- Haramain .
In a January 1998 budget review concerning embassy construction funding , which included Undersecretary of State for Management Bonnie Cohen and other senior officials , Ms. Bushnell 's request was not seriously considered , officials acknowledged .
In a response to her warnings of a worsening terrorist threat , in a January 1998 cable , Ms. Bushnell was told by headquarters that other embassy projects had priority , and that a new Nairobi embassy was not in the State Department 's future plans .
The cable said that headquarters agreed that a `` new chancery would be ideal , '' but that State `` had reviewed the case and understood her concerns '' and had turned her down .
In fact , the State Department had a long wish list of embassies it eventually wanted to replace , and Nairobi was not on it .
Congressional and State Department officials say that , prior to the August embassy bombings , State asked Congress to include funds in its fiscal 1999 budget for only two new embassies -- in Beijing and Berlin .
Those were the only new embassies the State Department had sought congressional funding for since at least fiscal 1996 .
Ms. Bushnell 's increasingly insistent demands for a new embassy were so far out of step with the State Department 's plans that officials at headquarters were beginning to see her as a nuisance who was obsessed by security , according to one official familiar with the matter .
