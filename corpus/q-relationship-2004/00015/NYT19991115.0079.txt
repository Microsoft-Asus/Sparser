-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- After the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , the United States accused Osama bin Laden , the Saudi -born construction tycoon , of financing terrorist camps in Somalia , Egypt , Sudan , Yemen , Egypt and Afghanistan .
A few days later , America fired cruise missiles at bin Laden 's camps in eastern Afghanistan , killing nearly 20 militants but leaving his network unharmed .
Washington demanded bin Laden 's extradition .
But the Taliban , who rule Afghanistan , refused to comply .
The Taliban emerged in late 1994 as a messianic movement made up of `` taliban '' -LRB- literally , students -RRB- from Islamic `` madrasahs '' -LRB- seminaries -RRB- who were living as refugees in Pakistan .
They vowed to bring peace to wartorn Afghanistan , establish law and order , disarm the population and impose `` sharia '' -LRB- Islamic law -RRB- .
Ever since , the nature of the Taliban -- who they are and what they represent -- has been difficult for outsiders to understand because of the excessive secrecy that surrounds their leaders and political structure .
The Taliban do not issue policy statements or hold regular press conferences .
There is no Taliban manifesto .
Because of the strict religious ban on photography and television , Afghans do not even know what their new leaders look like .
The one-eyed Taliban religious leader , Mullah Muhammad Omar , does not meet with non- Muslims and so remains a mystery .
Yet the Taliban 's purist ideology and the Pakistani recruits it has nurtured have had immense cross-border repercussions in Pakistan .
An already fragile nation in the midst of an identity crisis , economic meltdown , ethnic and sectarian division -- and a military regime that overthrew the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in October -- Pakistan could easily be submerged by a new fundamentalist wave led by neo- Taliban groups .
Indeed , Pakistan 's support for the Taliban is coming back to haunt it .
By 1998 , neo- Taliban parties had become a major influence in the Pakistani provinces of Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province .
In those regions , they had begun banning television and videos , imposing `` sharia '' punishments such as stoning and amputation , assassinating Pakistani Shiite Muslims and forcing women to adopt the restrictive Taliban dress code .
Their influence is now starting to creep elsewhere into Pakistan -- to Punjab and Sind .
Already in July the Jamiat -ul- Ulema -e- Islam -LRB- JUI -RRB- , a strongly anti- Western political party , issued death threats to all Americans in Pakistan , to be carried out if bin Laden is extradited to the United States .
Pakistan is reluctant to help the United States capture bin Laden , if only because it would create the appearance that Islamabad was seen to do Washington 's bidding .
The Saudi dilemma is even worse .
Saudi Arabia has helped finance the Taliban and has provided crucial military support for their offensives .
After the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa , the Saudis suspended diplomatic relations with the Taliban and ostensibly ceased all aid .
They did not , however , withdraw diplomatic recognition and private donations continue to flow .
Like Pakistan , Saudi Arabia would like to leave bin Laden in Afghanistan .
His arrest and trial in the United States could be highly embarrassing , exposing his continuing relationship with sympathetic members of the ruling elites and intelligence services of both countries .
Between 1994 and 1999 , an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan .
By now , the JUI and its many breakaway factions have become the main recruiters of Pakistani and foreign students to fight for the Taliban .
These battle-hardened militants now gravely threaten Pakistan 's own stability .
Moreover , the thousands of foreign radicals now fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan are determined to someday overthrow their own regimes and carry out Taliban -style revolutions in their homelands .
For example , the Chechnya -based militants who took over parts of Dagestan in July included in their ranks Arabs , Afghans and Pakistanis , most of whom had fought in the ' 80s Afghan holy war , or `` jihad , '' against the Soviets .
One of the main recruiters of Arab militants for the Afghan jihad was bin Ladin .
As the richest and highest-ranking Saudi to participate in the struggle , he was heavily patronized by both Pakistani and Saudi intelligence .
Bin Ladin left Afghanistan in 1990 but returned in May 1996 .
Striking up a friendship with Omar , the Taliban chief , bin Ladin moved to Omar 's base in Kandahar in early 1997 .
Bin Ladin reunited and rearmed the Arab militants still remaining in Afghanistan after the war against the Soviets , creating the `` 055 '' brigade .
The Taliban had no contact with Arab Afghans or pan- Islamic ideology until then .
But Omar was quickly influenced by his new friend and became increasingly vociferous in his attacks on Americans , the United Nations and the Saudis and other pro- Western Muslim regimes .
Recent Taliban statements reflect a bin Ladin -style outrage , defiance and pan- Islamism that the Taliban had never used before his arrival .
By now U.S. officials claim that , with most of his bank accounts frozen , bin Laden finances his operations through opium .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Afghanistan now produces three times more opium than the rest of the world put together .
Ninety -six percent of it is cultivated in Taliban -controlled areas , making the Taliban the largest heroin producer in the world .
The U.N. Drug Control Program reports that Afghanistan produced 4,600 metric tons of opium in 1999 -- twice as much as in the previous year .
And the Taliban collect a 20 percent tax from opium dealers and transporters -- money that goes straight to the Taliban war chest .</ENAMEX>
Drug dealers operate the only banking system in Afghanistan -- offering farmers credit in advance of their poppy crop .
This criminalized economy has weakened states throughout the region .
More and more , chaos in Afghanistan is seeping through its porous borders .
Its ongoing civil war has polarized the region , with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia backing the Taliban , while Iran , Russia , India and four former Soviet Central Asian republics support the opposition Northern Alliance .
The confrontation is producing enormous economic disruption throughout the area , as the Afghan warlords ' dependence on smuggling and drug trafficking grows insatiable .
A 1999 World Bank study estimates that the smuggling trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan alone amounted to $ 2.5 billion in 1997 , equivalent to more than half of Afghanistan 's estimated gross domestic product .
Add to that the smuggling to and from the rest of the region and the total rises to $ 5 billion .
This smuggling has crippled local industry in all the affected states ; local factories cannot compete with smuggled , foreign-made , duty-free consumer goods .
The smuggling also creates huge losses in customs revenue and sales taxes .
According to Pakistan 's Central Board of Revenue , Pakistan 's losses in 1998 amounted to 30 percent of the government 's total revenues of $ 6 billion .
The Taliban tax on the smuggling trade was its second-largest source of income after drugs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Whereas Afghan opium was exported to the West through Pakistan in the 1980s , there are now multiple export routes through Iran , the Persian Gulf states and Central Asia .
As these routes expand , so do the beneficiaries .</ENAMEX>
New transport and smuggling mafias have developed in Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Iran .
They are ignored by their governments , due to a web of corruption that benefits everyone from border guards to cabinet ministers .
Not surprisingly , all these transport mafias are keen supporters and major funders of the Taliban .
And this illegal economy is only expanding , since Afghanistan 's formal one remains nonexistent .
The Afghan infrastructure is devastated , health care and education are virtually absent , and abject poverty is rampant .
Afghanistan today has six working factories , compared to 220 in 1979 .
Fighting and smuggling offer the only employment .
Meanwhile , Washington 's sole response so far has been its single-minded obsession with bringing to justice the now-legendary bin Laden -- hardly a comprehensive policy for dealing with this increasingly volatile part of the world .
