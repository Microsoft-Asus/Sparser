CELL SURFACES AND JUNCTIONS

 

 Plant cells are encased by cell walls



 

 The extracellular matrix (ECM) of animal cells functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation



 

 Intercellular junctions help integrate cells into higher levels of structure and function



 

 The cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts



Having crisscrossed the interior of the cell to explore various organelles, we complete our tour of the cell by returning to the surface of this microscopic world, where there are additional structures with important functions. Although the plasma membrane is usually regarded as the boundary of the living cell, most cells synthesize and secrete coats of one kind or another that are external to the plasma membrane.
