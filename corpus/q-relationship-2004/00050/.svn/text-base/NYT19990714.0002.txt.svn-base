SAN LUIS RIO COLORADO , Sonora --
A furious weekend shootout between Mexican police and a gang of suspected drug traffickers put this normally placid border town on edge , prompting its mayor to seek the help of federal troops if violence erupts again .
Three smuggling suspects died , and four other people , three of them city police officers , were wounded during a fusillade in a vacant lot only blocks from the Arizona border .
`` Inevitably , there 's a sense of worry , '' Mayor Florencio Diaz Armenta said Tuesday .
`` Our citizens do n't understand who is responsible for what .
There are tensions because there are people dead , and state authorities are looking for suspects . ''
During the roughly 10 minutes that bullets were flying , one of the bandits tossed a fragmentation grenade into the melee , but it failed to explode , Assistant Police Chief Santiago Huizar Rubio said .
A 14-year -old boy , who was not identified , was passing by the area when the violence started .
Huizar Rubio said he was wounded along with the three officers .
All are expected to live .
U.S. law enforcement officials , who are used to battling the steady flow of drugs and associated crime along the border , say the extremity of Sunday 's violence was surprising .
Roughly two dozen men armed with AK -47s opened fire on police .
There were reports that the fragmentation device was fired from a grenade launcher .
Law enforcement agents on both sides of the border were still scrambling Tuesday to make sense of the outburst and to learn more about an alleged drug kingpin whom Mexican authorities identified as Gil Amarillas .
Huizar Rubio said Amarillas was identified as the boss of a drug smuggling operation by some of those involved in Sunday 's shootout .
He said the organization is thought to be based in San Luis , because most of those killed or arrested were native to the area .
Meanwhile , police in southern Yuma County were alerted to watch for suspects from the shootout trying to cross into the United States .
Local and federal agencies in Arizona also put two of the three wounded Mexican officers under protection in Arizona hospitals and whisked the officers ' immediate families to hideouts north of the border after threats were made on their lives , said Ernesto Lugo , a police officer in San Luis , Ariz .
`` There is a lot of drug activity , yes , '' Lugo said .
`` But for it to get this violent , especially against police , is very unusual . ''
Lugo , the department 's liaison with Mexican law enforcement , said authorities know little about Gil Amarillas and his gang .
As Mexican federal police , or Federales , took over the investigation , police fanned out through the city Monday and Tuesday seeking suspects and drugs .
Huizar Rubio said officers raided 15 homes , arresting 10 suspects .
He declined to release their names .
Huizar Rubio also declined to name those killed .
`` El Independiente , '' a newspaper published in Hermosillo , on Tuesday listed the dead as Alberto Velazco Ojeda and Jesus Armando Alcantar , both of San Luis , and Hector Madrid Amarillas , from Mexicali in Baja California .
The injured officers were identified as Ramon Ramos , who was hospitalized in Mexico with a bullet wound to the stomach ; Guillermo Arreola , hospitalized in Arizona with leg and foot wounds ; and Israel Avendano Parra , hospitalized in Arizona with a head wound and symptoms of a heart attack .
According to municipal police , Sunday 's deadly fray started with the arrest of a man in his early 20s for speeding through town .
The speeder was jailed but paid a fine and was released Saturday .
Early Sunday , the suspect and his friends , armed with assault rifles , found the arresting officer and confronted him .
The police officer was roughed up and threatened , but he escaped .
Thugs next went to the home of the officer 's parents and threatened his family .
Huizar Rubio said a 36-man security force was being assembled when police learned about armed men in a vacant lot just east of the city 's heart .
As patrol units arrived , they were met with gunfire .
Huizar Rubio said it was an ambush , and the cross-fire continued as reinforcements were called in .
By Tuesday , a bullet-riddled wall was the only remaining evidence .
Cars cruised by with occupants gawking at the damage .
Across the street , at the Motel Continental , it was business as usual .
One of those stopping to take in the sight was Jose Lopez Beltran , a San Luis native who was angry at police for engaging the gang in a gunfight with so many innocent people nearby .
`` They really should n't put people in danger , '' Lopez Beltran said , adding that he 'd never seen that kind of violence in the past .
Other bystanders and workers in nearby businesses were reluctant to discuss the shootings , fearful of reprisals .
But Augustin Diaz , a San Luis cabdriver who frequently cruises through the neighborhood , said people are scared .
`` People are afraid to talk about it .
They do n't know what will happen .
It could happen again . ''
Sunday 's hail of bullets was not the city 's first .
In 1997 , Benjamin Flores , editor of the local newspaper , `` La Prensa , '' was gunned down for his journalistic crusade against drug trafficking in the region .
Several other less-publicized killings took place in the city during that period , as Mexico 's powerful drug cartels battled for control of smuggling turf .
However , city officials maintain that San Luis , a bustling commercial center in an agricultural region , has been safe ever since .
