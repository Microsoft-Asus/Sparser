Jiang Zemin proposed that the two sides , as a first step , hold talks `` under the principle of one China , formally putting an end to hostilities across the Taiwan Straits '' .
He suggested that the two sides then do their duties in safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and make plans for the further development of relations across the straits .
He emphasized that `` political differences should not influence or interfere in economic cooperation across the straits '' and that `` steps should be taken for the realization of direct mail , shipping and air links '' between the two sides .
Jiang 's speech was widely praised and well received by the people inside and outside China .
In the past five years , the NPC Standing Committee and State Council departments have issued major provisions and regulations on Taiwan .
And visitors have been increasing in number .
In 1996 alone , 1.72 million Taiwan residents visited the interior areas of China .
The development of relations across the straits and a peaceful reunification of the motherland have become a historical trend .
It is reasonable to think that the CPC , which has successfully resumed the excercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong , will be able to lead the Chinese nation to another victory in the coming century .
China 's success in solving the Hong Kong issue by using the principle of `` one country , two systems '' will certainly have a profound impact on the return of Macao to the motherland and the sovling of the Taiwan issue .
