SEOUL , April 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea will allow its companies to give or rent machinery to the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK -RRB- , Minister for Unification Kang In -duk said Friday .
The government will abolish the ban of five-million U.S. dollar investment in the North , Kang told the Korea Federation of Industries .
`` We will also allow companies to barter with fertilizer and contract joint agricultural projects , '' he said .
Kang said the heads of large businesses and leaders of economic organizations will be allowed to visit the North .
The minister 's remarks were seen as a reaffirmation of the government 's policy of separating economic cooperation from political issues with the DPRK although the South - North vice-ministerial level talks in Beijing failed to reach an agreement last week over the issue of food and fertilizer assistance .
The remarks were also believed to be an apparent response to the demand made by Korea Federation of Small Business Chairman Park Sang -hee and Daewoo Chairman Kim Woo -choong to visit the North .
The government has already allowed Chung Ju -yung , founder of Hyundai Group , to visit the North .
In his inauguration speech in February , South Korean President Kim Dae -jung said the inter- Korean relations must be based on reconciliation and cooperation .
