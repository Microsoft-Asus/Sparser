CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Libya 's foreign minister has dismissed as a joke a decision this week by the Arab League to respect a six-year U.N. ban on flights to or from Libya .
The minister , Omar al- Muntasser , said the decision falls short of a stand by African countries to ignore the embargo imposed on Libya to force it to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , Egypt 's Middle East News Agency said Friday .
The Arab League said Thursday that it would break the sanctions as soon as the United States , Britain and Libya agree on measures to put the two Libyan suspects on trial in the Netherlands .
Until then , its member countries should adhere to the embargo .
`` The decision ... by the Arab League , with regard to Lockerbie , is a joke , '' al- Muntasser was quoted as saying by the agency .

Since then , several African leaders have flown to the Libyan capital , Tripoli .
