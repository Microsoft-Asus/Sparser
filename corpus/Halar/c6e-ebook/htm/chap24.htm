The islands are named for the giant tortoises, such as the</span> Geochelone elephantopus <span class="Emphasis1">shown above, that are among the unique inhabitants</span>. (Gal&aacute;pago <span class="Emphasis1">is the Spanish word for tortoise.) After visiting the Gal&aacute;pagos, Darwin wrote in his diary: "Both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact--that mystery of mysteries--the first appearance of new beings on this Earth." The beginning of new forms of life--the origin of species--is at the focal point of evolutionary theory, for it is in new species that biological diversity arises. It is not enough to explain how adaptations evolve in populations, a topic covered in Chapter 23. Evolutionary theory must also explain <span class="Emphasis2">macroevolution,</span> the origin of new taxonomic groups (new species, new genera, new families, even new kingdoms). <span class="Emphasis2">Speciation</span> (the origin of new species) is the key process because any genus, family, or higher taxon originates with a new species that is novel enough to be the inaugural member of the higher taxon</span>.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The fossil record chronicles two patterns of speciation: anagenesis and cladogenesis (</span><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.1</span><span class="Emphasis1">).
