<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday met with former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and pledged to carry out earlier promises to improve ties .
`` We have good relations and I 'm sure that ... the specific proposals we signed will be carried out , '' Yeltsin told reporters after the meeting in a reference to agreements he signed with Hashimoto during previous meetings .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Yeltsin and Hashimoto developed friendly relations during two informal summits , one in Russia last November and one in Japan in April .
The meetings were hailed as a breakthrough in relations strained by a territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands off the southern Japanese coast .</ENAMEX>
The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally ending World War II , mainly because of a disagreement over control of the islands , claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the end of the war .
Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named special foreign policy advisor by his successor , Keizo Obuchi .
Obuchi , who served as foreign minister under Hashimoto , said last month that he wanted to sign a peace treaty and normalize relations with Russia by 2000 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hashimoto 's visit to Russia is paving the way for one by Obuchi scheduled for November , the first official trip to Moscow by a Japanese prime minister since 1973 .</ENAMEX>
