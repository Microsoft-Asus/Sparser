 Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds

Organisms are composed of matter, which is anything that takes up space and has mass.* Matter exists in many diverse forms, each with its own characteristics. Rocks, metals, oils, gases, and you and I are just a few examples of what seems an endless assortment of matter.

Some of the ancient Greek philosophers believed that the great variety of matter arises from four basic ingredients, or elements. They believed these elements to be air, water, fire, and earth--supposedly pure substances that could not be decomposed to other forms of matter. All other substances were thought to be formed by blending various proportions of two or more of the elements. Although these ancient philosophers proposed the wrong elements, their basic idea was correct.

An element is a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions. Today, chemists recognize 92 elements occurring in nature; gold, copper, carbon, and oxygen are examples. Each element has a symbol, usually the first letter or two of its name. Some of the symbols are derived from Latin or German names; for instance, the symbol for sodium is Na, from the Latin word natrium.

A compound is a substance consisting of two or more elements combined in a fixed ratio. Table salt, for example, is sodium chloride (NaCl), a compound composed of the elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) in a 1:1 ratio. Pure sodium is a metal and pure chlorine is a poisonous gas. Chemically combined, however, sodium and chlorine form an edible compound. This is a simple example of organized matter having emergent properties: A compound has characteristics beyond those of its combined elements (FIGURE 2.2).
