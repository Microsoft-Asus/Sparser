The cause of the disease has not been determined .
Similar diseases affect man , cats and other animals , and it is suspected that it has some link with their food intake .
Villeda Bermudez , a veterinarian , said that the main symptoms of the `` mad cow '' disease are loss of appetite , trembling , irritability and kicking .
Thousands of Hondurans have adopted vegetarianism as a lifestyle , some of them to follow Buddhism currents , now fashionable here , others to improve their health , but most of them did so because of the high cost of meat in the country .
