If America 's drug war is not already lost , it is clearly un winnable .
Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners through catclaw canyons west of Naco .
Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales ' ports of entry , using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for cocaine and cash .
Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San Luis Rio Colorado , the smug gler doing time in a federal penitentiary , the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix .
After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop illegal drug smuggling , the casualty count is a litany of lives wasted , tax dollars lost , corruption , vio lence and public cynicism .
Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year career of drug busting .
Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey , oversaw Drug Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed federal drug enforcement in Arizona .
`` Here it is today , '' he says , shaking his head , `` and there 's not much difference in drug trafficking ... except there 's more of it . ''
WHAT WENT WRONG ?
President Lyndon B. Johnson , faced with an explosion in casual drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s , launched the first big offensive in the nation 's drug war .
He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968 , hoping that a powerful new federal effort could eliminate the scourge .
But the drug trade and related crime only flourished .
A few years later , President Nixon shifted the focus from enforcement to treatment .
Fed eral spending on drug treatment , rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment during Nixon 's first term .
But interest waned after Nix on 's 1972 re-election , and tough new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal enforcement powers .
Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward spiral .
Even then , some saw the writ ing on the wall .
A Ford Founda tion study in the early 1970s concluded that `` the criminal-law approach appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem , as is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use , by everyone 's calculation , is increasing and shows no sign of leveling off . ''
More than two decades later , Henry Hinton , assistant comp troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in the General Accounting Office , offered a nearly identical assess ment to Congress : `` Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures of billions of dollars , illegal drugs still flood the United States . ''
THE ARIZONA BULGE America 's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the squeezing of a balloon .
Fif teen years ago , anti-smuggling operations pressed in on southern Florida , pushing smugglers to ward America 's 2,000-mile South western border .
Then in the 1990s , authorities targeted San Diego and Texas .
This time , the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona 's southern edge .
For three years , at least , it has been one of the world 's busiest dope corridors .
There 's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon State every year .
There 's not even a composite tally of all the smuggled drugs that are caught .
But , certainly , it 's more than ever .
Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal law enforcement agencies in the state .
The DEA , the U.S. Customs Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of pot in Arizona last year , twice the amount reported by the same agencies in 1995 .
The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies last year , although not a record , was up slightly from the year before .
Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at 53 pounds .
But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in 1999 by the DEA , the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking in Arizona .
In the past year alone , drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed in Naco and Nogales , $ 891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas port , and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at Lukeville .
But no matter how large the busts or how many , only an estimated one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United States are caught .
`` When you think about how many people they 're catching and how much has gotten through all these years , they are n't slowing anybody down , '' said David Alvarez , a federal public defender in Tucson .
DEMAND FOR DRUGS The drug war cost the United States $ 17.7 billion this year , up from $ 1.5 billion in 1981 and $ 102 million in 1970 .
One -third goes for treatment , education and prevention , compared with nearly 60 percent in the early ' 70s .
But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in the black market .
Instead , the cost of catching a pound of dope just keeps going up .
A decade ago , the U.S. government spent less than $ 3,500 for every pound of heroin , cocaine , marijuana and hashish seized .
By last year , the average was up over $ 5,000 a pound .
The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of the border .
A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending nearly $ 50 billion on their illegal drug habits .
A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6 million Americans , or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older , were using illicit drugs , down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually unchanged from 1991 .
Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse , and the trend among those ages 12 to 17 is troubling .
About one in 10 has been using drugs regularly dur ing the past several years , up from one in 17 or 18 during the early part of the decade .
The problem is particularly acute in Arizona , where teenag ers have a higher abuse rate , 14.4 percent , than the national average of 9.9 .
percent .
EASY MONEY ?
Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for $ 14,500 to $ 20,000 .
Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can pick up $ 400 to $ 600 .
Anthony P. Maingot , a sociolo gist who researched the world wide drug economy , estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more than $ 1 trillion .
The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when such enormous amounts of money are at stake .
Consider Billy Martin : The one-time Douglas schoolkid , the son of middle-class parents , is accused by federal prosecutors of cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking ring that raked in more than $ 19 million over five years .
Mar tin fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s , but last year was sent back to the United States to stand trial .
Sworn statements from Mar tin 's confederates offer glimpses of the insane profitability of their ventures .
The affidavits speak of a courier , code-named Slim , who regularly met a New York City drug buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia .
The buyer `` delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994 , never less than $ 300,000 . ''
Slim , who earned $ 5,000 per trip , `` sometimes traveled with an exotic looking female ... strik ingly beautiful , '' letting her carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag .
Sometimes , couriers flew west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air .
A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that Martin 's home in Mexico was `` like a palace . ''
`` There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine guns , '' she said .
The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn only about $ 25 a week .
Even those at the bottom of the chain , the human mules who risk their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages they could n't hope to match in Mexico 's legal economy .
Blame to go around Lionel De Gunther , a student and teacher at the University of So nora in Hermosillo , said U.S. officials see only one side of the tragedy : their own .
But while drugs go north , decadence and crime , he said , flow south .
Hermosillo , a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix , has been transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband , green backs , guns and gangs from Arizona .
Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger , then discover a better high with cocaine and money .
Radio stations play corridos , or ballads , in honor of narco-lords .
In Juarez , the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso , citizens have lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this decade .
This winter , U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped and killed by the Jua rez Cartel .
`` Mexico is the diving board for drugs , and the United States is the swimming pool where they land , '' De Gunther said .
No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals , they could not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers , said Adolfo Garcia Morales , assistant state prosecutor for Sonora .
`` The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer , '' Garcia Mo rales said .
`` If we attack the causes , it will be much cheaper and much more effective . ''
Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to their country or culture .
But they are not naive about it .
Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation 's fab ric , creating a narco-democracy , a country whose institutions are increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances .
`` One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of dollars in profits per week , '' the U.S. General Accounting Office reported 18 months ago .
`` Profits of such magnitude enable the drug traffickers to pay enormous bribes , estimated for one organi zation to be as much as $ 1 million per week , to Mexican law en forcement officials at the fed eral , state and local levels . ''
Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials ; witness the brib ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last year .
But if America 's enforcement machine is flawed , Mexico 's is so compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any one across the border .
Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can troops and federal police are protecting drug loads , not seizing them .
Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder .
In 1997 , Mexico 's drug czar , Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , was exposed for aiding traffick ers he 'd pledged to exterminate .
More recently , Operation Casa blanca , a three-year undercover money laundering probe , proved `` enlightening ... as to the depth of deception and corruption in the Mexican system , '' said for mer Customs Agent William F. Gately , who led the investigation .
Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of three major Mexican banks .
Gately insists the operation might eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in laundering $ 1 billion in drug profits .
Gately never got the chance to find out .
The Clinton administra tion , voicing diplomatic concerns , halted the operation in 1998 .
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting without its knowledge .
When there 's not diplomacy to consider , there 's trade .
Every year , U.S. presidents preserve Mexico 's trade status by certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting `` favored nation , '' despite ample evidence to the contrary .
And the North American Free Trade Agreement , which knocked down commerce barriers be tween countries , often pits anti-smuggling efforts against U.S. business and political interests .
The 6-year -old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and trade .
But law enforcement agencies ca n't keep pace , and efforts to tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and politicians .
`` NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement because that 's what it 's become , '' Gately said .
New approaches Those closest to the struggle say they 're tired of the way America is waging its drug war .
They say it 's time to get tough .
Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for eign aid to Mexico .
Others want undercover investigations that reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels .
Some support sending special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper ations .
Reform advocates , on the other hand , say the only answer is to combat drug abuse .
`` We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in the drug war , when the problem is right here at home , '' said Gail Rittenhouse , an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons , where up to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems .
`` What if we spent at least half of that money on treatment , educa tion and prevention ? ''
Stephen Ralls , a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent , said the government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions .
So they hire more cops , pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build more prisons .
`` There is no education for young kids , '' he said .
`` There are no signature programs for the people who use drugs . ''
U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence and anti-crime zeal .
Americans demand that drug users be ar rested , unless it 's their kids .
They support long prison sentences for smugglers , then cringe at the costs .
Some , like New Mexico 's Gov. Gary Johnson , have come to believe the only solution is the legalization of some drugs .
`` Control it , tax it , regulate it , get control of a product that is black-market , '' Johnson said .
In the past 20 years , drug use declined by half while the annual cost of the fight went from $ 1 billion to $ 17 billion .
By that math , Johnson argues , it will take $ 40 billion and 3.2 million arrests to cut use by half again .
`` As a cost-benefit analysis , this really stinks , '' Johnson said .
By his own admission , Johnson is a voice in the political wilder ness .
But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug policies in a new direction .
Voters in several states , includ ing Arizona , have passed initia tives approving marijuana for medical use .
This year , another initiative could be on Arizona 's ballot to decriminalize the use of smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug offenses .
Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically unpalatable to most Americans .
No war at all Gen. Barry McCaffrey , Clinton 's drug czar , is n't ready to surren der the drug war .
What needs to change , he said , is the terminology .
`` This metaphor , ` war on drugs , ' has gotten us into a lot of problems , '' said McCaffrey , a decorated former Army general who now heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
`` I understand war , and this ai n't no war .
If it 's a war , then we expect to achieve total victory through violence and deception . ''
McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as `` a cancer affecting our community life . ''
`` You do n't talk in terms of a cure , but you talk in terms of a five-year survival rate , '' he said .
By that standard , he says , federal drug policies have suc ceeded : Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979 , and cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years .
The drug czar would have a tough time , however , convincing border narco-warriors that things are getting better .
Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those standing in their way .
Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix .
And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the cancer .
Consider Ronald `` Joe '' Borane , who spent a lifetime rising from Douglas cop to police chief to judge .
In an interview last sum mer , he told of putting hundreds of drug smugglers and dealers behind bars .
After 44 years in the drug war , Borane allowed that U.S. inter diction efforts are as useless as `` kicking sand at the tide . ''
One month after that inter view , Borane was indicted on money laundering charges stem ming from an FBI sting .
Accord ing to court records , an undercover agent coaxed the judge into a deal that involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for pot and coke .
The ex-cop and ex-judge now faces trial and , if convicted , prison time with the very people he once pursued from the other side of the law .
No wonder those left fighting the drug war question how much good they 're doing .
`` We 're not going to win it with law enforcement , '' said Kermit Miller , a Tucson police narcotics captain and leader in southern Arizona 's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area , a task force of law enforcement agencies .
`` We 're just a stopgap .
We 're holding the line . ''
