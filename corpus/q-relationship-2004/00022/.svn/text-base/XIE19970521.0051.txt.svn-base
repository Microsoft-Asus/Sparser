-LRB- by Wang Nengbiao -RRB- LUSAKA , May 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The refugee problem is a big headache to African countries , but they are making their efforts to cure it .
Of the 26 million people across the world who come under the concern of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- , more than nine million are Africans , accounting for 35 percent of the total .
Among the people are refugees and others in a similar situation , as well as returnees and certain groups of people displaced within the borders of their own country .
Of the about 13 million refugees throughout the world , 5.6 million are Africans , constituting 42 percent of the total .
In addition to these refugees in the continent , there are 1.3 million internally displaced persons -LRB- IDPs -RRB- and two million returnees who are still under the concern of UNHCR .
Most African countries have become ones of asylum and some of them are countries of origin as well as asylum .
So far 1.7 million Rwandan refugees remain in Burundi , Tanzania , Uganda and Zaire , 750,000 Liberian refugees in Guinea , Cote Ivoire , Ghana and Nigeria , 446,000 Somali refugees in Djibouti , Ethiopia , Kenya and Yemen , 424,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda , Zaire , Kenya and Ethiopia , 324,000 Angolan refugees in Zaire , Zambia , Congo and Namibia , and 320,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia .
Since the war broke out in Zaire , 300,000 refugees , including the Rwandan and Burundi refugees who fled to the country earlier , have fled from the war-torn country .
Armed border conflicts between countries over territorial disputes , civil wars and internal ethnic feuds are root causes leading to the influx of the African refugees .
Ethnic conflicts often break out in such countries as Rwanda and Burundi .
More than 700,000 Burundi refugees fled to Rwanda , Tanzania and Zaire in 1993 when a bloody ethnic conflict broke out .
500,000 Tutsis were massacred by Hutus in a short period of several months in that year .
After Tutsis defeated the government led by Hutus , about two million Hutus fled to the neighboring countries in fear of retaliation .
So far 1.7 million Burundi refugees remain in the neighboring countries including Zaire .
Howerver , African countries have been making great efforts to remove the root causes of the refugee problem .
Since the civil war broke out in Zaire in October in 1996 , Kenyan President Denial arap Moi has sponsored three regional summits , the Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- held a special summit in March this year and central African countries also held a regional summit to try to seek a peaceful solution to the fighting .
The OAU as well as Kenya , Uganda , Zambia and Tanzania have been striving to help realize ethnic reconciliation in another Great Lakes country of Burundi .
The annual OAU summit to be held next month will also discuss the refugee problem and try to seek a last solution to it .
Once wars end , situation stabilizes in African countries , both the countries of origin and asylum coordinate their efforts under the international assistance to repatriate and resettle the refugees .
In 1995 alone , 240,400 Rwandan refugees returned to their home country from Uganda , Zaire , Burundi and Tanzania , 159,000 Mozambican refugees were repatriated voluntarily from Zimbabwe and South Africa , 35,200 Ethiopian refugees from Djibouti , Sudan and Kenya as well as 21,500 Eritrean refugees from Sudan .
Although a lot of the African countries face shortages of drinking water , food , firewood and medicines , they provide as much assistance as possible for refugees .
Zambia , although poor , has accommodated 13,000 refugees from neighboring countries .
A three-man joint team of the OAU and UNHCR praised Zambia for caring and accommodating more than 3,000 Zairean refugees despite its economic and financial constraints after touring recently Maheba refugee camp in North - Western Province of the country .
In the camp , farming is the main pre-occupation , the refugees are living a normal life and bringing up children , some of whom are attending school .
The team expressed its satisfaction with the development plan of the refugee camp , and pledged to sell the idea in other parts of Africa .
