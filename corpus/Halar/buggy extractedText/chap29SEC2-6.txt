 Adaptations to shallow water preadapted plants for living on land

Many species of charophycean algae inhabit shallow waters around the edges of ponds and lakes, where they are subject to occasional drying. In such environments, natural selection favors individual algae that can survive through periods when they are not completely submerged in water. A layer of sporopollenin prevents exposed charophycean zygotes from drying out until they are in water again. This chemical adaptation may have been the precursor to the tough spore walls so important to the terrestrial survival of plants. Such adaptations accumulated by at least one population of charophyceans enabled their descendants--the first plants--to live permanently above the waterline. The evolutionary novelties of these first land plants opened an expanse of terrestrial habitat previously occupied only by films of bacteria. The new frontier was spacious, the bright sunlight was unfiltered by water and algae, the atmosphere had an abundance of carbon dioxide, the soil was rich in mineral nutrients, and, at least at first, there were relatively few herbivores and pathogens. But these environmental benefits only became available with the evolution of the adaptations that enable plants to survive and reproduce on land, a very different place than the aquatic habitats of the ancestral algae.
