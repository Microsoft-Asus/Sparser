THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO ECOLOGY

 

 Trophic relationships determine the routes of energy flow and chemical cycling in an ecosystem



 

 Decomposition connects all trophic levels



 

 The laws of physics and chemistry apply to ecosystems



Ecosystem ecologists view ecosystems as energy machines and matter processors. By grouping the species in a community into trophic levels of feeding relationships, we can follow the transformation of energy in the whole ecosystem and map the movements of chemical elements as they are used by the biotic community. As we discussed in Chapter 53, ecologists divide species into trophic levels on the basis of their main source of nutrition and energy.
