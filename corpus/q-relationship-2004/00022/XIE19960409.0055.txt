GENEVA , April 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Fighting in the west African state of Liberia could hit the United Nations ' repatriation plan for some 730,000 Liberian refugees , the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- said Tuesday .
`` UNHCR is extremely concerned about the new breakout of fighting in Liberia , specifically in and around Monrovia , '' UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told a news conference .
`` We fear this could pose a major setback to UNHCR 's plans for the repatriation over the next 18 months of some 730,000 Liberian refugees , who are in neighboring countries . ''
Fighting broke out in the capital Monrovia on April 6 after government forces tried to arrest former government minister , Roosevelt Johnson , leader of the ULIMO - J faction .
The fresh fighting could shatter the already fragile confidence of refugees about the security situation in the country , where a peace accord was signed last August , ending a six-year civil war in which some 150,000 people died .
Following the signing of the peace accord , some 30,000 refugees returned spontaneously , but mainly to border areas near Guinea and Cote d 'Ivoire , where the situation was safer than inland .
There are about 410,000 Liberian refugees in Guinea , 305,800 in Cote d 'Ivoire , 15,000 in Ghana , 4,700 in Sierra Leone and 4,000 in Nigeria .
Redmond said UNHCR favors a quick start to the repatriation plan , but that depends on the deployment of West African peacekeepers , progress in disarmament and demobilization of troops , and the extension of areas under the control of the central government .
In addition , UNHCR worries that the renewed fighting will increase difficulties in winning financial support for the 18-month repatriation program .
Some 60 million U.S. dollars are needed to implement the program but UNHCR has only 5.1 million dollars in hand .
The spokesman said that UNHCR is also concerned about some 120,000 Sierra Leonean refugees , most of whom are in camps in the Liberian capital Monrovia , although no major security problems have been reported so far .
He added that UNHCR is also providing assistance to some of the estimated 800,000 Internally Displaced Persons -LRB- IDPs -RRB- in and around Monrovia , where the prewar population was only about 500,000 .
The total number of IDPs is now about 1.2 million .
