WASHINGTON --
The Clinton administration announced Wednesday that it was relaxing export controls for encryption software used by several industries , including certain medical , insurance and online commerce companies .
The announcement , made at the White House by Vice President Al Gore , is another concession to industry and even some agencies within the federal government that have been pushing the administration to relax export controls on data-scrambling technologies , despite the Justice Department 's insistence that controls remain tight .
In July , the administration relaxed controls on the exports of encryption technology to banks and other financial institutions in 45 approved countries , and Tuesday 's announcement added the new industry sectors to that list .
Deputy White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the decision , made after extensive consultation with industry , was not the last word in the long and contentious debate over encryption between the government and industry .
`` Over the course of the next year , we will determine what further updates are necessary , '' he said .
Business executives and industry groups welcomed the announcement but said more was needed .
`` It 's a step in the right direction , but I hope it 's not the end of the discussion , '' said Doug McGowen , who manages encryption hardware and software issues for Hewlett - Packard Co. And Jerry Berman , executive director of the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology , complained that `` The administration is giving us half a loaf in the encryption debate . ''
Under the new administration program , any company is free to export less sophisticated 56-bit data-scrambling programs with few restrictions .
In addition , they can export even the most sophisticated encryption technologies to their own subsidiaries abroad .
Insurance companies as well as health and other medical organizations -- excluding biomedical and pharmaceutical companies -- are freed from the most stringent export controls .
So are online merchants involved in electronic transactions with other online merchants in the 45 approved countries .
Other exports will continue to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis .
