WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- His ban on U.S. surveillance planes is considered a boon for drug traffickers .
He is Fidel Castro 's baseball buddy and cites Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as a role model .
At another time , with another country , the United States might have taken a hard line against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a former paratrooper who was once imprisoned after leading a failed coup .
Instead , it has proceeded with caution .
It characterizes relations as close , shrugs off Chavez 's overtures to U.S. adversaries and quietly works to resolve differences .
Analysts say the delicate U.S. approach has much to do with Chavez 's popularity , Venezuela 's strategic importance -- both in location and as a major oil producer -- and fears that taking a tougher line may only hurt U.S. interests .
`` I think the U.S. has tried very hard -- and so far successfully -- not to fall into the trap of becoming perceived to be Chavez 's chief critic and opponent , '' said Bernard Aronson , who headed the State Department 's Inter - American Affairs bureau during the Bush administration .
Venezuela is the fourth largest exporter of oil to the United States at a time when Americans are pressing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production to lower soaring gas prices .
Venezuela 's oil minister heads OPEC , which meets Wednesday .
Last week , Chavez dampened hopes for a price drop , saying world oil prices are `` fair and just '' and that OPEC should try to keep the price around $ 28 a barrel .
Chavez was elected president in December 1998 with the support of poor voters fed up with corruption and the disparate wealth .
The populist and nationalist rejected some U.S. flood relief aid last year because he wanted to limit the number of U.S. soldiers in the country .
At the same time , he has reached out to adversaries of the United States , stressing his close relations with Cuba and playing baseball against a team coached by Castro .
Last month , he cited Gadhafi 's Libya as a model for Venezuelan democracy .
But it 's the lack of cooperation in the fight against illegal drugs that worries some U.S. officials .
They are losing patience because Chavez has not reversed his decision last June to ban U.S. surveillance planes from flying over Venezuela .
Rep. John L. Mica , R - Fla. , said it 's time to consider sanctions .
`` Venezuela has thumbed its nose at the United States , and by allowing drug traffickers to fly in and out of Venezuela air space at will , it has created a new path for a credible volume of narcotics ending up at our shores , '' said Mica , chairman of the House Government Reform Committee 's panel on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources .
The ban on surveillance planes has raised the greatest concerns .
`` It 's a huge problem , '' White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said in an interview with The Associated Press .
With the closing of Howard Air Force base in Panama , much of the U.S. drug surveillance is being handled by planes based in Curacao and Aruba , both just north of Venezuela , and Ecuador .
The planes monitor suspected drug flights between Colombia , the world 's largest producer of cocaine , and Caribbean transfer points .
Since June 1999 , the United States has asked Venezuela 46 times for permission to enter its air space in pursuit of suspected drug flights .
Permission was granted just three times .
McCaffrey said the ban has created a `` black hole '' in regional surveillance , and traffickers are taking advantage .
Venezuela says it has been pursuing drug flights on its own .
`` When we have been notified of the presence of illegal flights in our territory , the response has been very good , '' Venezuelan Vice President Isaias Rodriguez said .
But U.S. officials say that in most cases when the United States has informed Venezuela of a suspicious flight , Venezuela did n't respond or could n't follow the plane .
`` The Venezuelan Air Force operating on its own is manifestly incapable of stopping this traffic , '' McCaffrey said .
Rodriguez said overall drug cooperation has been good .
Seizures have quintupled , he said .
Last year , Chavez agreed to allow the United States to install its third anti-drug radar .
The State Department plays down the overflight ban , noting that it affects a relatively small part of drug shipments , which are more often carried by sea .
This year , the Clinton administration certified Venezuela as `` fully cooperating '' in the drug fight .
Next year , there may be pressure for a tougher line .
Sen. Charles Grassley , chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control , said he may consider the overflight issue as part of the certification process .
`` I know that our administration is trying to work out a deal , but there 's not much to show for it , '' Grassley , R - Iowa , said .
But analysts caution that a harder line could result in less drug cooperation and push Chavez closer to U.S. adversaries .
`` I think the administration just does n't want to do anything that can be seen as adding fuel to the fire , '' said Otto Reich , a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former ambassador to Venezuela .
