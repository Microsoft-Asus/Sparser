AN OVERVIEW OF LAND PLANT EVOLUTION

 

 Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants



 

 Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants



 

 Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae



More than 280,000 species of plants inhabit Earth today. Though some species, such as sea grasses, have returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution, most plants live in terrestrial environments, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests. For now, we will refer to all of these organisms as land plants, even those that are now aquatic, to distinguish them from the algae we discussed as photosynthetic protists in Chapter 28. But land plants did indeed evolve from certain green algae called charophyceans, and we will explore this phylogenetic connection later in the chapter. This section introduces the diversity of modern land plants in the context of their terrestrial adaptations.
