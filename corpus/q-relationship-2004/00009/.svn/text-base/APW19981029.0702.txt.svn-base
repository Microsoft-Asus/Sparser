ANKARA , Turkey
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
With U.S. backing , Turkey and four former Soviet republics signed a declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through Turkey as the main export route from the Caspian 's rich oil fields .
The declaration was a clear message to oil companies , which are expected to announce their preferred route in two weeks and reportedly favor cheaper alternatives to the dlrs 2.5 billion project .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Through the Ankara declaration , Turkey got most of the countries involved in the project to declare their support for the pipeline , which would run from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku through Georgia and to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan .</ENAMEX>
Russia , which has proposed its own route for a pipeline , and Turkmenistan did not back the deal .
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the signing ceremony in a show of Washington 's commitment to the project .
`` Now the issue is not whether Baku - Ceyhan is going to happen , because it is going to happen .
The issue is how , '' Richardson said after the ceremony .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The United States favors the 1,730-kilometer -LRB- 1,075-mile -RRB- Baku - Ceyhan pipeline because it would help bind Azerbaijan , Georgia and Turkey closer to the West , and it would not pass through either Russia or Iran , which also has its own proposed route </ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The presidents of Turkey , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Kazakstan and Uzbekistan signed the declaration during the 75th anniversary celebration of the Turkish republic .</ENAMEX>
Turkmen President Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but gave no reason .
Turkey also signed an agreement with Turkmenistan to build a natural gas pipeline across the Caspian sea to Turkey .
The pipeline would transport 16 billion cubic meters -LRB- 560 billion cubic feet -RRB- of gas per year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed the future of the Caspian oil to flow through Baku - Ceyhan despite `` circles that want to block its realization . ''</ENAMEX>
To counter oil companies ' commercial concerns , the presidents pledged to create `` all necessary conditions for the realization '' of the as-yet-unbuilt pipeline .
This includes serious tax and tariff incentives , Richardson said .
The United States has announced a package of financial support , including a dlrs 823,000 grant for the pipeline , and political risk insurance for companies investing in the project .
The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov. 12 .
The main alternative to Baku - Ceyhan is an existing pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa .
The oil would be transferred in tankers through the Bosporus .
Turkey opposes this route , saying already heavy oil tanker traffic through the narrow strait has led to hundreds of accidents .
