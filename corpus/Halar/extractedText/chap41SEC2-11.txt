 Hormones help regulate digestion

Many animals go for long intervals between meals and do not need to run their digestive systems continuously. Hormones released by the wall of the stomach and duodenum help ensure that digestive secretions are present only when needed. When we see, smell, or taste food, impulses from the brain to the stomach initiate the secretion of gastric juice. Then certain substances in the food stimulate the stomach wall to release the hormone gastrin into the circulatory system. As gastrin gradually recirculates in the bloodstream back to the stomach wall, the hormone stimulates further secretion of gastric juice. Thus, an initial burst of gastric secretion at mealtime is followed by a sustained secretion that continues to add gastric juice to the food for some time. If the pH of the stomach contents becomes too low, the acid will inhibit the release of gastrin, decreasing the secretion of gastric juice; this is an example of negative feedback.

Other hormones, collectively called enterogastrones, are secreted by the wall of the duodenum. The acidic pH of the chyme that enters the duodenum stimulates cells in the wall to release the hormone secretin. This enterogastrone signals the pancreas to release bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acid chyme. A second enterogastrone, cholecystokinin (CCK), is secreted in response to the presence of amino acids or fatty acids. CCK causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the small intestine. CCK also triggers the release of pancreatic enzymes. The chyme, particularly if rich in fats, also causes the duodenum to release other enterogastrones that inhibit peristalsis in the stomach, thereby slowing down the entry of food into the small intestine.
