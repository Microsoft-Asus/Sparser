LONDON , July 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- - The scientist in charge of research into the human form of mad cow disease has suggested baby food and school meals may have been a major source of infection .
The BBC quoted Robert Will , director of the government 's CJD surveillance as saying `` meat processing methods in the 1980s may have led to contaminated beef ending up on children 's plates . ''
His comments came as scientists investigating the deaths from variant CJD of three people who had links with Queniborough , England , are working to pinpoint the source of infected meat the victims may have eaten 20 years ago .
Although the incubation period of the disease is normally 10 years , the youngest two victims first showed symptoms at the age of 14 and many others were also teenagers .
Will said one explanation could be that baby food and school dinners in the 1980s contained mechanically extracted meat - leftovers from the carcass which were removed using high powered water jets and then ground up and used in cheap food products .
