JAKARTA , Indonesia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Defense Secretary William Cohen met with President Abdurrahman Wahid and other Indonesian officials on Monday , an effort to press them to disband militia groups that have killed U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers on Timor island .
After arriving in Jakarta Sunday night , Cohen warned the government to take action against the army-controlled gangs or risk international isolation .
`` The government will have to decide in terms of what the consequences will be , cooperation or isolation , '' said Cohen , who is on a six-nation Asian tour .
President Clinton has publicly urged Wahid to disarm East Timorese militiamen responsible for the Sept. 6 deaths of an American and two other U.N. aid workers .
They also have killed two U.N. peacekeepers in border skirmishes .
Wahid maintains the Timor attacks were orchestrated by hardline commanders loyal to former dictator Suharto in order to discredit and humiliate his reformist government .
The president on Monday fired his national police chief , Gen. Rusdihardjo , after police failed to carry out his order to arrest the youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto to end a spate of unexplained terrorist bombings .
The Indonesian government had guaranteed full security to the U.N. refugee agency in West Timor before the militia attack on its office .
But when a mob stormed the building , police stood by and did nothing .
No arrests have been made for the killings .
But his defense minister , Mahfud M.D. has publicly accused Australia of being behind the attack on the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua , a border town in Indonesian -held West Timor .
Mahfud 's statement that the killings were designed to prevent East Timor 's reintegration into Indonesia has stunned Western analysts and U.N. officials .
`` We are deeply concerned that the government does not seem to understand what happened , '' a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Sunday .
Indonesia occupied East Timor , a former Portuguese colony , in 1975 .
A year ago , the Indonesian army and its paramilitary gangs laid waste to the province after a U.N. referendum ended with an overwhelming vote for independence .
The arrival of international troops put a stop to the rampage and the gangs fled to Indonesian -held West Timor , where they have used border refugee camps as bases for incursions into East Timor .
The United Nations , which is administering East Timor during its transition to independence , has warned that the militias ' aim is to destabilize the province in the hope that the resulting chaos could spark calls for the return of Indonesian rule .
In an apparent show of support for East Timor , four U.S. navy warships this week visited the half-island territory bearing reconstruction materials and other aid .
After last year 's violence , Washington cut off long-standing military-to-military ties with Indonesia .
The Clinton administration also has banned exports of military equipment .
During Suharto 's 32-year regime , the two countries maintained close ties .
Critics of U.S. policy maintain American military training enabled the Indonesians to commit massive human rights abuses in East Timor and elsewhere .
