Russia 's successful launch Wednesday of its service module for the International Space Station is important for more reasons than the accomplishment itself .
It cements the spirit of cooperation among the United States , Russia , and other participating countries that is essential to completing assembly of the station over the next five years .
A good deal of intricate work remains to be done before the module docks with the already-orbiting node assembly on July 25 -- a delicate task depending entirely on automated systems .
Should that fail , the Russians have a three-member crew ready to launch in early August to finish the job .
The technical elements of Russia 's effort are rivaled by the political and economic obstacles that had to be overcome .
Russia 's space program had been severely constrained by loss of the priority treatment it received during the Soviet era , including a sharp loss of funding .
American assistance has been important in overcoming those problems but , even with that , Russia fell two years behind in sending the service module into orbit -- a delay that backed up the entire program and threatened to undermine congressional support for the effort .
Within the Russian space program management group , there was also a lingering affection for the 15-year -old Mir space station .
Its prolonged use -- the last crew left earlier this year -- deflected attention and energy from the International Space Station effort , to the annoyance of NASA officials and other space leaders .
The big step now taken , with the first full-time crew -LRB- two Russians and an American -RRB- slated for the end of the year , increases the likelihood that the space station will become the dominant focus of the Russian program .
Operation of the station will open the way to long-term scientific and technical investigations promising many benefits .
It could also deepen cooperative efforts among formerly competing programs , Russian and American , and thus serve as a model for other fields -- commercial and industrial .
Russia 's step into space , though a bit tardy , deserves to be seen in the United States as important progress toward further gains .
