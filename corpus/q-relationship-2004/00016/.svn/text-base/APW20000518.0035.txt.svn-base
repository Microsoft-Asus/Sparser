UNITED NATIONS
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea late Wednesday following the latest flare-up in their two-year war .
The embargo will be terminated immediately if Secretary - General Kofi Annan reports that `` a peaceful definitive settlement of the conflict '' has been concluded .
Otherwise , the embargo will last for 12 months and the council will then decide whether it should be extended .
`` I think it sends an unequivocal and strong message to the parties to bring an end to this conflict , '' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said after the 15-0 vote on the U.S. -sponsored resolution .
Council members resolved differences over the time limit between the United States and Britain on one side , and Russia and France on the other , after several hours of debate .
The United States , backed by Britain , initially wanted a total arms embargo on both countries , which would only be lifted when a final peace agreement had been signed .
Russia , a major arms supplier to both countries , initially opposed an arms embargo .
The Russians dropped their objection to an arms embargo Tuesday and joined France and other countries in demanding a time limit .
The United States and Britain dropped their demand for an unlimited embargo and proposed that the council review compliance after 12 months -- the time frame that was ultimately accepted .
Russia and France oppose unlimited economic sanctions , especially those imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , which they argue have caused great suffering to ordinary Iraqis .
Fighting between the Horn of Africa neighbors broke out on several fronts last Friday .
Hours later , the Security Council unanimously adopted a British -sponsored resolution calling for `` immediate steps '' to be taken if the two countries did n't stop fighting and resume talks .
The resolution adopted Wednesday night recalls that the council urged all countries last year to end sales of arms and ammunition to Eritrea and Ethiopia .
It bans the sale or supply of weapons , ammunition , military vehicles and equipment , paramilitary equipment and spare parts to both countries .
It also prohibits military-related training or technical assistance .
The conflict over the 620-mile border between Ethiopia and Eritrea -- among the world 's poorest countries -- has cost the lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides .
The resolution deplores the loss of life , strongly condemns the continued fighting , and demands an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of forces .
Both countries have agreed to an Organization of African Unity blueprint for peace .
But Eritrea wants a cease-fire first , which would include a pullback by both sides and a U.N. -supervised demarcation of the border .
Ethiopia wants implementation before a cease-fire , and says Eritrea 's position amounts to `` setting preconditions . ''
The resolution demands the earliest possible reconvening , without preconditions , of `` substantive peace talks '' under OAU auspices .
It also requests the OAU chairman to consider dispatching an envoy to the region to seek an immediate cease-fire and resumption of the peace talks .
This was a key Russian demand .
`` The resolution has strong support for the OAU process and strong endorsement for negotiating a peaceful settlement and final agreement of this bloody conflict , '' Soderberg said .
The fighting forced the World Food Program to temporarily halt food distribution in Ethiopia 's western border area , which could affect tens of thousands of displaced people .
The resolution strongly regrets `` the negative impact the diversion of resources to the conflict continues to have on efforts to address the ongoing humanitarian food crisis in the region . ''
It requests the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments to provide humanitarian assistance and ensure its delivery to needy people .
