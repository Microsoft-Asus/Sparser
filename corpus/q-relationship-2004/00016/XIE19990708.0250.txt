MOSCOW , July 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russia on Thursday rejected as '' untenable and illegitimate '' the U.S. threat to stop assistance to Russia if Moscow sells weapons to Syria .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` We continue to reject as untenable and illegitimate any references to American legislation that make provision for some form of sanctions against Russia for providing armaments to Syria , which is on Washington 's blacklist -LRB- of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism -RRB- , '' the Interfax news agency quoted officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry .</ENAMEX>
`` The Russian side has more than once , including at a high level , brought it to the attention of the American administration that attempts by the United States to give a supranational character to its own laws to the detriment of Russian interests undermine international law and create new irritants in American relations during a period when a normalizing trend has become evident in our dialogue with the United States , '' the unidentified officials said .
Washington 's threat apparently came after Syrian President Hafez Al - Assad 's visit to Russia earlier this week , his first to Moscow since the breakup of the former Soviet Union .
The two sides discussed `` aspects of military-technical cooperation ... in general terms , although they remain an important component of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation , '' the Foreign Ministry officials said .
They stressed that what dominated Russian - Syrian talks during the visit were general international issues , the situation in the Middle East , the Kosovo crisis and the Iraq problem .
Both Russia and Syria have refused to give details of their arms trade , but Russian media said Damascus was seeking to buy as much as 2 billion U.S. dollars in weaponry , including Russia 's new MiG -29 SMT fighter jets and S -300 air defense systems .
Syria is also planning to buy spare parts for its aged fleet of Soviet -made fighters and armored vehicles .
Soviet and made weaponry comprises 90 percent of Syria 's arsenal , The Moscow Times reported Thursday .
