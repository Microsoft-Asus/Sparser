-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami urged the Caspian Sea nations Monday to steer clear of foreign intervention in the development of their resources , the official news agency reported .
The president 's words were apparently aimed at the United States , which has been lobbying hard for the construction of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey .
Iran has proposed an alternative route for transporting Caspian Sea oil that would be cheaper than the Turkish route</ENAMEX> .
But the United States is strongly opposed to the Iranian route for political reasons .
The Islamic Republic News Agency said that during a meeting with the speaker of the Azerbaijani parliament , Murtuz Aleskerov , Khatami said the states of the former Soviet Union had much to lose from foreign intervention .
`` The good of the region should be provided by the regional countries themselves , not by those coming from outside who place their interests above those of the regional states , '' Khatami said .
The Azerbaijani government will play a major role in the decision on the building of the Turkish -bound pipeline , which is expected shortly .
Khatami also called for reaching a consensus among the Caspian Sea states on the framework for the exploitation of the sea 's minerals .
He reiterated that all five countries -- Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Russia and Iran -- should receive a fair share of its resources .
Of the five nations bordering the Caspian , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores .
But Russia and Iran , which have little or no oil near their coasts , want the sea 's resources to be shared by all .
