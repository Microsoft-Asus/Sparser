In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water. Here we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores through the leaf surface (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.2</span>). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water. This response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to CO<SUB>2</SUB>. With stomata even partially closed, CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf, and the concentration of O<SUB>2</SUB> released from photosynthesis begins to increase. These conditions within the leaf favor a seemingly wasteful process called photorespiration.</p><p class="Header3">Photorespiration: An Evolutionary Relic?</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">In most plants, initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco, the Calvin cycle enzyme that adds CO<SUB>2</SUB> to ribulose bisphosphate. Such plants are called <span class="Emphasis2">C<SUB>3</SUB> plants</span> because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.17</span>). Rice, wheat, and soybeans are among the C<SUB>3</SUB> plants that are important in agriculture. These plants produce less food when their stomata close on hot, dry days. The declining level of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the leaf starves the Calvin cycle. Making matters worse, rubisco can accept O<SUB>2</SUB> in place of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. As O<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations overtake CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O<SUB>2</SUB> to the Calvin cycle instead of CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The product splits, and one piece, a two-carbon compound, is exported from the chloroplast. Mitochondria and peroxisomes then break the two-carbon molecule down to CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The process is called <span class="Emphasis2">photorespiration</span> because it occurs in the light (<span class="Emphasis1">photo</span>) and consumes O<SUB>2</SUB> (<span class="Emphasis1">respiration</span>). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, photorespiration generates no ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no food. In fact, photorespiration <span class="Emphasis1">decreases</span> photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">How can we explain the existence of a metabolic process that seems to be counterproductive to the plant? According to one hypothesis, photorespiration is evolutionary baggage--a metabolic relic from a much earlier time, when the atmosphere had less O<SUB>2</SUB> and more CO<SUB>2</SUB> than it does today. In the ancient atmosphere present when rubisco first evolved, the inability of the enzyme’s active site to exclude O<SUB>2</SUB> would have made little difference. The hypothesis speculates that modern rubisco retains some of its ancestral affinity for O<SUB>2</SUB>, which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">It is not known whether photorespiration is beneficial to plants in any way. It <span class="Emphasis1">is</span> known that in many types of plants--including some of agricultural importance, such as soybeans--photorespiration drains away as much as 50%  of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. As heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food, we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful. Indeed, if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity, crop yields and food supplies would increase.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The environmental conditions that foster photorespiration are hot, dry, bright days--the conditions that cause stomata to close. In certain plant species, alternate modes of carbon fixation that minimize photorespiration--even in hot, arid climates--have evolved. The two most important of these photosynthetic adaptations are C<SUB>4</SUB> photosynthesis and CAM.</p><p class="Header3">C<SUB>4</SUB> Plants</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">C<SUB>4</SUB> plants</span> are so named because they preface the Calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a four-carbon compound as its first product. Several thousand species in at least 19 plant families use the C<SUB>4</SUB> pathway. Among the C<SUB>4</SUB> plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn, members of the grass family.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C<SUB>4</SUB> photosynthesis (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.18</span>; compare with<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.2</span>). In C<SUB>4</SUB> plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. <span class="Emphasis2">Bundle-sheath cells</span> are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged <span class="Emphasis2">mesophyll cells.</span> The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath. However, the cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO<SUB>2</SUB> into organic compounds in the mesophyll. The first step is the addition of CO<SUB>2</SUB> to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. The enzyme <span class="Emphasis2">PEP carboxylase</span> adds CO<SUB>2</SUB> to PEP. Compared to rubisco, PEP carboxylase has a very high affinity for CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix CO<SUB>2</SUB> efficiently when rubisco cannot--that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration in the leaf to fall and O<SUB>2</SUB> concentration to rise. After the C<SUB>4</SUB> plant fixes CO<SUB>2</SUB>, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.18</span>) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.28</span>). Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO<SUB>2</SUB>, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig10-18','../fig/big/fig10-18.jpg','fig10-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig10-18.jpg" alt="fig10-18" name="myfig10-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 10-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">C<SUB>4</SUB> leaf anatomy and the C<SUB>4</SUB> pathway.</span> The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C<SUB>4</SUB> plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates.

In this way, C<SUB>4</SUB> photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, and it is in such environments that C<SUB>4</SUB> plants evolved and thrive today.</p><p class="Header3">CAM Plants</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in succulent (water-storing) plants (including ice plants), many cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO<SUB>2</SUB> from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO<SUB>2</SUB> and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called <span class="Emphasis2">crassulacean acid metabolism,</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">CAM,</span> after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of <span class="Emphasis2">CAM plants</span> store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO<SUB>2</SUB> is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">Notice in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 10.19</span> that the CAM pathway is similar to the C<SUB>4</SUB> pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C<SUB>4</SUB> plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times. (Keep in mind that CAM, C<SUB>4</SUB>, and C<SUB>3</SUB> plants all eventually use the Calvin cycle to make sugar from carbon dioxide.)</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig10-19','../fig/big/fig10-19.jpg','fig10-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig10-19.jpg" alt="fig10-19" name="myfig10-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 10-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">C<SUB>4</SUB> and CAM photosynthesis compared.</span> Both adaptations are characterized by
