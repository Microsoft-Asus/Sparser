-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Russia 's Mir space station will stay up until next year and possibly longer if the program manages to land private funding , a top space official said Tuesday .</ENAMEX>
`` We 've got more than 10 tons of scientific hardware on board the Mir station , '' said Boris Ostroumov , deputy director general of the Russian Space Agency .
`` I thought Americans are very practical people .
It simply does not make too much sense to get rid of such a treasure . ''
Despite Russia 's keen desire to keep Mir flying as long as possible , Ostroumov said the 13-year -old outpost will not siphon money or cargo ships away from the new international space station .
The international space station is Russia 's top priority no matter how long Mir remains in orbit , he stressed .
In town for Discovery 's launch to the international space station on Thursday with 4,300 pounds of supplies , Ostroumov said his agency has enough money to keep Mir flying through August .
But Mir 's present orbit of more than 200 miles is such that it would be safe through February , even if it 's unstaffed , he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Until now , Russian space officials had assured NASA that Mir would come down in August unless private investors could be found .</ENAMEX>
Ostroumov declined to give any details on how the search was going .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But he did acknowledge there was no way any Mir artifacts could be returned to Earth for auction .</ENAMEX>
`` Believe me , we 've thought almost of any possible outcome or any possible way out of this situation , '' he said .
Just about everyone agrees Russia cannot afford more than one space station given the country 's economic crisis .
A crucial control module is 1 1/2 years behind schedule , for instance , and has stalled the entire assembly of the international space station as Russian engineers try to complete and test it with what little money they have .
That 's why NASA is so anxious for Mir to come down -- so the Russians can devote all their time , energy and resources to the new , 16-nation space station .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">If the Russian space program cannot find private investors to keep Mir going , the current three-man crew likely will be the last , Ostroumov said .</ENAMEX>
The station would be dragged down through the atmosphere by an attached cargo ship sometime after February and burn up , he said .
The details of Mir 's fiery plunge -- as well as the decision to do so -- would be worked out by space station designers .
`` We all understand that we cannot support two programs at the same time , '' Ostroumov said .
`` No matter how badly we feel about that , we would have to say goodbye to the Mir station .
The question is : When and how ? ''
