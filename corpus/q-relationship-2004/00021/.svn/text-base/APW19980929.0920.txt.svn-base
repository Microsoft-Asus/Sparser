President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda flew to Libya on Tuesday , apparently violating U.N. sanctions that ban air travel to the North African country , Egypt 's Middle East News Agency reported .
Museveni told reporters on arrival in the Libyan capital Tripoli that he will discuss with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi the situation in Africa and several other issues of common interest , the agency said .
At least six other African leaders have violated the sanctions with flights to Tripoli .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Organization of African Unity earlier this year said it no longer would abide by the sanctions when travel to Libya was required for humanitarian activities or official business</ENAMEX> .
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
