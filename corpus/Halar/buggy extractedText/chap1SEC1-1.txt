EXPLORING LIFE ON ITS MANY LEVELS

 

 Each level of biological organization has emergent properties



 

 Cells are an organism's basic units of structure and function



 

 The continuity of life is based on heritable information in the form of DNA



 

 Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization



 

 Organisms are open systems that interact continuously with their environments



 

 Regulatory mechanisms ensure a dynamic balance in living systems



Biologists study life on many different levels, from the molecular to the global (FIGURE 1.1). This first set of themes will help you integrate the many biological levels into a cohesive view of life.
