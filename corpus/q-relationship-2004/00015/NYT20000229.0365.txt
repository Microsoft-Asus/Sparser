UNITED NATIONS --
The U.N. Drug Control Program says in a report made public Tuesday that Afghanistan now not only is the largest producer of opium but also is becoming a major manufacturer of heroin , which is contributing to a rise in addiction throughout the region .
The report , prepared for a meeting here of Afghanistan 's six neighbors on Monday , plus the United States and Russia , says that Pakistan and Iran now have some of the world 's highest rates of addiction to heroin , which is derived from opium .
`` Central Asian countries show alarming signs of fast-increasing abuse rates , '' it says .
Afghanistan is encircled by Pakistan , Iran , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and a far-western corridor of China .
`` The number of heroin addicts in the region exceeds that of Western Europe and is still on the increase , '' says the report , prepared by Pino Arlacchi , executive director of the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .
The report adds that communities of addicts in the region are seen as easy targets for organized crime and vectors for the spread of AIDS .
The report says that there is no evidence to support charges that drug profits are going either to leaders of the Taliban , who control most of Afghanistan , or to the Northern Alliance , the remains of the former government .
Both forces impose taxes on traders , however , with the Taliban earning $ 10 million to $ 30 million a year , according to varying estimates , the report says .
It says no estimates are available of the alliance 's earnings from this source .
As a country , the report says , Afghanistan receives only about 1 percent of the global profits of the opium and heroin originating there .
Poor farmers with no other easy way to earn an income do most of the cultivation , turning over crops to local traders .
The U.N. report links the increase in narcotics production in Afghanistan with the economic , political and social collapse caused by decades of civil war .
`` Like viruses thrive best in frail bodies , '' it says , `` illicit drugs prosper best in regions that are in internal turmoil with weak or nonexistent government structures and controls . ''
Taliban leaders say that until they get help in building an economy , they cannot ask farmers to forgo the only income they have .
