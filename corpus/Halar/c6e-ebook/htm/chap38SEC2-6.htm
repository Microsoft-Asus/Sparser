As the embryo develops from the zygote, the seed stockpiles proteins, oils, and starch. This is why seeds are such major nutrient sinks (see Chapter 36). Initially, these nutrients are stored in the endosperm, but later in seed development in many species, the storage function of the endosperm is more or less taken over by the swelling storage leaves (cotyledons) of the embryo itself.</p><p class="Header3">Endosperm Development</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Endosperm development usually precedes embryo development. After double fertilization, the triploid nucleus of the ovule’s central cell divides, forming a multinucleate "supercell" having a milky consistency. This liquid mass, the endosperm, becomes multicellular when cytokinesis partitions the cytoplasm by forming membranes between the nuclei. Eventually, these "naked" cells produce cell walls, and the endosperm becomes solid. Coconut "milk" is an example of liquid endosperm; coconut "meat" is an example of solid endosperm.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The endosperm is rich in nutrients, which it provides to the developing embryo. In most monocots and some dicots, the endosperm also stores nutrients that can be used by the seedling after germination. In many dicots (including bean seeds), the food reserves of the endosperm are completely exported to the cotyledons (seed leaves) before the seed completes its development, and consequently the mature seed lacks endosperm.</p><p class="Header3">Embryo Development</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The first mitotic division of the zygote is transverse, splitting the fertilized egg into a basal cell and a terminal cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.10</span>). The terminal cell eventually gives rise to most of the embryo. The basal cell continues to divide transversely, producing a thread of cells called the suspensor, which anchors the embryo to its parent. The suspensor functions in the transfer of nutrients to the embryo from the parent plant and, in some plants, from the endosperm. Meanwhile, the terminal cell divides several times and forms a spherical proembryo attached to the suspensor. The cotyledons (seed leaves) begin to form as bumps on the proembryo. A dicot, with its two cotyledons, is heart-shaped at this stage. Only one cotyledon develops in monocots.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig38-10','../fig/big/fig38-10.jpg','fig38-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig38-10.jpg" alt="fig38-10" name="myfig38-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 38-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The development of a dicot plant embryo.</span> By the time the ovule becomes a mature seed and the integuments harden and thicken to form the seed coat, the zygote has given rise to an embryonic plant with rudimentary organs.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Soon after the rudimentary cotyledons appear, the embryo elongates. Cradled between the cotyledons is the apical meristem of the embryonic shoot. At the opposite end of the embryo’s axis, where the suspensor attaches, is the apex of the embryonic root, also with a meristem. After the seed germinates, the apical meristems at the tips of shoot and root will sustain primary growth as long as the plant lives (see Chapter 35). The three primary meristems--protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium--are also present in the embryo. Thus, development of the embryo establishes two features of plant form: the root-shoot axis, with meristems at opposite ends; and a radial pattern of protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium, set to give rise to the three tissue systems (dermal, ground, and vascular tissues).</p><p class="Header3">Structure of the Mature Seed</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">During the last stages of its maturation, the seed dehydrates until its water content is only about 5-15%  of its weight. The embryo, surrounded by its enlarged cotyledons or endosperm, or both, stops growing until the seed germinates.

At this stage, the embryo consists of an elongate structure, the embryonic axis, attached to fleshy cotyledons (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.11a</span>, p. 792). Below the point at which the cotyledons are attached, the embryonic axis is called the <span class="Emphasis2">hypocotyl</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">hypo</span>, "under"). The hypocotyl terminates in the <span class="Emphasis2">radicle,</span> or embryonic root. The portion of the embryonic axis above the cotyledons is the <span class="Emphasis2">epicotyl</span> (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">epi</span>, "on" or "over").
