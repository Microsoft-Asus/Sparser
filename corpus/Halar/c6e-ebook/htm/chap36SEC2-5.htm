The cell wall itself, however, does not play a direct role in regulating the traffic of molecules into and out of the protoplast; that is the role of the selectively permeable plasma membrane. The plasma membrane serves as a barrier between two major compartments: the cell wall and the cytosol (the part of the cytoplasm contained within the plasma membrane but outside the intracellular organelles). Most mature plant cells have a third major compartment, the vacuole, a large organelle that can occupy as much as 90%  of the protoplast’s volume (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 36.6a</span>). The membrane that bounds the vacuole, the <span class="Emphasis2">tonoplast,</span> regulates molecular traffic between the cytosol and the vacuolar contents, called cell sap. For example, the tonoplast has proton pumps that expel H<SUP>+</SUP> from the cytosol into the vacuole. This augments the ability of the proton pumps of the plasma membrane to maintain a low cytosolic concentration of H<SUP>+</SUP>.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig36-6','../fig/big/fig36-6.jpg','fig36-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig36-6.jpg" alt="fig36-6" name="myfig36-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 36-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Compartments of plant cells and tissues and routes for lateral transport.
