Council members took a more distanced reaction to the strikes , with France 's U.N. ambassador Alain Dejammet , saying his government took note of the right of countries to protect themselves `` which is acknowledged by international law . ''
China 's deputy ambassador , Shen Guofang , said his country `` condemns all forms of terrorist acts , '' and said his country was waiting for further information and details before commenting on whether the United States was acting in self-defense .
U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings linked to bin Laden at U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , which killed over 250 people .
`` The targets struck , and the timing and method of attack used , were carefully designed to minimize risks of collateral damage to civilians and to comply with international law , including the rules of necessity and proportionality , '' Richardson wrote in his letter .
In April , Richardson travelled to Afghanistan , where the Saudi -born Bin Laden lives , and received a promise from Taliban leaders to keep him `` under wraps '' and prevent him from using Afghanistan as a base for terrorist activities .
`` It is the sincere hope of the United States government that these limited actions will deter and prevent the repetition of unlawful terrorist attacks on the United States and other countries , '' Richardson in the letter to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia .
`` We call on all nations to take the steps necessary to bring such indiscriminate terrorism to an end . ''
