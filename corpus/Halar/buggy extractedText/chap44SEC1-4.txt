EXCRETORY SYSTEMS

 

 Most excretory systems produce urine by refining a filtrate derived from body fluids: an overview



 

 Diverse excretory systems are variations on a tubular theme



 

 Nephrons and associated blood vessels are the functional units of the mammalian kidney



 

 The mammalian kidney's ability to conserve water is a key terrestrial adaptation



 

 Diverse adaptations of the vertebrate kidney have evolved in different habitats



 

 Interacting regulatory systems maintain homeostasis



Although the problems of water balance on land or in salt water or fresh water are very different, their solutions all depend on the regulation of solute movement between internal fluids and the external environment. Much of this is handled by excretory systems, which are central to homeostasis because they dispose of metabolic wastes and control body fluid composition by adjusting the rates of loss of particular solutes.
