The mapping and sequencing of the human genome, one of the great achievements of modern science, has been made possible by advances in DNA technology, starting with the invention of methods for making <span class="Emphasis2">recombinant DNA</span>. This is DNA in which genes from two different sources--often different species--are combined</span> in vitro <span class="Emphasis1">into the same molecule.</span></p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The methods for making recombinant DNA are also central to <span class="Emphasis2">genetic engineering,</span> the direct manipulation of genes for practical purposes. Applications include the manufacture of hundreds of products. Using DNA technology, scientists can make recombinant DNA and then introduce it into cultured cells that replicate the DNA and may express its genes, yielding a desired protein. The bacterium</span> E. coli <span class="Emphasis1">is often used as a "host" organism for recombinant DNA because it is easy to grow and its biochemistry is well understood.</span></p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">DNA technology has launched a revolution in biotechnology. In broad terms, <span class="Emphasis2">biotechnology</span> is the manipulation of organisms or their components to make useful products. Practices that go back centuries, such as the use of microbes to make wine and cheese and the selective breeding of livestock, are examples of biotechnology. Natural genetic processes, such as mutation and genetic recombination, have always been involved. But biotechnology based on the manipulation of DNA</span> in vitro <span class="Emphasis1">differs from earlier practices by enabling scientists to modify specific genes and move them between organisms as distinct as bacteria, plants, and animals.</span></p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">DNA technology is now applied in areas ranging from agriculture to criminal law, but its most important achievements have been in basic research. DNA technology has stimulated discoveries in virtually all fields of biology by giving researchers new tools for tackling age-old questions. And it is providing us with detailed knowledge of the genomes of humans and many other organisms, knowledge largely inaccessible only a few decades ago.</span></p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In this chapter, we describe the main techniques of DNA manipulation, discuss how genomes are analyzed at the DNA level, and survey the practical applications of DNA technology. In a concluding section, we consider some of the social and ethical issues that arise as DNA technology becomes more pervasive in our lives.</span></p></td></tr></table></body></html>
