MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Russian and Japanese leaders issued a `` Moscow Declaration '' on Friday in which they pledged to seek an end to their 53-year -old dispute over the Kuril islands by the end of next year .
If they succeed , it would mean that Russia and Japan could formally end World War II before the end of the 20th century .
The dispute over ownership of the tiny islands has stopped the two countries from ever signing a formal peace treaty .
The declaration , signed Thursday by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia , gives no hint of how the conflict might be resolved , but sets up a new mechanism -- and a new resolve -- for doing it .
`` All of us gained something , '' said Yeltsin 's spokesman , Dmitry Yakushkin .
The declaration was issued at the outset of talks between Obuchi and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia .
The two had been expected to focus on the details of when and how Japan will hand over an dlrs 800 million installment on a loan it promised last summer .
There was no immediate indication that the loan details had been resolved in their talks .
On Thursday , Obuchi and Yeltsin `` exchanged views from broad and lofty perspectives , '' as Obuchi 's spokesman put it , in the first formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to the Russian capital in 25 years .
While the subject of the disputed islands loomed over the talks , the leaders were also expected to work out the timing and logistics of Japan 's loan , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer .
Both the IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its economic crisis in August .
In addition to agreeing to free up the loan , Obuchi has offered to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on the Kuril islands , dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to support youth exchange programs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The two prime ministers signed a spate of agreements , including one on guarantees of capital investments that is expected to pave the way for large-scale Japanese investment in Russia , ITAR - Tass said .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The two also agreed on the concept of a Russian - Japanese investment company that would promote direct investments in Russia by Japanese companies .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">They signed memorandums on cooperation in tourism , transport , mail and telecommunications , as well as support for Russia 's and medium-size companies .</ENAMEX>
Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by the Kuril dispute .
Tokyo claimed title to the islands -- Etorofu , Kunashiri , Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- in a treaty with Russia in 1875 .
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War II , a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal .
The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian residents , many of whom would welcome Japanese administration .
The Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters .
