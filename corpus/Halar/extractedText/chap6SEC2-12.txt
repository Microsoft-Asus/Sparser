 The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review

Recall that life is organized along a hierarchy of structural levels. With each increase in the level of order, new properties emerge in addition to those of the component parts. In Chapters 2-6, we have dissected the chemistry of life using the strategy of the reductionist. But we have also begun to develop a more integrated view of life as we have seen how properties emerge with increasing order.

We have seen that the unusual behavior of water, so essential to life on Earth, results from interactions of the water molecules, themselves an ordered arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. We reduced the great complexity and diversity of organic compounds to the chemical characteristics of carbon, but we also saw that the unique properties of organic compounds are related to the specific structural arrangements of carbon skeletons and their appended functional groups. We learned that small organic molecules are often assembled into giant molecules, but we also discovered that a macromolecule does not behave like a simple composite of its monomers. For example, the unique form and function of a protein are consequences of a hierarchy of primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. And in this chapter we have learned that metabolism, that orderly chemistry that characterizes life, is a concerted interplay of thousands of different kinds of molecules in an organized cell.

By completing our overview of metabolism with an introduction to its structural basis in the compartmentalized cell, we have built a bridge to Unit Two, where we will study the cell's structure and function in more depth. We will maintain our balance between the need to reduce life to a conglomerate of simpler processes and the ultimate satisfaction of viewing those processes in their integrated context.
