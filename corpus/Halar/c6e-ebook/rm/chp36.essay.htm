									<a name="para95"></a><p class="BlockText">Water use is a serious social and environmental issue in the arid southwestern United States. In recent years, there has been growing criticism of water-intensive ornamental landscapes like lawns and golf greens.

Is this form of water use something society should limit or even eliminate in such areas? Or, should property owners be free to landscape as they choose? Defend your side in this debate.</p>
