CAIRO , September 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Arab countries are considering to bypass the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya if its demand for a fair trial for the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is not met .
Libya has rejected a new U.S. - British decision to accept the trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should they be convicted .
The U.S. and Britain , who had been demanding extradition of the two Libyan suspects to either of them , insisted that their offer is non-negotiable .
The two were accused of blowing up an American plane in 1988 over Lockerbie , Scotland , which killed 270 people .
The U.N. imposed air , arms and diplomatic embargo on the country in 1992 after it failed to hand over the two suspects .
The Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Arab League -LRB- AL -RRB- headquarters Wednesday are discussing a draft resolution on supporting Libya 's demand for necessary guarantees for the two Libyans before the trial , according to the Middle East News Agency .
The draft proposes stopping compliance with the sanctions unless the `` parties concerned '' agree to negotiate with Libya on these guarantees .
It also asserts the commitment of Arab states to ending the enforcement of the embargo on Libya as soon as agreement is reached on the guarantees and arrangements involved between the sides .
The draft resolution supports Libya 's right to claim damages for human and material losses , sustained as a result of the seven-year U.N. sanctions .
This development is widely viewed by observers as an attempt by the 22-member Arab forum to court back Libya .
Tripoli on Sunday decided to disband its Ministry of Arab Unity in the coming few weeks , a move revealing its grudge against Arab failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the Afro - Arab country lifted .
The AL last week reaffirmed its support for Libya 's request for `` guarantees '' on the fate of the two Libyan suspects before Tripoli delivers them for trial .
AL chief Esmat Abdel Meguid Sunday proposed that Libya and the Netherlands sign a pre-trial agreement spelling out details surrounding the prosecution of the Libyan suspects .
In a recent TV interview , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has rapped Arab countries for not showing enough support to Libya , while praising the Organization of African Unity for backing its demand for lifting the sanctions</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and Britain fail to make compromise</ENAMEX> .
