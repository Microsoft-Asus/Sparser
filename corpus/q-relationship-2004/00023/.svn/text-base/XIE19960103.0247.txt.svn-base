LAGOS , January 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- says that there are about 6,000 child soldiers fighting for the various armed factions in the Liberian civil war .
ICRC alleged in the current edition of its magazine `` Red Cross Crescent '' that the children being used in the war were being put under the influence of drugs by their commanders .
The children , described as mostly `` young uneducated combatants '' , gave themselves scary combat names such as `` general snake '' , `` captain double trouble '' , and `` major rambo '' among others .
ICRC delegate in Monrovia , Liberian capital , Urs Lusser , warned in the magazine that the rehabilitation and `` re-education '' of the children soldiers would be a major challenge in the post war liberia .
The organisation , however , expressed optimism that the peace agreement signed in August 1995 in Nigerian capital Abuja would bring the Liberian conflict to an end .
