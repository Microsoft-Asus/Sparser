-LRB- AP -RRB- --
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook dangled a carrot in front of India Thursday to try to prevent an escalation of its nuclear arms race with Pakistan .
Speaking after an emergency meeting of the five official nuclear powers to discuss a response to the crisis , Cook said India could be offered help to improve the `` deteriorating '' nuclear reactors used to supply the country 's tottering electricity supply system .
But it would have to give assurances that the help would n't be diverted to boost India 's nuclear weapons program , Cook said .
He stressed there was `` no question of rewarding those countries for carrying out nuclear tests . ''
The poor state of India 's electricity system has caused riots in recent weeks .
Citizens in the capital New Delhi , frustrated over frequent power outages , have taken to the streets and attacked offices of government-run electricity offices .
In response to questions from reporters about the lack of reference in a joint statement agreed at the meeting to sanctions or other measures encouraging India and Pakistan to refrain from nuclear proliferation , Cook said he raised the issue of help for the country 's electricity system .
`` There is a very real problem there for India , and it is a problem we could be willing to assist , '' said Cook .
`` But we do need to be confident there are safeguards on those civil nuclear reactors which could make sure that in helping those -LRB- reactors -RRB- , we were not unintentionally helping the nuclear weapons program . ''
Cook told a news conference after the meeting of the U.N. Security Council 's five permanent members that ministers approved `` without change or controversy '' a text in which they agreed to seek assurances from India and Pakistan that they would n't carry out further tests .
Cook said sanctions were n't addressed by the meeting , which he called `` very successful . ''
