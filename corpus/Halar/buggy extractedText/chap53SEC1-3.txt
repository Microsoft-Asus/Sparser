DISTURBANCE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

 

 Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances



 

 Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance



 

 Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance



Decades ago, most ecologists favored the traditional view that biological communities are in a state of equilibrium, a more or less stable balance, unless seriously disturbed by human activities. This "balance of nature" view focused on interspecific competition as a key factor determining community composition and maintaining stability in communities. Stability in this context is the tendency of a community to reach and maintain an equilibrium, or relatively constant composition of species, in the face of disturbances. But in many communities, at least on a local scale, change seems to be more common than stability. This recent emphasis on change has led to a nonequilibrium model of communities, where communities are seen as constantly changing after being buffeted by disturbances. The key question here is the role of disturbances in affecting community structure and composition.
