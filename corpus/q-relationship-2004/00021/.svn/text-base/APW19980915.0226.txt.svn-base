CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Libya has urged Arab countries to ignore the U.N. sanctions imposed on it six years ago because it has accepted U.N. demands to hand over for trial two suspects in a passenger jet bombing , Egypt 's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday .
The Libyan plea came in a memorandum sent to the Arab League asking the issue be discussed by a meeting of Arab foreign ministers scheduled Wednesday and Thursday at the headquarters of the 22-nation league in Cairo , MENA said .
In the memorandum , Libya reaffirmed its acceptance of a proposal for a trial of the two Libyans in the Netherlands by Scottish judges , the agency said .
It added Libya also repeated its call for certain guarantees for the suspects .
The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie , Scotland , killed 270 people .
Libya 's statement said that regional organizations , especially the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League , should have a major role as guarantors and witnesses in the trial of the two suspects , MENA added .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Organization of African Unity decided at its June summit to no longer abide by the sanctions when travel was required for humanitarian activities or official business</ENAMEX> .
Several African leaders have violated the sanctions since then .
The sanctions , which ban air travel to and from the country , were imposed in 1992 to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the two Libyans .
Libya claimed the two men could not get a fair trial in England or the United States .
In an effort to resolve the impasse , Washington and London last month offered to accept a trial before a Scottish tribunal in the Netherlands .
Gadhafi agreed to that in principle but has called for negotiations with the two countries on the details of the trial and the suspects ' care once they have been transferred to Dutch custody .
