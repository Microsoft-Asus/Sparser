									<a name="para76"></a><p class="BlockText">Draw a cladogram that includes a moss, a fern, and a gymnosperm. Use a charophycean alga as the out-group. (See Chapter 25 if you need to review cladistics.) Label each branch of the cladogram with at least one derived characteristic unique to that clade.</p>

									<a name="para78"></a><p class="BlockText">In April 1986, an accident at a nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, scattered radioactive fallout for hundreds of miles. In assessing the biological effects of the radiation, researchers found mosses to be especially valuable as organisms for monitoring the damage. Radiation damages organisms by causing mutations. Explain why it is faster to observe the genetic effects of radiation on bryophytes than on plants from other groups. Imagine that you are conducting tests shortly after a nuclear accident. Using potted moss plants as your experimental organisms, design an experiment to test the hypothesis that the frequency of mutations decreases with the organism’s distance from the source of radiation.</p>

									<a name="para80"></a><p class="BlockText">Nonvascular plants and seedless vascular plants are extremely common, and several of them have important economic and ecological uses. And yet, essentially no member of these ancient plant groups is of agricultural importance. Why? Can you think of attributes that these groups lack that may be precisely why so many seed plants are of agricultural significance to society? And attributes they possess that limit their agricultural utility?</p>
