New laboratory and field methods coupled with clever choices of experimental organisms have catalyzed a research explosion. For example, many scientists interested in the genetic control of plant development, including Joanne Chory, whom you met in the interview on pages 718-719, are focusing their research on <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>, a little weed of the mustard family (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 35.25</span>). <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> is small enough to allow researchers to cultivate thousands of the plants in a few square meters of lab space. <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> also has a short generation span of about six weeks, making it an excellent model for genetic studies. Plant biologists are also attracted to <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> by its tiny genome; the amount of DNA per cell ranks among the least of all known plants. Because of these attributes, <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> was the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, a multinational effort that took six years to complete.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig35-25','../fig/big/fig35-25.jpg','fig35-25');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig35-25.jpg" alt="fig35-25" name="myfig35-25"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 35-25.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis thaliana</span>.</span> Owing to its small size, rapid life cycle, and small genome, <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> (inset) was the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced (some 26,000 genes).

This level of complexity is similar to that found in the fly <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila</span>. Knowing what some of the <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> genes do has already expanded our understanding of plant development. However, the functions of about 45%  of <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis’</span>;s genes are unknown (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 35.25</span>).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Now that the DNA sequence of the <span class="Emphasis1">Arabidopsis</span> genome is completely known, plant biologists have launched an ambitious quest to determine the function of every one of the plant’s genes by the year 2010. By identifying each gene’s function and tracking every chemical pathway, researchers aim to establish a blueprint for how plants are built. One of the key tasks will be to identify exactly which cells are manufacturing which gene products and at what stages in the plant’s life. Researchers also plan to create mutants for every gene in the genome. As Joanne Chory predicted, it may one day be possible to create a computer-generated "virtual plant" that will enable researchers to visualize which plant genes are activated in different parts of the plant during the entire course of development.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
