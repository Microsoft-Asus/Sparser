-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Negotiations between China and the United States on China 's bid to join the World Trade Organization have resumed , and the two sides will hold high-level talks on the matter in the coming days , a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Wednesday .
U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy met with China 's top WTO negotiator in Beijing this week , embassy spokesman Bill Palmer said .
Prior to Cassidy 's visit , talks on China 's 13-year campaign to join the world trade rules-making body were frozen because of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia .
Next , U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will hold bilateral discussions with Chinese trade officials in Auckland , New Zealand , the site of a Pacific Rim economic summit , Palmer said .
Officials on both sides are hoping to make progress before a meeting Saturday between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin .
The WTO sets rules for international trade and encourages the liberalization of trade .
The U.S. has in the past been reluctant to admit China , which would have to initiate reforms and reduce tariffs to be part of the WTO .
Britain 's trade and industry minister said Wednesday that China should be admitted before the end of the year .
China is `` a major economic actor on the global stage and therefore they ought to part of the WTO and we think that would be good for the U.K , '' Richard Caborn said .
Britain is `` very pleased that the U.S. has now got back into dialogue about the entry of China into the WTO and we hope that 's going to be successful , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In a strange diplomatic twist , longtime Chinese antagonist Taiwan is also lobbying for China 's entry .
China , which claims sovereignty over Taiwan , demands that the island not be permitted into the WTO first .</ENAMEX>
That has put Taiwanese officials in the unusual position of lobbying on behalf of China as a means of furthering their own bid .
Taipei 's American Chamber of Commerce will push hard for both countries ' entry during a trip to Washington next week , Chamber President Paul Cassingham said .
Cassingham said the topic will top the agenda in meetings between a chamber delegation and U.S. officials during the chamber 's annual lobbying trip .
