Despite their diversity, all photoreceptors contain similar pigment molecules that absorb light, and most, if not all, photoreceptors in the animal kingdom may be homologous. Animals as diverse as flatworms, annelids, arthropods, and vertebrates have some of the same, ancient genes associated with the development of photoreceptors in embryos. Thus, the genetic underpinnings of all photoreceptors may have evolved in the earliest bilateral animals (see Chapter 33). The actual eyes that form in an animal depend on developmental patterns regulated by genetic mechanisms that evolved later in the animal’s taxonomic group, and whose effects appear to be superimposed on the ancient, homologous mechanism.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
