THE CYTOSKELETON

 

 Providing structural support to the cell, the cytoskeleton also functions in cell motility and regulation



In the early days of electron microscopy, biologists thought that the organelles of a eukaryotic cell floated freely in the cytosol. But improvements in both light microscopy and electron microscopy have revealed the cytoskeleton, a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm (FIGURE 7.20). The cytoskeleton plays a major role in organizing the structures and activities of the cell.
