ANKARA , May 14 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The fourth round of northern Iraq peace talks started here today to discuss measures for bringing peace and stability to the region , the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported .
Representatives of three rival parties , namely the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , the Kurdistan Democratic Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- as well as the Turkmen Front , and officials from the United States , Britain and Turkey attended the meeting .
Speaking to the press before the talks , Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen , head of the Turkish delegation , said that the ceasefire provided in the region was a success of the Ankara process .
The mechanism created to monitor the ceasefire was also working well thanks to the efforts of all parties concerned , he said .
Diplomatic sources close to the talks were quoted as saying that the fourth round of peace talks was a continuation of the Ankara process , jointly sponsored by the U.S. , Britain and Turkey , but no concrete result could be expected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The meeting came as the Turkish security troops launched a massive cross-border military operation in pursuit of the outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- early this morning</ENAMEX> .
Under the agreement reached by the KDP and PUK in the third round of peace talks last February , the Peace Monitoring Force -LRB- PMF -RRB- began its mission in northern Iraq late last month to supervise the truce between the two rival Kurdish parties in the region .
A glimmer of hope was once expected when the PUK and KDP signed a peace accord on October 31 , 1996 under the mediation of the U.S. , Britain and Turkey .
However , The KDP 's pullout from the peace talks cast a shadow on the Ankara process after a high-ranking KDP official was assassinated in northern Iraq in mid- March by alleged PUK militants .
Turkey , supporting Iraq 's Turkmen minority because of ethnic and cultural bonds , wants the Turkmen to have a say in the administration of the region .
The KDP , backed by the Iraqi government troops , fought against the pro- Iran PUK and got the upper hand in late August last year , leading to a U.S. air strike against the Iraqi military targets .
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by the two Kurdish groups since the Gulf War in 1991 , but it split into rival zones after the KDP and PUK began fighting each in 1994 .
