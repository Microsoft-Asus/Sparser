`` Congress must pass common-sense gun legislation to protect our children without constraining the rights of legitimate gun owners , '' Clinton said in his weekly radio address .
He said every day in the United States nearly a dozen children are killed by guns , either intentionally or accidentally , leaving families with `` a wound that never heals . ''
Thousands of parents and children in the United States will rally for the licensing of gun owners and registration of firearms in a Mother 's Day in Washington Sunday .
The `` Million Mom March '' will take over the National Mall , while supporters plan to gather in nearly other communities in support of greater gun control .
Scheduled participants include entertainers , politicians and parents who personally experienced gun violence .
Sponsors want to convince Congress that ordinary Americans and parents who personally experienced gun violence .
Meanwhile , also Sunday , members of a pro-gun organization , Second Amendment Sisters , plan speeches on the Washington Monument grounds and a march to the Capitol .
The event is independent of the National Rifle Association -LRB- NRA -RRB- .
Gun control legislation is stalled in the U.S. Congress and prospects for action appear dim in an election year .
The U.S. Senate approved several measures a year ago , including a requirement that weapons have child safety locks .
It also would require a three-day waiting period before a sale by an unlicensed gun seller at a gun show .
The same time frame is currently required for licensed dealer sales at shows and in stores .
The Senate also approved language that would ban the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips ; ban possession of firearms by those convicted of committing violent crimes as juveniles , and prohibit juveniles from acquiring assault weapons .
However , the House rejected any new controls and there are no scheduled meetings between House and Senate conferees .
The Clinton administration strongly supports the safety locks and waiting period language and has criticized the failure of conferees to meet to fashion a compromise .
The NRA and its supporters argue there are plenty of gun regulations now but the administration has not been enforcing them .
The `` Million Mom March '' organizers want further restrictions beyond the Senate -approved measures .
Chief among them is the registration of all handguns and a license for their owners .
