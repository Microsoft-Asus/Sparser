PLANT RESPONSES TO HORMONES

 

 Research on how plants grow toward light led to the discovery of plant hormones



 

 Plant hormones help coordinate growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli



The word hormone is derived from a Greek verb meaning "to excite." Found in all multicellular organisms, hormones are chemical signals that coordinate the parts of the organism. By definition, a hormone is a compound that is produced by one part of the body and then transported to other parts of the body, where it binds to a specific receptor and triggers responses in target cells and tissues. Another important characteristic of hormones is that only minute amounts are required to induce substantial change in an organism. Hormone concentrations or the rates of their transport can change in response to environmental stimuli. Often the response of a plant is governed by the interaction of two or more hormones.
