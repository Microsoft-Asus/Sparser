ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">A suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings that killed more than 250 people in East Africa was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to Kenyan authorities</ENAMEX> , bypassing U.S. investigators , the Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said Sunday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The suspect , identified as Mohammad Sadik Howaida , was arrested on his arrival from Nairobi at the Karachi airport on August 7 , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said .
That was the day of the nearly simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .</ENAMEX>
A government source speaking on condition of anonymity said he was returned to Nairobi a week later .
The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused immediate comment .
The government source said <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">the suspect told his interrogators that a few other conspirators , who left Nairobi earlier , had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
He had planned to do the same , he said .
The source told The Associated Press that <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">investigators suspected a link between Howaida and Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> , who has been living in neighboring Afghanistan for the last two years .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. officials have said that bin Laden , who has been vocal in his hatred of the United States and is among the world 's most militant sponsors of terrorism , was a possible suspect in the African bombings</ENAMEX> .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said immigration officials determined that Howaida 's Yemeni passport was forged , and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts , he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan authorities for appropriate action under their law</ENAMEX> , '' Altaf said , adding that Howaida was sent to Nairobi aboard a special plane .
A foreign ministry statement identified Howaida as an `` Arab national '' without elaboration , a phrase that in Pakistan usually means someone from anywhere in the Middle East .
A day earlier , U.S. authorities in Washington said CIA agents were headed to Pakistan to question the man .
But Altaf said no foreigners were allowed to interrogate Howaida .
The government source said Pakistani officials refused U.S. officials who came to Karachi access to the suspect , and they had to follow him to Kenya on another plane .
When Mir Aimal Kasi , a Pakistani later convicted in the United States of killing two CIA employees , was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint FBI - Pakistani operation , angry Pakistanis accused their government of groveling before U.S. power .
The Kasi case could be one reason that Howaida was not directly handed over to the Americans , the source said .
The national newspaper The News , quoting unidentified government sources Sunday , said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">the suspect confessed to planning the bombings</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The News said he had received help in Kenya from sympathizers with connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization</ENAMEX> .
Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad , or Islamic Holy War .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Before the bombings , a group known as the Islamic Jihad reportedly vowed to strike America interests</ENAMEX> because some of its members were arrested in Albania .
That group is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 .
