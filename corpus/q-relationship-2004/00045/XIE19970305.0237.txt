ROME , March 4 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Italy 's Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano confirmed today the mafia in the country 's southern city of Naples has infiltrated northern regions .
The Neapolitan mafia has been transformed in recent years since the judicial system and law enforcement agencies stepped up fight against organized crime , Napolitano told senators .
The old criminal structure of the mafia , known as the Camorra since the 1820s , has been `` shattered , '' he said .
However , the minister noted , main criminal groups in the southern Italian port city have regrouped to manage `` the most prominent business areas like arms and drug trafficking . ''
The Camorra has also infiltrated the industrial north , Napolitano said , suggesting that nobody should fool themselves into thinking that the Mafia operated only in the south .
As a result , rival gangs launched turf wars that have led to more mafia-related murders since 1996 .
Of the 139 murders in the year , 87 involved a mafia-related victim .
And so far in 1997 , there has been 19 mafia-related murders .
Meanwhile , Napolitano said , smaller gangs had gotten involved in a wider range of criminal activities , from smuggling to illegal gambling .
