WASHINGTON , October 15 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Cassini , the probe destined for Saturn , took off early this morning on a seven-year journey to explore the remote planet and its rings and moons .
As the largest , most expensive interplanetary craft ever assembled in the United States , it took a hike into space aboard a Titan 4- B rocket blasting off from Cape Canaveral , Florida .
Delayed for weeks amid protests against a potential radioactive catastrophe from Cassini 's plutonium power source , the launch took place at 04 : 43 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time , or 08 : 43 GMT .
But preparation for the interplanetary mission , with a record high 32 kilograms of the extremely poisonous nuclear fuel loaded into the craft , took 11 years and cost 3.4 billion U.S. dollars .
Officials with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration -LRB- NASA -RRB- said a radioactive leak is unlikely , even if an accident happens and showers the earth with the probe 's debris .
As precautions , the plutonium is in hardened ceramic pellets encased in heat-resistant iridium and graphite to keep it from being pulverized and dispersed into the atmosphere in an explosion .
On its billions of kilometers flight toward Saturn , Cassini is scheduled to loop its path around the Venus , the Earth and the Jupiter to get the gravity boost needed for closing in onto its destination .
Ground controllers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , are to monitor the probe 's track throughout the entire space odyssey .
