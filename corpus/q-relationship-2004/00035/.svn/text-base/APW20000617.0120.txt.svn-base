CARACAS , Venezuela
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday denied a former ally 's accusations that his government provided arms to leftist guerrillas in neighboring Colombia .
Chavez called the allegations by former police chief Jesus Urdaneta `` absolutely false '' during a news conference in the town of La Fria , on the border with Colombia .
`` It 's irresponsible to accuse me of being implicated in this type of activity when my only interest has been promoting peace , '' he said .
`` I have never wanted to intervene in the internal affairs of Colombia . ''
Urdaneta joined Chavez in a failed 1992 coup attempt .
After Chavez was elected president in December 1998 , Urdaneta was named chief of Venezuela 's Investigation and Prevention Services Directorate , a national police force with intelligence-gathering functions .
Urdaneta left the government in January .
He is now a candidate for governor of the central coastal state of Aragua and an ally of Francisco Arias , Chavez 's main opponent in an upcoming presidential election .
In a radio interview Friday , Urdaneta said Chavez had urged government support for the rebels .
`` While I was in charge of the -LRB- political police -RRB- , Chavez suggested supporting the Colombian guerrillas with weapons , a position that I opposed vehemently , '' he said .
Urdaneta alleged that Chavez ordered a former interior minister to funnel some $ 300,000 to rebels in Colombia .
He said Chavez 's party sent arms to the rebels .
He also accused Chavez of preventing a police raid on an office of Chavez 's party where investigators believed weapons were stored .
Chavez denied the allegations .
`` I hope -LRB- Urdaneta -RRB- takes that back -- he ca n't be going around lying about things as delicate as this , '' he said .
Since taking office in February 1999 , Chavez has used his credentials as a left-leaning nationalist to urge an end to the 36-year conflict between the Colombian government and leftist rebels .
He also has offered to mediate negotiations .
