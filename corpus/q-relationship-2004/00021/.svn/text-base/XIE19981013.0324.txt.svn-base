CAIRO , October 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Arab League -LRB- AL -RRB- is championing a campaign to resolve the Lockerbie issue and ultimately have the embargo clamped on Libya lifted , the Middle East News Agency reported Monday .
Ahmad Bin Holei , AL Assistant Secretary General for Arab Affairs , said that the league is coordinating the move with the Organization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB- , United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and the countries concerned with the Lockerbie issue : the United States , Britain and the Netherlands .
During a meeting here Monday with a visiting delegation from the African Journalists Union , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Holei said the AL 's resolution on the Lockerbie issue , and that of the OAU , both aim at ending the sanctions against Libya</ENAMEX> .
The embargo was imposed in 1992 to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people were killed .
The AL said in September that it would break the sanctions as soon as the U.S. , Britain and Libya agree on measures to put the two Libyan suspects on trial in the Netherlands .
Until then , its member countries should adhere to the embargo .
The Arab diplomat referred to the league 's backing of Libya 's demands that the two suspects be guaranteed a fair trial and that Libya be awarded compensation to make up for the damage it suffered during long years of embargo .
`` As soon as the parties concerned agree to the guarantees Libya is seeking for its two men before they stand trial , the embargo on Libya is suspended , '' he said .
Holei condemned the `` continued policy of double measures '' by the U.S. and the U.N. towards Arab countries , as is `` manifest in imposing economic sanctions against some Arab states without international legitimacy and justification . ''
Libya has rejected a new U.S. - British decision to accept the trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should they be convicted .
The U.S. and Britain , who had been demanding extradition of the Libyans to either of them , insisted that their offer is non-negotiable .
Tripoli decided last month to disband its Ministry of Promoting Arab Unity in a few weeks , a move showing its displeasure over Arab failure to have the U.N. sanctions lifted .
