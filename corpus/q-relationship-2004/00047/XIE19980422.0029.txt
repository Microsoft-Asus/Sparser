NEW YORK , April 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Major oil producing countries around the world have been trying to prop up oil prices by cutting production output , but analysts doubt the results .
The deal was significant because it included seven big non- OPEC -LRB- Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -RRB- members such as Mexico , Norway and Russia , according to an article carried by the Investor 's Business Daily today .
Analysts said , however , the agreement reached last month to cut about 1.5 million barrels a day is not enough to wipe out the entire daily surplus .
They believe even if all the participants stick to their commitments , the world will still be awash in oil .
Most important , analysts do n't believe all members of the OPEC -plus pact will live up to their promises .
Over the past two decades , OPEC countries have made pact after pact defining members ' output quotas .
But , as it has been revealed all the time , cheating is rampant , according to the paper .
The latest plunge in oil prices started in the fall , as OPEC agreed to boost production by 10 percent .
At about the same time , the Asian Crisis reduced the demand for oil in that region .
Meanwhile , a mild winter reduced energy needs in the rest of the world .
Although restricted supply could prop up oil prices , many countries have their own reasons not to do so .
Many governments depend on national oil companies for a large portion of their budgets , it said .
Getting all of those parties to agree to a deal , let alone stick to it , is extremely difficult , the paper said .
Chances are someone is going to pump out more oil .
If the price of oil is high enough , users cut back on their consumption , and new companies will enter the market , sending prices lower .
But Even as world economic activity and the demand for oil have expanded significantly over the past 20 years , proven oil reserves have continued to grow .
Low prices eventually will lead to increased demand , according to market analysts .
Oil companies will lose interest in expensive and uncertain exploration projects , which will lead to less new supply .
Those changes , in turn , will lead to higher prices .
