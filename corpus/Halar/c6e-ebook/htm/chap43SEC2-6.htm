Recall that class II MHC molecules, the ones recognized by helper T cells, are found only on certain cell types, mainly those that engulf foreign antigens. These antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and some B cells, tell the immune system, via helper T cells, that foreign antigen is in the body. For example, a macrophage that has engulfed and broken down a bacterium contains small fragments of bacterial proteins. As a newly made class II MHC molecule moves toward the macrophage surface, it captures one of these bacterial peptides in its antigen-binding groove and carries it to the surface, revealing the foreign peptide to a helper T cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.11</span>, p. 910). The interaction between an APC and a helper T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called <span class="Emphasis2">CD4.</span> Present on most helper T cells, CD4 binds to part of the class II MHC protein. The interaction between CD4 and a class II MHC molecule helps keep the helper T cell and the APC joined while activation of the T<SUB>H</SUB> cell occurs.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig43-11','../fig/big/fig43-11.jpg','fig43-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig43-11.jpg" alt="fig43-11" name="myfig43-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 43-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The central role of helper T cells: a <span class="Emphasis1">closer look</span>.</span> Helper T cells mobilize both humoral and cell-mediated branches of the immune response.

Activated helper T cells secrete several different <span class="Emphasis2">cytokines,</span> proteins or peptides that stimulate other lymphocytes. For example, the cytokine <span class="Emphasis2">interleukin-2 (IL-2)</span> helps B cells that have contacted antigen differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL-2 also helps cytotoxic T cells become active killers.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The helper T cell itself is also subject to regulation by cytokines. As a macrophage phagocytoses and presents antigen, the macrophage is stimulated to secrete a cytokine called <span class="Emphasis2">interleukin-1 (IL-1).</span> IL-1, in combination with the presented antigen, is what activates the helper T cell to produce IL-2 and other cytokines. Also, in an example of positive feedback, IL-2 secreted by the helper T cell stimulates that same cell to proliferate more rapidly and to become an even more active cytokine producer. In these ways, helper T cells modulate both humoral (B cell) and cell-mediated (cytotoxic T cell) immune responses.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
