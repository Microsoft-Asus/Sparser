The hybrids (F<SUB>1</SUB>) exhibited the dominant trait. In the next generation (F<SUB>2</SUB>), 75%  of offspring had the dominant trait and 25%  had the recessive trait, for a 3:1 ratio. Mendel’s explanation was that genes have alternative forms (now called alleles) and that each organism inherits one allele for each gene from each parent. These separate (segregate) during gamete formation, so that a sperm or an egg carries only one allele. After fertilization, if the two alleles of a gene are different, one (the dominant allele) is expressed in the offspring and the other (the recessive allele) is masked. Homozygous individuals have identical alleles for a given character and are true-breeding. Heterozygous individuals have two different alleles for a given character.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity14A:<span class="Emphasis1">

In epistasis, one gene affects the expression of another gene. Certain characters are quantitative; they vary continuously, indicating polygenic inheritance, an additive effect of two or more genes on a single phenotypic character. Quantitative characters also influenced by environment are said to be multifactorial.</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity14D:<span class="Emphasis1">
