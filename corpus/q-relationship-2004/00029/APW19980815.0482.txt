<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Pakistani newspapers say at least one suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa was detained in Pakistan as he tried to slip into neighboring Afghanistan</ENAMEX> .
The national newspaper The News , in a report appearing in its Sunday editions quoting unnamed government sources , said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">a suspect identified as 32-year -old Mohammed Sadique confessed to planning the bombings at the embassies in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .</ENAMEX>
The nearly simultaneous Aug. 7 attacks killed a total of 257 people .
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad and the State Department and FBI in Washington refused comment .
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said he had no knowledge of the case , as did Pakistani intelligence sources contacted by The Associated Press .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Suspicion had earlier focused on Afghanistan , home of Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. officials say bin Laden , among the world 's most militant sponsors of terrorism , was a possible suspect in the African bombings</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The News did not report whether Sadique was linked to bin Laden , his nationality , or whether he had offered a motive .
But it said he had received help in Kenya from sympathizers with connections to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization</ENAMEX> .
Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad , or Islamic Holy War .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Before the bombings , a group known as the Islamic Jihad considered the successor to the groups that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 , reportedly vowed to strike U.S. interests</ENAMEX> because some of its members had been arrested in Albania .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The News said Sadique was detained at the Karachi airport after his flight from Nairobi landed Aug. 7 , the day of the bombings</ENAMEX> , because immigration officials noticed he did not match the photograph in the passport he was carrying .
When he tried to bribe the officials , he was arrested , the newspaper said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">He reportedly confessed to the bombings under interrogation , and said two other conspirators who left Nairobi a few days earlier had already passed through Pakistan into Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , as he had planned to do .
Umat , a small Karachi newspaper that had reported Sadique 's arrest earlier in the week , said in a report Saturday that <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">the two other men to whom Sadique referred , identified only as Mohammed Saleh and Abdullah , were arrested later .</ENAMEX>
All three were brought to the capital for further questioning , according to the Urdu -language newspaper .
Umat , also unnamed sources , had few other details .
