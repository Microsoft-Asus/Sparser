Each new edition of this textbook requires revision of most of the phylogenetic trees to reflect the ongoing revolution in systematics. Phylogenetic trees and the classifications they inform, remember, are hypotheses about the history of life. And in the case of seed plant phylogeny, the data now support a tree with two main monophyletic branches--the gymnosperms and the angiosperms--as depicted in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 30.4</span>. Gymnosperms and angiosperms probably evolved from different ancestors in an extinct group of plants called <span class="Emphasis2">progymnosperms,</span> some of which had seeds.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig30-4','../fig/big/fig30-4.jpg','fig30-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig30-4.jpg" alt="fig30-4" name="myfig30-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 30-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Hypothetical phylogeny of the seed plants.</span> Recent research supports the division of the seed plants into two distinct clades (monophyletic branches), the gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, evolutionary relationships among the major groups within each of the two seed-plant clades is less certain, which is why the bases of those subbranches are broken lines in this diagram. The numbering of the seed-plant phyla in this tree corresponds to our introduction to plant diversity in Chapter 29, reviewed here in the inset. Note that the taxonomy adopted by this text recognizes four phyla of gymnosperms, but groups all angiosperms into a single phylum, Anthophyta.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The two key reproductive adaptations of seed plants--seeds and pollen--will seem less abstract once we have looked more closely at the diversity of gymnosperms and angiosperms.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
