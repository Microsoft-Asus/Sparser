The history of prokaryotic life is a success story spanning more than 3.5 billion years. Prokaryotes were the earliest organisms, and they lived and evolved all alone on Earth for 1.5 billion years. They have continued to adapt and flourish on an evolving Earth, and in turn they have helped to change the Earth. In this chapter, you will become more familiar with prokaryotes by studying their structure and function, their origins and evolution, their diversity, and their ecological significance.

Most prokaryotes are unicellular. However, some species tend to aggregate transiently in groups of two or more cells. Others have the form of true colonies, which are permanent aggregates of identical cells. And in some species of prokaryotes, there is even a division of labor between two or more specialized types of cells.

There is a diversity of cell shapes among prokaryotes, the three most common being spheres (cocci), rods (bacilli), and helices (including the bacteria known as spirilla and spirochetes). An important step in identifying prokaryotes is determining their shape by microscopic examination (FIGURE 27.3).

(a) Cocci (singular, coccus), or spherical prokaryotes, occur singly, in pairs (diplo cocci), in chains of many cells (streptococci, shown here), and in clusters resembling bunches of grapes (staphylococci). (b) Rod-shaped prokaryotes, or bacilli (singular, bacillus), are usually solitary, but in some forms the rods are arranged in chains. (c) Helical prokaryotes include the spirilla and the corkscrew-shaped spirochetes. (All colorized SEMs.)

Most prokaryotes have diameters in the range of 1-5 &uuml;m, compared to 10-100 &uuml;m for the majority of eukaryotic cells. There are, however notable exceptions; the largest prokaryote discovered so far measures about 0.75 mm in diameter, dwarfing most eukaryotic cells (FIGURE 27.4).

The two smaller cells above the bright one are dead. Researchers who discovered the giant prokaryote in 1997 named it Thiomargarita namibiensis, which means "sulfur pearl of Namibia." It uses sulfur compounds in its metabolism and inhabits coastal sediments in the African country of Namibia.

Metabolic diversity is greater among prokaryotes than among all eukaryotes combined. Every type of nutrition observed in eukaryotes is represented among prokaryotes, along with some nutritional modes unique to prokaryotes.

In this section, we'll take a closer look at the distinction between archaea and bacteria and then examine a few of the major groups within these two domains of prokaryotic organisms.

 Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases



 

 Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology



One of the themes of this unit is changing life on a changing planet--the relationship between geologic history and evolving biological forms. Organisms as pervasive, abundant, and diverse as the prokaryotes have had a tremendous impact on Earth and all its inhabitants.





 They're (almost) everywhere! An overview of prokaryotic life

Today, prokaryotes still dominate the biosphere. Their collective biological mass (biomass) outweighs all eukaryotes combined by at least tenfold. More prokaryotes inhabit a handful of fertile soil or the mouth or skin of a human than the total number of people who have ever lived. In the colorized scanning electron micrograph on this page, the tiny orange rods are bacteria on the point of a pin. (You can see from this micrograph why a pin prick can cause an infection, and why it's important to flame the tip of a needle to kill bacteria before using the needle to remove a splinter.)

Prokaryotes are found wherever there is life. They also thrive in habitats too cold, too hot, too salty, too acidic, or too alkaline for any eukaryote (FIGURE 27.1). In 1999, biologists even discovered prokaryotes growing on the walls of a gold mine 2 miles below Earth's surface.

Fig 27-1. "Heat-loving" prokaryotes. The vivid reds, oranges, and yellows that paint these rocks are colonies of prokaryotes that thrive in the extremely hot water (up to 104&#176;C) that flows from this Nevada geyser. Ranchers accidentally tapped the geyser when they were drilling for water in 1916.

Though individual prokaryotes are relatively small organisms, they are giants in their collective impact on Earth and its life. We hear most about a minority of species that cause serious illness. During the 14th century, Black Death--bubonic plague, a bacterial disease--spread across Europe, killing an estimated 25%  of the human population. Tuberculosis, cholera, many sexually transmissible diseases, and certain types of food poisoning are other human diseases caused by bacteria.

However, prokaryotic life is no rogues' gallery. Far more common than harmful bacteria are those that are benign or beneficial. Bacteria in our intestines provide us with important vitamins, and others living in our mouth prevent harmful fungi from growing there. Prokaryotes also cycle carbon and other vital chemical elements back and forth between organic matter and the soil and atmosphere. For example, there are prokaryotes that decompose dead organisms. Found in soil and at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceans, these decomposers return chemical elements to the environment in the form of inorganic compounds that can be used by plants, which in turn feed animals. If prokaryotic decomposers were to disappear, the chemical cycles that sustain life would break down. All forms of eukaryotic life would also be doomed. In contrast, prokaryotic life would undoubtedly persist in the absence of eukaryotes, as it once did for 1.5 billion years.

Prokaryotes often live in close associations with other prokaryotes and with eukaryotes in what are called symbiotic relationships. In the most historically important case of such symbiosis, mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes that became residents within larger host cells. Thus, animals, plants, fungi, and protists evolved from symbiotic associations of ancestral cells. (We will examine this theory of eukaryotic origins further in Chapter 28.)

Modern prokaryotes are diverse in structure and metabolism. About 5,000 species of prokaryotes are known, and estimates of actual prokaryotic diversity range from about 400,000 to 4 million species. As Harvard University biologist E.O. Wilson puts it, a true sense of biodiversity requires a "downward adjustment of scale."





 Bacteria and archaea are the two main branches of prokaryote evolution

In the traditional five-kingdom system of classification, prokaryotes make up the kingdom Monera, and the four eukaryotic kingdoms are Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia (see FIGURE 26.15). This scheme emphasizes the structural differences between the cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the past two decades, however, systematists have determined that a single kingdom incorporating all prokaryotes is not consistent with evolutionary history. By comparing ribosomal RNA and the completely sequenced genomes of several extant (living today) species, researchers have identified two major branches of prokaryote evolution. The names for these two groups are bacteria and archaea. The term archaea refers to the antiquity of the group's origin from the earliest cells (from the Greek archaio, ancient). Many species of archaea inhabit extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt ponds. Few, if any, other modern organisms can survive in these environments, which may resemble habitats on the early Earth. Archaea differ from bacteria in many key structural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics, differences that will be highlighted later in this chapter.

When researchers led by Carl Woese, of the University of Illinois, first recognized the distinction between bacteria and archaea, they proposed a six-kingdom system: two prokaryotic kingdoms along with the four eukaryotic kingdoms. Because bacteria and archaea diverged so early in the history of life and are so fundamentally different, Woese and many other systematists now favor organizing the diversity of life into three domains, a taxonomic level above kingdom (FIGURE 27.2). In this view, prokaryotes account for two of the domains: domain Bacteria and domain Archaea.

Fig 27-2. The three domains of life. This phylogenetic tree represents the hypothesis that the two major prokaryotic groups diverged very early and that Archaea is more closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria. In Chapter 28, we'll see how new data are stimulating some remodeling of this hypothesis.

Taxonomic issues aside, bacteria and archaea are both structurally organized at the prokaryotic level, which is the rationale for combining them in this chapter. The distinction between bacteria and archaea will become more apparent after we examine some of the structural, genetic, and metabolic adaptations that contribute to the pervasiveness of prokaryotes on Earth.





 Nearly all prokaryotes have a cell wall external to the plasma membrane

Present in nearly all prokaryotes, the cell wall maintains the shape of the cell, affords physical protection, and prevents the cell from bursting in a hypotonic environment (see Chapter 8). Like other walled cells, however, prokaryotes plasmolyze (shrink away from their wall) and may die in a hypertonic medium, which is why heavily salted meat can be kept so long without being spoiled by prokaryotes. The cell walls of prokaryotes differ in molecular composition and construction from those of plants, fungi, and protists.

The presence of a cell wall is one reason prokaryotes were grouped with plants in the old two-kingdom system. Instead of cellulose, the staple of plant walls, most bacterial walls contain a unique material called peptidoglycan, which consists of polymers of modified sugars cross-linked by short polypeptides that vary from species to species (the walls of archaea lack peptidoglycan). The effect is a single molecular network enclosing and protecting the entire cell. External to this fabric are other substances that also differ from species to species.

One of the most valuable tools for identifying specific bacteria is the Gram stain, which can be used to separate many species into two groups based on differences in their cell walls. Gram-positive bacteria have simpler walls, with a relatively large amount of peptidoglycan. The walls of gram-negative bacteria have less peptidoglycan and are structurally more complex. An outer membrane on the gram-negative cell wall contains lipopolysaccharides, carbohydrates bonded to lipids (FIGURE 27.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-5. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Gram-staining, named for Hans Christian Gram, a Danish physician who developed the technique in the late 1800s, dis tinguishes between two different kinds of bacterial cell walls. Bacteria are stained with a violet dye and iodine, rinsed in alcohol, and then stained again with a red dye. The structure of the cell wall determines the staining response. (The colors in the diagrams do not represent the stains.)

Among pathogenic, or disease-causing, bacteria, gram-negative species are generally more threatening than gram-positive species. The lipopolysaccharides on the walls of gram-negative bacteria are often toxic, and the outer membrane helps protect the pathogens against the defenses of their hosts. Furthermore, gram-negative bacteria are commonly more resistant than gram-positive species to antibiotics because the outer membrane impedes entry of the drugs.

Many antibiotics, including penicillins, inhibit the synthesis of cross-links in peptidoglycan and prevent the formation of a functional wall, particularly in gram-positive species. These drugs are like selective bullets that cripple many species of infectious bacteria without adversely affecting humans and other eukaryotes, which do not make peptidoglycan.

Many prokaryotes secrete sticky substances that form still another protective layer called a capsule outside the cell wall. Capsules enable the organisms to adhere to their substratum and provide additional protection, including increased resistance of pathogenic prokaryotes to host defenses. Gelatinous capsules glue together the cells of many prokaryotes that live as colonies.

Another way some prokaryotes adhere to one another or to some substratum is by means of surface appendages called pili (singular, pilus; FIGURE 27.6, p. 530). For example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhea, uses pili to fasten itself to mucous membranes of its host. Some pili are specialized for holding prokaryotes together long enough for the cells to transfer DNA during conjugation (see Chapter 18).

Fig 27-6. Pili. These appendages enable some prokaryotes to attach to surfaces or to other prokaryotes (colorized TEM). Some pili function during conjugation, holding partners together while DNA is transferred (see FIGURE 18.14).





 Many prokaryotes are motile

About half of all prokaryotes are capable of directional movement. Some species exceed speeds of 50 &uuml;m/sec, or about 100 times their body length per second.

Flagellar action is the most common mechanism of movement among prokaryotes. Flagella may be scattered over the entire cell surface or concentrated at one or both ends of the cell. The flagella of prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ in both structure and function. (To review eukaryotic flagella, see Chapter 7.) Prokaryotic flagella are one-tenth the width of eukaryotic flagella and are not covered by an extension of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 27.7).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-7. Form and function of prokaryotic flagella. Chains of a globular protein, flagellin, are wound in a tight spiral to form a semirigid, helical filament. The filament is attached to another protein that forms a curved hook, which is inserted into a basal apparatus. Composed of about 35 different proteins, the basal apparatus includes a system of rings in the layers of the cell wall (TEM). (The structures shown in this figure are characteristic of gram-negative bacteria.) The basal apparatus--the flagellar motor--rotates the filament, which propels the cell. The motor is powered by the diffusion of protons (H+) into the cell after they have been pumped outward by ATP-powered proton pumps embedded in the plasma membrane.

A second motility mechanism characterizes a group of helix-shaped bacteria called spirochetes. Two or more helical filaments just under the outer sheath of the cell wall are much like prokaryotic flagella in structure. Each has a basal motor attached at one end of the cell. When the filaments rotate, the flexible cell moves like a corkscrew.

In a third mechanism of motility, some prokaryotes that form filamentous chains of cells secrete slimy threads that anchor to the substratum. As the cells continue to secrete jets of slime, the filamentous prokaryote glides along at the growing end of the threads.

In a relatively uniform environment, flagellated prokaryotes may wander randomly. In a heterogeneous environment, however, many prokaryotes are capable of taxis, movement toward or away from a stimulus (from the Greek taxis, to arrange). With chemotaxis, for example, prokaryotes respond to chemical stimuli, perhaps moving toward food or oxygen (a positive chemotaxis) or away from some toxic substance (a negative chemotaxis). Several kinds of receptor molecules that detect specific substances are located on the surfaces of chemotactic prokaryotes. Motile prokaryotes that are photosynthetic generally display a positive phototaxis, a behavior that keeps them in the light. Some prokaryotes even contain a row of tiny magnetic particles that allow the cells to orient in Earth's magnetic field. These particles may help cells distinguish up from down and cause the prokaryotes to migrate toward the nutrient-rich sediments at the bottoms of ponds and shallow seas.





 The cellular and genomic organization of prokaryotes is fundamentally different from that of eukaryotes

Recall that prokaryotes are named for their lack of true nuclei enclosed by membranes (see FIGURE 7.4). The cells of prokaryotes lack the extensive compartmentalization by internal membranes characteristic of eukaryotes. However, various prokaryotes do have a variety of specialized membranes that perform many of their metabolic functions. These membranes are usually infolded regions of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 27.8).

Fig 27-8. Specialized membranes of prokaryotes. (a) These infoldings of the plasma membrane, reminiscent of the cristae of mitochondria, function in cellular respiration of some aerobic pro karyotes (TEM). (b) Photosynthetic prokaryotes called cyanobacteria have thylakoid membranes, much like those in chloroplasts (TEM).

Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes also have smaller, simpler genomes. On average, prokaryotes have only about one-thousandth as much DNA as a eukaryotic cell. In most prokaryotes, the DNA is concentrated as a snarl of fibers in a nucleoid region that stains less densely than the surrounding cytoplasm in electron micrographs. The mass of fibers is actually the prokaryotic chromosome, one double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a ring. The DNA has relatively little protein associated with it. The term genophore is sometimes used for the bacterial chromosome to distinguish it from eukaryotic chromosomes, which have a very different structure. The genome of eukaryotes consists of linear DNA molecules packaged along with proteins into multiple chromosomes.

In addition to its one major chromosome, the prokaryotic cell may also have much smaller rings of DNA called plasmids, most consisting of only a few genes. In most environments, prokaryotes can survive without their plasmids because all essential functions are programmed by the chromosome. However, plasmids endow the cell with genes for resistance to antibiotics, for the metabolism of unusual nutrients not present in the normal environment, and for other special contingencies. Plasmids replicate independently of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between partners when prokaryotes conjugate (see FIGURE 18.15).

Although the general processes for DNA replication and the translation of genetic messages into proteins are alike for eukaryotes and prokaryotes, some of the details differ. For example, the prokaryotic ribosome is slightly smaller than the eukaryotic version and differs in its protein and RNA content. The disparity is great enough that selective antibiotics, including tetracycline and chloramphenicol, bind to the ribosomes and block protein synthesis in many prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes.





 Populations of prokaryotes grow and adapt rapidly

Prokaryotes reproduce only asexually by the mode of cell division called binary fission, synthesizing DNA almost continuously (see FIGURE 12.10). A single prokaryotic cell in a favorable environment will give rise by repeated divisions to a colony of offspring (FIGURE 27.9). Note that neither mitosis nor meiosis occurs among prokaryotes; this is another fundamental difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Fig 27-9. Prokaryote colonies in culture. Microbiologists grow laboratory cultures of prokaryotes in liquid or solid media of known composition. The media, in containers such as petri dishes or test tubes, are sterilized to ensure that no unwanted microbes will grow. Then a sample of prokaryotes, sometimes just a single cell, is introduced, and the containers are incubated at an appropriate temperature. When the prokaryotes are grown on solid media, colonies are usually large enough to be visible to the unaided eye after a day or two. The size, shape, texture, and color of a colony provide clues to the identity of the prokaryotes, as do the nutrients and physical conditions required for their growth.

Although prokaryotes are never sexual in the eukaryotic manner of the meiosis-fertilization cycle, they do have three mechanisms that transfer genes between individuals (see Chapter 18). In transformation, a prokaryotic cell takes up genes from the surrounding environment, allowing for considerable genetic transfer between pro ka ryotes, even across species lines. Conjugation is the direct transfer of genes from one prokaryote to another. And in transduction, viruses transfer genes between prokaryotes. These processes, however, involve the unilateral passage of a variable amount of DNA--nothing like the meiotic sex of eukaryotes, in which two parents each contribute homologous genomes to a zygote. Mutation is the major source of genetic variation in prokaryotes. Because generation times are measured in minutes or hours, a favorable mutation can be rapidly propagated to a large number of offspring. This enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change, as natural selection screens new mutations and novel genomes resulting from gene transfer.

The word growth as applied to prokaryotes refers more to the multiplication of cells and an increase in population size than to the enlargement of individual cells. The conditions for optimal growth--temperature, pH, salt concentrations, nutrient sources, and so on--vary according to species. Refrigeration retards food spoilage because most micro or gan isms grow only very slowly at such low temperatures.

In an environment with unlimited resources, the growth of prokaryotes is effectively geometric: One cell divides to form 2, which divide again to produce a total of 4 cells, then 8, 16, and so on, the number of cells in a colony doubling with each generation. Many prokaryotes have generation times in the range of 1-3 hours, but some species can double every 20 minutes in an optimal environment. If the latter growth rate were sustained, a single cell would give rise to a colony outweighing Earth in just three days! Obviously, prokaryotic growth both in the laboratory and in nature is usually checked at some point, when the cells exhaust some nutrient or the colony poisons itself with an accumulation of metabolic wastes. Still, prokaryotes manage to reach astounding population densities--a hundred billion prokaryotes per milliliter of fluid in the human colon, for example.

The ability of some prokaryotes to withstand harsh conditions is also impressive. Some bacteria form resistant cells called endospores (FIGURE 27.10). The original cell replicates its chromosome, and one copy becomes surrounded by a durable wall. The outer cell disintegrates, leaving the highly resistant endospore. Boiling water is not hot enough to kill most endospores in a relatively short length of time. Home canners and the food-canning industry, therefore, must take extra precautions to kill endospores of dangerous bacteria. To sterilize media, glassware, and utensils in the laboratory, microbiologists use an appliance called an autoclave, a pressure cooker that kills even endospores by heating to a temperature of 120&#176;C. In less hostile environments, endospores may remain dormant for centuries or more. If placed in a hospitable environment, they will hydrate and revive to the vegetative (colony-producing) state. For example, in 2000, researchers revived a bacterial spore that had apparently been encased for 250 million years in a salt formation within New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns.

Fig 27-10. An anthrax endospore. This prokaryote is Bacillus anthracis, the notorious bacterium that produces the deadly disease called anthrax in cattle, sheep, and humans (TEM). The outer cell produced the specialized inner cell, called an endospore. The endospore has a thick, protective coat. Its cytoplasm is dehydrated, and the cell does not metabolize. Under harsh conditions, the outer cell may disintegrate, but the endospore survives all sorts of trauma, including lack of water and nutrients, extreme heat or cold, and most poisons. When the environment becomes more hospitable, the endospore absorbs water and resumes growth. In late 2001, one or more bio terrorists disseminated anthrax spores through the U.S. postal system.

In most natural environments, prokaryotes must compete for space and nutrients. Many microorganisms (including certain species of prokaryotes, protists, and fungi) release antibiotics, chemicals that inhibit the growth of other microorganisms. Humans have discovered some of these compounds and use them to combat pathogenic bacteria.





 Prokaryotes can be grouped into four categories according to how they obtain energy and carbon

Nutrition refers here to how an organism obtains two resources from the environment: energy and a carbon source to build the organic molecules of cells. Species that use light energy are called phototrophs. Chemotrophs obtain their energy from chemicals taken from the environment. If an organism needs only the inorganic compound CO2 as a carbon source, it is called an autotroph. Heterotrophs require at least one organic nutrient--glucose, for instance--as a source of carbon for making other organic compounds. We can combine the phototroph-versus-chemotroph (energy source) and autotroph-versus-heterotroph (carbon source) criteria to group prokaryotes according to four major modes of nutrition:

Photoautotrophs are photosynthetic organisms that harness light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Among the diverse groups of photoautotrophic prokaryotes are the cyanobacteria. All photosynthetic eukaryotes--plants and algae--also fit into this nutritional category.

Chemoautotrophs need only CO2 as a carbon source, but instead of using light for energy, these prokaryotes obtain energy by oxidizing inorganic substances. Chemical energy is extracted from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), ferrous ions (Fe2+), or some other chemical, depending on the species. This mode of nutrition is unique to certain prokaryotes. Some of the species that extract energy by oxidizing minerals in stone are "eating away" at some of the world's greatest statues.

Photoheterotrophs can use light to generate ATP but must obtain their carbon in organic form. This mode of nutrition is restricted to certain prokaryotes.

Chemoheterotrophs must consume organic molecules for both energy and carbon. This nutritional mode is found widely among prokaryotes, protists, fungi, animals, and even some parasitic plants.

TABLE 27.1 reviews the four major modes of nutrition.

The majority of known prokaryotes are chemoheterotrophs. This category includes saprobes, decomposers that absorb their nutrients from dead organic matter, and parasites, which absorb their nutrients from the body fluids of living hosts.

The specific organic nutrients needed for growth vary extensively among chemoheterotrophic prokaryotes. Some species are very exacting in their requirements; for example, bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus will grow well only in a medium containing all 20 amino acids, several vitamins, and other organic compounds. Among species less particular in their nutritional needs, E. coli can grow on a medium containing glucose as the only organic ingredient, and the organism's metabolism is so versatile that many other compounds can substitute for glucose as the sole organic nutrient.

There is such a diversity of chemoheterotrophs that almost any organic molecule can serve as food for at least some species. For example, some bacteria are capable of metabolizing petroleum; they are used to clean up oil spills. Those few classes of synthetic organic compounds (including some kinds of plastics) that cannot be broken down by any chemohetero trophs are said to be nonbiodegradable.

Nitrogen Metabolism

Nitrogen metabolism is another area of nutritional diversity among prokaryotes. Nitrogen is an essential component of proteins and nucleic acids. While animals, plants, and other eukaryotes are limited in the forms of nitrogen they can use, diverse prokaryotes are able to metabolize most nitrogenous compounds.

Key steps in the cycling of nitrogen through ecosystems are performed only by prokaryotes. (For an overview of the nitrogen cycle, see FIGURE 54.18.) Some chemoautotrophic bacteria in the soil, such as Nitrosomonas, convert ammonium (NH4+) to nitrite (NO2-). Other bacteria, such as a few species of Pseudomonas, "denitrify" soil nitrite or nitrate (NO3-), a metabolism that returns nitrogen gas (N2) to the atmosphere. And diverse species of prokaryotes, including some cyanobacteria, are able to use atmospheric nitrogen directly as a source of nitrogen. In this process, called nitrogen fixation, prokaryotes convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonium (NH4+). Nitrogen fixation, unique to certain prokaryotes, is the only biological mechanism that makes atmospheric nitrogen available to organisms for incorporation into organic compounds. In terms of nutrition, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of all organisms. These photo autotrophs require only light energy, CO2, N2, water, and some minerals in order to grow (FIGURE 27.11).

Fig 27-11. One of the most independent organisms on Earth. A photoautotroph that can use atmospheric nitrogen (N2) as its nitrogen source, Anabaena is an example of the metabolic virtuosity of cyanobacteria. The specialized cells with the enzymes for nitrogen fixation are called heterocysts (LM).

Metabolic Relationships to Oxygen

Another metabolic variation among prokaryotes is in the effect that oxygen has on growth (see Chapter 9). Obligate aerobes use O2 for cellular respiration and cannot grow without it. Facultative anaerobes will use O2 if it is present but can also grow by fermentation in an anaerobic environment. Obligate anaerobes are poisoned by O2. Some obligate anaerobes live exclusively by fermentation; other species extract chemical energy by anaerobic respiration, in which inorganic molecules other than O2 accept electrons at the "downhill" end of electron transport chains.

Now that we have surveyed variation in nutrition and metabolism among prokaryotes, let's trace the evolutionary roots of this metabolic diversity.





 Photosynthesis evolved early in prokaryotic life

All forms of nutrition and nearly all metabolic pathways evolved among prokaryotes before there were any eukaryotes. As early prokaryotes evolved, they were met with constantly changing physical and biological environments. In response to these changes, new metabolic capabilities evolved that in turn changed the environment faced by the next community of prokaryotes. All the major metabolic capabilities seen among prokaryotes (and hence among eukaryotes) probably evolved in the first billion years of life. And during this expansion of metabolic diver sity, photosynthesis evolved relatively early--a hypothesis supported by molecular systematics, comparisons of energy me tabolism among extant prokaryotes, and geologic evidence.

The energy metabolism of even the simplest photoauto trophs is relatively complex. Thus, it seems reasonable to postulate that the very first prokaryotes were heterotrophs that obtained their energy and carbon skeletons from the pool of organic molecules available in the "primordial soup" of early Earth (see Chapter 26). Glycolysis, which can extract energy from organic fuels to generate ATP in anaerobic environments, was probably one of the first metabolic pathways. That would account for the existence of glycolysis in almost every group of modern organisms. As heterotrophs depleted the supply of organic nutrients in the environment, natu ral selection would have favored any prokaryotes that could harness the energy of sunlight to drive the synthesis of ATP and generate reducing power to synthesize organic compounds from CO2.

What evidence is there for an early evolution of photosynthesis? First, photosynthetic groups are scattered among diverse branches of prokaryote phylogeny. It is possible that photosynthesis evolved independently many times in various prokaryotic lineages (FIGURE 27.12a). This seems unlikely, however, since the molecular machinery required for photosynthesis is very complex. Applying the principle of parsimony we dis cussed in Chapter 25, the most reasonable hypothesis is that photosynthesis originated once in an ancestor common to the diverse prokaryotic groups where we find photosynthesis today. The heterotrophic groups that are closely related to photosynthetic ones could represent a loss of photosynthetic ability during evolution (FIGURE 27.12b). This would explain molecular data suggesting that in nutritionally diverse taxa of prokaryotes, the autotrophic species are generally older lineages than the heterotrophic ones. Although the very first organisms may have been heterotrophs from which autotrophs evolved, the diversity of heterotrophs we observe today probably descended secondarily from photosynthetic ancestors.

Fig 27-12. Contrasting hypotheses for the taxonomic distribution of photosynthesis among prokaryotes.

Further evidence for an early origin of photosynthesis is the antiquity of cyanobacteria. These are the only autotrophic prokaryotes that release O2 by splitting water during their light reactions. The geologic evidence for accumulation of atmospheric oxygen beginning at least 2.7 billion years ago suggests that cyanobacteria were already a major part of the biosphere by then. And fossils of prokaryotes that look very much like modern cyanobacteria have been found in stromatolites as old as 3.5 billion years, pushing the possible origin of oxygenic photosynthesis back considerably further.

Oxygenic photosynthesis is especially complex because it requires two cooperative photosystems (see FIGURE 10.12). Some groups of modern prokaryotes perform a simpler mode of photosynthesis, using a single photosystem to extract electrons from compounds such as H2S instead of splitting water. But certain components of the photosynthetic machinery are common to such nonoxygenic photosynthesis and the oxygenic version in cyanobacteria. A logical inference is that cyanobacteria evolved from ancestors with simpler, nonoxygenic photosynthesis. This would push the origin of photosynthesis back very close to our earliest fossil evidence of life.

The evolution of cyanobacteria changed the Earth in a radical way, gradually transforming its atmosphere from a reducing one to an oxidizing one. In Chapter 25, we discussed how the oxygen revolution posed an environmental crisis for life, which originated in a mostly anaerobic world. The most elegant adaptation to the changing atmosphere was the evolution of cellular respiration, which uses the oxidizing power of O2 to increase the efficiency of fuel consumption. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are actually closely related, both using electron transport chains to generate proton gradients that power ATP synthase machines (see FIGURE 10.15). Given the early origin of photosynthesis, it is likely that cellular respiration evolved by modification of the photosynthetic equipment for a new function.

Now that we have applied this book's theme of evolution to the origin of metabolic diversity in prokaryotes, let's survey the diverse groups of archaea and bacteria that continue to have enormous impact on Earth and its life.





 Molecular systematics is leading to a phylogenetic classification of prokaryotes

A classification of prokaryotic life that reflects evolutionary history was impossible until the development of molecular systematics. Neither the fossil record nor comparative morphology are of much help in working out details of prokaryotic phylogeny. The major lineages diverged during the very early history of life and left a limited fossil record. And because prokaryotes are so structurally simple compared to macroscopic, eukaryotic organisms, comparing the structure of modern prokaryotic species does not turn up much in the way of derived characters that are useful in cladistic analysis (see Chapter 25).

The breakthrough came when Carl Woese and his colleagues, mentioned earlier, began to cluster contemporary prokaryotes into taxonomic groups based on comparisons of nucleic acid sequences. The molecular material that turned out to be particularly useful is the RNA found in the smaller of the two subunits of ribosomes. Because all cells have ribosomes, Woese reasoned that the gene for the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) has a history extending from the very first prokaryotes to the entire diversity of modern life. Each group of organisms has signature sequences, regions of its SSU-rRNA that have unique nucleotide sequences acquired by an accumulation of mutations in the ancestor of that taxonomic group. Thus, Woese found a way to define the very deepest branchings in the tree of life. FIGURE 27.13 (p. 536) diagrams the phylogeny of some of the major groups of prokaryotes as sorted by molecular systematics.

Fig 27-13. Some major groups of prokaryotes. This tentative phylogeny, like all such trees, is a hypothesis about evolutionary history. This simplified tree--consisting only of those prokaryotic groups that are discussed in this chapter--is based on molecular systematics, particularly comparisons of SSU-rRNA signature sequences. The groups shown here might be considered kingdoms within domains Bacteria and Archaea. However, many systematists prefer to wait for more data before assigning the groups to ranked taxonomic categories, such as kingdoms and phyla. This tree includes a "universal ancestor" common to all life, but we'll see evidence in Chapter 28 that the deepest branchings of life may have emerged not from a single ancestor but from an ancestral community of gene-swapping prokaryotes.

Before molecular systematics, prokaryotic taxonomy was based on such phenotypic characters as nutritional mode and gram-positive versus gram-negative staining behavior (see FIGURE 27.5). Such criteria remain useful for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in the clinical labs of hospitals. The telltale signs of a particular bacterial species cultured from a patient's blood or other body fluid may be its shape as viewed with a microscope, its response to the Gram stain, whether or not the pathogen is motile, and what nutrients are required to grow the bacteria on a culture medium. For the most part, however, these clinically useful phenotypes are a poor guide to phylogeny. We have seen, for example, how the various nutritional modes are scattered around the phylogenetic tree of prokaryotes. However, a few of the traditional phenotype-based groups do persist in a phylogenetic classification based on molecular methods. For instance, note in FIGURE 27.13 that the cyanobacteria and the spirochetes cluster into two distinct lineages in the prokaryotic phylogeny. And although the gram-positive bacteria are very diverse, they all cluster into a single major prokaryotic branch. However, the gram-negative bacteria are scattered throughout several lineages; there are even some species that are gram-negative in staining behavior but are now included in the taxon called "gram-positive," so named because most of its members are gram-positive.

Researchers have now sequenced the complete ge nomes of several prokaryotes, producing an enormous database that has supported most of the taxonomic conclusions based on SSU-rRNA comparison but has also produced some surprises. For example, in Chapter 28 we'll discuss how rampant gene swapping within early communities of prokaryotes left a record in the genomes of all modern organisms, including humans.





 Researchers are identifying a great diversity of archaea in extreme environments and in the oceans

Note again in FIGURE 27.13 the very early divergence into two main prokaryotic lineages that are now designated the domains Archaea and Bacteria. TABLE 27.2 (p. 537) summarizes some differences between these two main prokaryotic groups. The table includes the third domain of life, Eukarya, to reinforce the point made earlier that the archaea have at least as much in common with eukaryotes as they do with bacteria. However, the archaea also have many unique characteristics, which we would expect of a taxon that has followed a separate evolutionary path for so long.

However, much of the research so far on the archaea has focused not on their phylogeny, but on their ecology--on the ability of many archaea to live where no other life can. We can think of these creatures as extremophiles,"lovers" of extreme environments, such as the hot-water geyser shown in FIGURE 27.1. In addition to phylogenetic classification, it is useful to classify the extremeophiles into three groups based on environmental criteria: methanogens, extreme halophiles, and extreme thermophiles.

The methanogens are named for the unique way they obtain energy by using CO2 to oxidize H2, producing methane (CH4) as a waste product. Methanogens, among the strictest of anaerobes, are poisoned by oxygen. They live in swamps and marshes where other microbes have consumed all the oxygen; the methane that bubbles out at these sites is known as marsh gas. Methanogens are also important decomposers used in sewage treatment. Some farmers have experimented with the use of these microbes to convert garbage and dung to methane, a valuable fuel. Other species of methanogens inhabit the anaerobic environment within the guts of animals, playing an important role in the nutrition of cattle, termites, and other herbivores that subsist mainly on a diet of cellulose. This gas production does not normally bloat cows because the animals belch out large volumes of the methane. On a global scale, methanogens produce enough methane to play a major role in the greenhouse effect, an atmospheric phenomenon you will learn about in Chapter 54.

The extreme halophiles (from the Greek halo, salt, and philos, lover) live in such saline places as the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Some species merely tolerate salinity, whereas others actually require an environment ten times saltier than seawater to grow (FIGURE 27.14). Colonies of halophiles form a purple-red scum that owes its color to bacteriorhodopsin, a photosynthetic pigment very similar to the visual pigments in the retinas of our eyes.

Fig 27-14. Extreme halophiles. The colors of these seawater evaporating ponds at the edge of San Francisco Bay result from a dense growth of extreme halophiles that thrive in the ponds when the water reaches a salinity of 15-20% . (Before evaporation, the salinity of seawater is about 3% .) The ponds are used for commercial salt production; the salt-loving archaea are harmless.

As their name implies, the extreme thermophiles thrive in hot environments. The optimal conditions for most of these archaea are temperatures of 60-80&#176;C. Sulfolobus inhabits hot sulfur springs in Yellowstone National Park, obtaining its energy by oxidizing sulfur. Another sulfur-metabolizing thermophile lives in the 105&#176;C water near deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

Some researchers postulate that the very earliest prokaryotes to evolve were extreme thermophiles that inhabited hot environments similar to deep-sea vents. This would make it more historically accurate to consider most forms of life, including humans, as "cold adapted," rather than viewing the thermophilic archaea, which have continued to inhabit hot environments, as "extreme."

Until recently, researchers thought that archaea were prevalent organisms mainly in extreme environments where other life-forms were essentially absent. However, in the past decade, scientists have discovered that an abundance of marine archaea live among other forms of life in the more moderate habitats of the oceans.

To return to the phylogenetic classification in FIGURE 27.13, all the methanogens and halophiles fit into Euryarchaeota. (The word root "eury" means "broad," a reference here to the variety and habitat range of these prokaryotes.) This archaean group also includes some thermophiles, though most of the thermophilic species belong to Crenarchaeota. (The word root "cren" means "spring," as in hydrothermal vents.) Each of these two taxa also includes some of the newly discovered marine archaea.

Because bacteria have been the prokaryotic subjects of most research throughout the history of microbiology, much more is known about them than about the archaea. Now that the evolutionary and ecological importance of the archaea have come into focus, we can expect research on this domain to turn up many more surprises about the history of life and the roles of microbes in ecosystems.





 Most known prokaryotes are bacteria

The term bacteria was once synonymous with "prokaryotes," but molecular systematics changed that when it became clear that prokaryotic life is represented by two distinct domains. It's a bit confusing that the name Bacteria was reassigned as the title of just one prokaryotic domain, Archaea being the other. True, most of the known prokaryotes are bacteria, but the archaea may catch up now that there is so much interest in describing their diversity.

Every major mode of nutrition and metabolism is represented among the thousands of known species of bacteria. And as mentioned earlier, multiple nutritional types may be represented within a particular taxonomic group of bacteria. If you return to FIGURE 27.13, you'll see five major bacterial groups identified (we've omitted several other groups). As with the two main groups of archaea, the major bacterial taxa are now accorded kingdom status by some prokaryotic systematists. We've organized our description of these monophyletic groups (clades) into TABLE 27.3 (pp. 538-539).

Table 27-3. Five of the Major Clades of Bacteria

Group/DescriptionExampleProteobacteriaThis large and diverse clade of gram-negative bacteria includes photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, and hetero trophs. Proteobacteria include both anaerobic and aerobic species. Molecular systematists recognize five subgroups of proteo bacterial species.Alpha ProteobacteriaMany of the species in this group are closely associated with eukaryotic hosts, either as mutual symbionts or as parasites. For example, Rhizobium species live in nodules within the roots of legumes (plants of the pea/bean family), where the bacteria convert atmospheric N2 to compounds the host plant can use to make proteins. Species of the genus Agrobacterium are pathogens that cause tumors to form in plants; genetic engineers use these bacteria to carry foreign DNA into the genomes of crop plants (see FIGURE 20.19). The rickettsias, tiny even by bacterial standards, are pathogens that live within the cells of animals, causing such diseases as Rocky Mountain spotted fever in humans. Mitochondria, the sites of cellular respiration in eukaryotic cells, evolved from an aerobic alphas that inhabited a larger host cell, a phenomenon called endosymbiosis, which we will examine in detail in Chapter 28.



Rhizobium; the arrows point to the bacteria inside root cells of a legume (TEM)Beta ProteobacteriaThis nutritionally diverse group includes Nitrosomonas, soil bacteria that play an important role in nitrogen recycling within ecosystems by oxidizing ammonium (NH4+), producing nitrite (NO2-) as a waste product.Gamma ProteobacteriaAmong the photosynthetic members of this group are sulfur bacteria such as Chromatium, which split H2S as a source of electrons to make organic molecules. The yellow globules in the Chromatium cells in the photo are sulfur wastes from photosynthesis. Among the heterotrophic gammas are some pathogens, including Legionella, named for the discovery that it causes Legionnaires' disease. Other gammas are enterics (bacteria that inhabit animal intestines), including Salmonella, one of the microbes that causes food poisoning; Vibrio cholerae, the pathogen that causes cholera; and the famous Escherichia coli, a species from the human intestine. The presence of E. coli in the water supply is a sign of contamination with feces. You may remember E. coli as one of the most important research organisms in molecular biology and DNA tech nology (see Chapters 16 and 20).



Chromatium; the yellow globules are sulfur wastes from H2S-splitting photosynthesis (LM)Delta ProteobacteriaOne group of deltas, the myxobacteria, form the most elaborate colonies of all prokaryotes. The cells secrete a slimy substratum on which they glide through soil (myxa is Greek for "mucus"). When the soil dries out or food becomes scarce, the cells congregate and erect a bulbous "fruiting" body, which may be brightly colored and as large as a millimeter in diameter. The fruiting body releases resistant spores that become active and found new colonies in favorable environments. Another delta group, the bdellovibrios, are predators that attack other bacteria. A bdellovibrio charges its prey at a speed of 100 &uuml;m per second, which, relatively speaking, is like a human running about 600 km per hour, half the speed of sound! Then the predator turns into a bacterial drill, boring into its prey by spinning at 100 revolutions per second.

Helicobacter pylori, which causes stomach ulcers (colorized TEM)ChlamydiasThese parasites can survive only within the cells of animals, depending on their hosts for resources as basic as ATP. The gram-negative walls of chlamydias are unusual among bacteria in that they lack peptidoglycan. One species, Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most common cause of blindness in the world and also causes nongonococcal urethritis, the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.



Chlamydias (arrows) living inside an animal cell (colorized TEM)SpirochetesSome of these helical heterotrophs are 0.25 mm long, though too thin to be visible without a microscope. Rotation of internal flagellum-like filaments produces a corkscrewlike movement. Many spirochetes are free- living, but the group also includes some notorious pathogens: Treponema pallidum causes the STD syphilis, and Borrelia burgdorferi is the pathogen of Lyme disease.



Leptospira, a spirochete (colorized TEM)Gram-Positive BacteriaAll gram-positive bacteria cluster in this clade, but the group also includes some closely related gram-negative species. This branch of bacteria rivals the proteobacteria in diversity.One gram-positive subgroup, the actinomycetes, forms colonies with branched chains of cells (the mycetes part of the name means "fungus," for which these bacteria were once mistaken). Two actinomycetes of medical importance are the species that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. But most actinomycetes are free-living species that help decompose the organic litter in soil; their secretions are partly responsible for the "earthy" odor of rich soil. Soil-dwelling species of the genus Streptomyces are cultured by pharmaceutical companies as a source of many antibiotics, including streptomycin.In addition to the colonial actinomycetes, the gram-positive group also includes a diversity of solitary species. There are spore formers such as Bacillus and Clostridium. Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis (see FIGURE 27.10). Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin that causes the potentially fatal disease botulism. The various species of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are also gram-positive bacteria.The most structurally unusual members of the gram-positive clade are the mycoplasmas, which are the only bacteria lacking cell walls and which are the smallest of all known cells, with diameters as tiny as 0.1 &uuml;m, only about five times the diameter of a ribosome. Many mycoplasmas are soil bacteria, but there are also pathogens, including a species that causes "walking pneumonia" in humans.

Hundreds of mycoplasmas cover this human fibroblast cell (colorized SEM)CyanobacteriaThese photoautotrophs are the only prokaryotes with plantlike, oxygenic photosynthesis. (In fact, chloroplasts evolved from a cyanobacterium that lived as an endosymbiont within a larger host cell; see Chapter 28). Both solitary and colonial cyanobacteria are abundant wherever there is water, providing an enormous amount of food for freshwater and marine ecosystems. Some filamentous colonies have cells specialized for nitrogen fixation, the metabolic process that converts atmospheric N2 to compounds that can be incorporated into proteins and other organic molecules (see FIGURE 27.11).

 Prokaryotes are indispensable links in the recycling of chemical elements in ecosystems

Not too long ago, in geologic terms, the atoms of the organic molecules in our bodies were parts of the inorganic compounds of soil, air, and water, as they will be again. Ongoing life depends on the recycling of chemical elements between the biological and physical components of ecosystems. Prokaryotes play essential roles in these chemical cycles (to be discussed in detail in Chapter 54). If it were not for such decomposers, carbon, nitrogen, and other elements essential to life would become locked in the organic molecules of corpses and waste products.

Prokaryotes also mediate the return of elements from the nonliving components of the environment (air, inorganic soil, and water) to the pool of organic compounds. Autotrophic prokaryotes make organic compounds from CO2, supporting food chains through which organic nutrients pass from the prokaryotes to prokaryote eaters, then on to secondary consumers.

Because of their many unique metabolic capabilities, prokaryotes are the only organisms able to metabolize inorganic molecules containing elements such as iron, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Cyanobacteria not only synthesize food and restore oxygen to the atmosphere, but also fix nitrogen, stocking the soil and water with nitrogenous compounds that other organisms can use to make proteins. And when plants and the animals that eat them die, soil prokaryotes return the nitrogen to the atmosphere. All life on Earth depends on prokaryotes and their unparalleled metabolic diversity.





 Many prokaryotes are symbiotic

Prokaryotes rarely function singly in the environment. More often they interact in groups, which often include other species of prokaryotes or eukaryotes with complementary metabolisms.

Symbiosis (from the Greek word for "living together") is the term used to describe ecological relationships between organisms of different species that are in direct contact. If one of the symbiotic organisms is much larger than the other, the larger is called the host. There are three categories of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. In mutualism, both symbiotic organisms benefit (FIGURE 27.15). In commensalism, one organism receives benefits while neither harming nor helping the other in any significant way. In parasitism, one symbiotic organism, called a parasite in this case, benefits at the expense of the host.

Fig 27-15. Mutualism: bacterial "headlights." The lighted oval under the eye of this deep-sea fish is an organ harboring symbiotic bacteria that are bioluminescent. A chemical reaction powered by ATP emits the light. The fish uses its headlamps to lure light-seeking prey and to signal potential mates.

Prokaryotes are represented in all three categories of symbiosis with eukaryotes. For example, plants of the legume family (peas, beans, alfalfa, and others) have lumps on their roots called nodules, which are home to mutualistic prokaryotes that fix nitrogen used by the host (see Rhizobium in TABLE 27.3). The plant reciprocates by providing the pro karyotes with a steady supply of sugar and other organic nutrients. Bacteria inhabiting the inner and outer surfaces of the human body consist mostly of commensal species, but some species are mutualistic symbionts. For instance, fermenting bacteria living in the vagina produce acids that maintain a pH between 4.0 and 4.5, suppressing the growth of yeast and other potentially harmful microorganisms. Among parasitic bacteria are those classified as pathogens because they cause disease in their hosts.





 Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases

Most of us are well most of the time because our defenses check the growth of pathogens to which we are exposed. Occasionally, the balance shifts in favor of a pathogen, and we become ill. To be pathogenic, a parasite must invade the host, resist internal defenses long enough to begin growing, then harm the host in some way. Pathogenic prokaryotes cause about half of all human diseases (FIGURE 27.16).

Fig 27-16. A very harmful "germ." The yellow rods are Haemophilus influenzae bacteria on skin cells lining the interior of a human nose (colorized SEM). These pathogens are transmitted through the air. H. influenzae, not to be confused with influenza (flu) viruses, causes pneumonia and other lung infections that kill about 4 million people worldwide per year. Most victims are children in developing countries, where malnutrition lowers resistance to all pathogens.

Some pathogens are opportunistic, meaning they are normal residents of a host but can cause illness when the host's defenses are weakened by such factors as poor nutrition or a recent bout with the flu. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae (a gram-positive bacter ium) lives in the throats of most healthy people, but this opportunist can multiply and cause pneumonia when the host's defenses are down.

Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and other scientists began linking disease to pathogenic microbes in the late 1800s. The first to actually connect certain diseases to specific bacteria was Robert Koch, a German physician who identified the bacteria responsible for anthrax and tuberculosis. His methods established four criteria, now called Koch's postulates, that are still the guidelines for medical microbiology. To establish that a specific pathogen is the cause of a disease, the researcher must (1) find the same pathogen in each diseased individual investigated, (2) isolate the pathogen from a diseased subject and grow the microbe in a pure culture, (3) induce the disease in experimental animals by transferring the pathogen from the culture, and (4) isolate the same pathogen from the experimental animals after the disease develops. The postulates work for most pathogens, but exceptions do occur. For example, no one has yet cultured the spirochete Treponema pallidum on artificial media, but circumstantial evidence leaves no doubt that this organism causes syphilis.

How do pathogenic prokaryotes produce symptoms of disease? Some species, such as the gram-positive actinomycete that causes tuberculosis, disrupt the health of the host by invading tissues. More commonly, pathogens cause illness by producing poisons called exotoxins and endotoxins.

Exotoxins are proteins secreted by prokaryotes. Exotoxins can produce disease symptoms even without the prokaryotes being present. For example, when the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum (see TABLE 27.3) grows anaerobically in improperly canned foods, one of the by-products of its fermentation is an exotoxin that causes the potentially fatal disease botulism. Some exotoxins are among the most potent poisons known; just 1 g of botulism toxin would be sufficient to kill a million people. Another exotoxin-producing species is the enteric proteobacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, a dangerous disease characterized by severe diarrhea. Resulting from the consumption of water contaminated with human feces, cholera is often epidemic during wars and famines. Even E. coli can be an exotoxin-releasing culprit. Some cases of traveler's diarrhea result from toxins released by strains of E. coli obtained from another person via contaminated food or water.

In contrast to exotoxins, endotoxins are components of the outer membranes of certain gram-negative bacteria. Examples of endotoxin-producing bacteria include nearly all members of the genus Salmonella, which are not normally present in healthy animals. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever, and several other species of Salmonella, some of which are commonly found in poultry, cause food poisoning.

Since the discovery in the 19th century that "germs" cause disease, improved sanitation has significantly reduced infant mortality and extended life expectancy in developed countries. Antibiotics have also saved many lives and reduced disease incidence. More than half of our antibiotics (including streptomycin, neomycin, erythromycin, aureomycin, and tetracycline) come from soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces (an actinomycete; see TABLE 27.3). In nature, these compounds prevent encroachment by competing microbes.

Bacterial diseases are a continuing threat. Their general decline over the past century is probably due more to public health policies and education than to "wonder drugs." A case in point is Lyme disease, currently the most widespread pest-carried disease in the United States. The disease is caused by a spirochete bacterium carried by ticks that live on deer and field mice (FIGURE 27.17). Lyme disease usually starts as a red rash shaped like a bull's-eye around a tick bite. Antibiotics can cure the disease if administered within about a month after exposure. If untreated, Lyme disease can cause debilitating arthritis, heart disease, and nervous disorders. A vaccine is now available, but it does not give full protection. The best defense is public education about avoiding tick bites and seeking treatment if a rash develops. When walking through brush, it is advisable to use insect repellent and wear light-colored clothing to reduce contact with ticks.

Today, the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria is a serious health threat aggravated by imprudent and excessive antibiotic use.

Although declared illegal by the United Nations, the selective culturing and stockpiling of deadly bacterial disease agents for use as biological weapons remains a threat to world peace.





 Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology

Humans have learned many ways of exploiting the diverse metabolic capabilities of prokaryotes, both for scientific research and for practical purposes. Much of what we know about metabolism and molecular biology has been learned in laboratories using prokaryotes as relatively simple model systems. In fact, E. coli, the prokaryotic "white rat" of so many research labs, is the best understood of all organisms. And we are just beginning to explore the great potential prokaryotes have for helping us solve some of our environmental problems.

The use of organisms to remove pollutants from water, air, and soil is called bioremediation. The most familiar example of bioremediation is the use of prokaryotic decomposers to treat our sewage. Raw sewage is first passed through a series of screens and shredders, and solid matter is allowed to settle out from the liquid waste. This solid matter, called sludge, is then gradually added to a culture of anaerobic prokaryotes, including both bacteria and archaea. The microbes decompose the organic matter in the sludge, converting it to material that can be used as landfill or fertilizer after chemical sterilization. Liquid wastes are treated separately from the sludge (FIGURE 27.18). In other examples of bioremediation, soil bacteria called pseudomonads (proteobacteria) are used to decompose petroleum compounds on beaches and other sites of oil spills and to decompose a variety of synthetic compounds, such as pesticides (FIGURE 27.19). Genetic engineers are improving the bioremediation powers of certain prokaryotes.

Fig 27-18. Putting prokaryotes to work in sewage treatment facilities. This is a trickling filter system, one type of mechanism for treating liquid wastes after sludge is removed. The long horizontal pipes rotate slowly, spraying liquid wastes through the air onto a thick bed of rocks. Bacteria and fungi growing on the rocks remove much of the organic material dissolved in the waste. Outflow from the rock bed is sterilized and then released, usually into a river or ocean.

Fig 27-19. Bioremediation for an oil spill. A worker is spraying fertilizers on an oil-soaked beach in Alaska. The fertilizers stimulate growth of indigenous bacteria that can initiate the breakdown of the oil--in some cases, speeding the natural process of breakdown some fivefold. This technique is the fastest and least expensive way yet devised to clean up oil spills on beaches.

Humans also put bacteria to work as metabolic "factories" for commercial products. The chemical industry grows immense cultures of bacteria that produce acetone, butanol, and several other products. Pharmaceutical companies culture bacteria that make vitamins and antibiotics. Bacteria containing magnetic particles may soon become a commercial source for manufacturing magnetic tapes and other recording devices. The food industry uses bacteria to convert milk to yogurt and various kinds of cheese. And DNA technology has opened a new era in the commercial use of prokaryotes (see Chapter 20).

In this chapter, we have surveyed the prokaryotes and traced their history. On an ancient Earth inhabited only by prokaryotes, all the diverse forms of nutrition and metabolism evolved. Most subsequent evolutionary breakthroughs were structural rather than metabolic. The most significant development was the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic ancestors, which we will explore in the next chapter.
