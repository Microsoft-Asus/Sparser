Your own nervous system, made of living neurons, is using processes vastly more complex than those of a computer as you read and comprehend these words. Indeed, the human nervous system is probably the most intricately organized aggregate of matter on Earth. A single cubic centimeter of the human brain may contain well over 50 million nerve cells, each of which may communicate with thousands of other neurons in information-processing networks that make the most elaborate computer look primitive. These neural pathways control our every feeling, perception, and movement and enable us to learn, remember, think, and be conscious of ourselves and our surroundings</span>.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">The nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system often cooperate and interact in regulating internal body functions and behavior (see Chapters 43 and 45). In the maintenance of homeostasis, certain parts of the brain receive and process data about the body’s internal environment and correct imbalances by sending out commands to other organs. Neural and endocrine pathways can also collaborate during responses to stress--enhancing or suppressing immune function, for example</span>.</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Despite their structural and functional linkage, the nervous system and endocrine system play somewhat different roles in body coordination. With its incomparable structural complexity, the nervous system can integrate vast amounts of information, such as that required for human thought and speech. Timing can also be a key difference. The endocrine system may take minutes, hours, or even days to act, partly because of the time it takes for hormones to be made and carried in the blood to their target organs. In contrast, the nervous system is a signaling network with branches carrying information directly to and from specific sites. Neurons are specialized for the fast transmission of impulses--as quickly as 150 m/sec (over 330 mph). In humans, information can travel from the brain to the hands (or vice versa) in a few milliseconds</span>.</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Animal survival and reproduction depends on rapid and flexible responses to changes in the environment, and a diversity of nervous systems has evolved in various animal phyla. This chapter discusses the form and function of these nervous systems. As we have seen in many other organ systems, animal nervous systems are remarkably similar at the</span> cellular <span class="Emphasis1">level--in how neurons work, for example--but differ at higher levels of organization, such as the structure and function of their brains</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
