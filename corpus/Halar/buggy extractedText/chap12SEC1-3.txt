REGULATION OF THE CELL CYCLE

 

 A molecular control system drives the cell cycle



 

 Internal and external cues help regulate the cell cycle



 

 Cancer cells have escaped from cell cycle controls



The timing and rate of cell division in different parts of a plant or animal are crucial to normal growth, development, and maintenance. The frequency of cell division varies with the type of cell. For example, human skin cells divide frequently throughout life, whereas liver cells maintain the ability to divide but keep it in reserve until an appropriate need arises--say, to repair a wound. Some of the most specialized cells, such as mature nerve cells and muscle cells, do not divide at all in a mature human. These cell cycle differences result from regulation at the molecular level. The mechanisms of this regulation are of intense interest, not only for understanding the life cycles of normal cells but also for understanding how cancer cells manage to escape normal controls.
