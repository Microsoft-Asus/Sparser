ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Most U.S. Embassy personnel were leaving Pakistan and other Americans were urged to join them Monday after a suspect in the East African embassy bombings was caught in Pakistan and turned over to Kenyan authorities</ENAMEX> .
U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of the total contingent of about 120 in the embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Karachi , Lahore and Peshawar would leave under security orders from the State Department .
They , their families and the families of essential staff will begin leaving Tuesday , he said .
`` American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged ... to consider seriously departing Pakistan , '' the embassy added in a statement .
It noted airports were open and commercial flights available , but added the embassy was arranging additional flights .
About 6,700 Americans live in Pakistan , according to embassy figures .
The heightened security warning was valid for a month , and could be renewed .
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Simons said there had been no specific threat against U.S. citizens in Pakistan .
The evacuation `` has to do with a range of perceived threats , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Embassy staff were considered most at risk given the nearly simultaneous explosions in Nairobi , Kenya and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed a total of 257 people</ENAMEX> .
Simons said the evacuation was not linked to the transfer Pakistani officials reported Sunday of a suspect in the embassy bombings .
In a brief statement Sunday , Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said a man who arrived at the Karachi airport from Nairobi on the day of the bombings attracted the attention of immigration officials because he did not match the photograph on his Yemeni passport .
Altaf said <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">he was interrogated by Pakistani officials who determined he had some link to the African bombings and handed him over to Kenyan authorities</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Kenya 's Criminal Investigations Division confirmed Monday they were questioning the suspect , identified as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The FBI and CID said Odeh had two aliases : Abdull Bast Awadh and Mohammad Sadiq Howaida</ENAMEX> .
Also Monday , <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">a Pakistani border official said a Saudi and a Sudanese were stopped at the Afghan border Saturday when immigration officials discovered they had no identity papers .
Bakhtiar Khan , chief of the Pakistani border post near the northern city of Peshawar , said a team of army and civilian investigators were interrogating the two to determine if they had any links to the African bombings</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The News , a national Pakistani newspaper , quoted unnamed government sources Monday as saying Odeh claimed the attack was sponsored by Osama bin Laden , a Saudi living in neighboring Afghanistan whom U.S. officials have identified as a possible suspect in the bombings</ENAMEX> .
Bin Laden has been vocal in his hatred of what he sees as U.S. imperialism and has pledged to drive U.S. troops out of bases in places like his native Saudi Arabia .
A spokesman for Afghanistan 's Taliban militia told The Associated Press Monday that bin Laden , who has pledged not to engage in such activities while living under Taliban protection had nothing to do with the bombings .
The Pakistani government had tried to conceal U.S. involvement in Odeh 's transfer to Kenya , perhaps because of the case of Mir Aimal Kasi , the Pakistani convicted of killing two CIA employees during a shooting spree in Virginia in 1993 .
When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint FBI - Pakistani operation , angry Pakistanis accused their government of groveling before U.S. power .
Americans in Pakistan have been advised to be on the alert since last November , when four American oil workers were gunned down in the southern port city of Karachi following Kasi 's conviction .
In March , cement barricades were erected on the roads leading to the high-walled U.S. Embassy compound in Islamabad .
