ON THE CHECHNYA - INGUSHETIA BORDER --
Like a recurring nightmare , life for the last two weeks has been horrifyingly familiar for Tamara Akimarova and her family , refugees forced to flee their home in the breakaway republic of Chechnya .
They survived the war from 1994-96 only to be uprooted again two weeks ago after Russian planes strafed their neighborhood in the city of Urus - Martan .
The school where Akimarova , 42 , teaches was destroyed by a Russian bomb , she said .
Thirteen family members have been on the run from the war ever since , living out of a dilapidated Soviet -made microbus .
The oldest is Akimarova 's 87-year -old grandmother and the youngest is her 7-year -old son .
They have settled in a refugee camp just inside Chechnya , near the border with the neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia .
There , the van rests in the grassy field next to a row of tents .
With relief supplies desperately low , there were no more tents to be had for Akimarova and her family , so they sleep in the open , with blankets they salvaged from home .
Supper is a meager assortment of sliced cucumbers , potatoes and bread .
`` Why are we to blame for it ?
The Russians have bad people .
We have bad people .
But why are we punished ? '' she asked , tears welling in her dark eyes .
The innocent refugees streaming out of Chechnya say they are trapped between Moscow 's imperial fury toward the southern republic and ruthless Chechen warlords who will stop at nothing short of an independent Islamic state .
This sequel to the war in Chechnya could have been avoided , they say , if only both sides would talk .
This reprise will be as bloody and senseless as the first one , they say .
The Russian offensive began last month after a series of terror attacks on apartment buildings in Moscow and other cities killed nearly 300 people .
Russian officials have blamed Chechnya for supporting terrorists and allowing Islamic guerrillas in August to invade neighboring Dagestan , a southern republic under Russia 's control .
By last week , Russian ground forces -- 50,000 strong along the border with Chechnya -- had taken control of the northern third of Chechnya , to a line roughly following the Terek River .
A report in the newspaper Izvestia said that Russian generals had drawn up plans for an invasion of the capital , Grozny , where Russian troops and Chechen rebels engaged in fierce street-to-street fighting in the earlier war .
Tens of thousands of people died in the 1994-96 war , mainly civilians caught in saturation bombing by Russian planes and artillery .
Unlike NATO , Russia 's poorly financed military does not possess a significant arsenal of `` smart '' weapons designed to precisely target and thus reduce the chances for error .
In Moscow last week , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signaled that the current operation to carve out a security zone in Chechnya could become a longer campaign .
Putin said the army 's aim would be `` the total destruction of terrorism . ''
Russian officials insist that their planes and artillery are targeting only sites that could be useful to the separatist guerrillas of Chechnya .
But eyewitness accounts of refugees tell a different story .
While casualty figures are impossible to determine independently , it appears that civilians are suffering greatly .
Zura Tutayeva , 45 , piled her family along with four others into an old bus and fled the capital Grozny last week after they said Russian jets bombed five houses and a mosque in their neighborhood .
Five civilians were killed , she said , and no fighters .
`` We took our kids out of school and do n't know where we 're going , '' she said as they crossed into Ingushetia .
`` We do n't know where we 'll live or who will help us . ''
A videotape obtained last week by Reuters Television appeared to support the claims of Chechen officials that Russian forces bombed a road in northern Chechnya and hit a bus full of refugees , killing 41 .
Russian authorities have denied any knowledge or responsibility for the attack .
A rebel spokesman also said Friday that Russian planes had bombed the village of Elistanzhe in southeast Chechnya , near the border with Dagestan , on Thursday and that 32 people died .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The president of Ingushetia , where most of the nearly 150,000 refugees leaving Chechnya have fled , warned Friday that the region was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe .
`` The republic is simply suffocating , '' Ruslan Aushev , the Ingush president told the Interfax news agency .
`` We have an acute shortage of food , baby food , warm clothes , blankets , and even more important -- tents , trailers and stoves .
If the situation does not change , people will have to spend the winter out in the open , '' he said</ENAMEX> .
While insurrectionist guerrillas won the war in 1996 , forcing Russia into a humiliating withdrawal of its troops , there is not widespread support for the ruling warlords .
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov , who won election in 1997 in what international monitors regarded as a relatively fair ballot , has been unable to halt the lawlessness and turmoil in Chechnya by competing bands of guerrillas and criminal gangs .
Many refugees blame guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev , a veteran of the 1994-96 war , for provoking this fight by crossing into neighboring Dagestan with a band of fighters in August to foment an Islamic -inspired rebellion there .
But the harshness of the Russian response serves only to rally support for him and other warlords , said many refugees .
`` Only one percent of the people support Basayev and the guerrillas .
But when Russia is making war on us , everyone supports Basayev , '' said a driver named Abdullah , 35 , from the city of Urus - Martan .
He was afraid to reveal his last name .
Maskhadov has long sought to open talks with the Kremlin .
Yet while Russia signed a peace accord with Maskhadov and Chechnya claimed independence when Russian troops withdrew , Moscow has maintained that the republic remains part of the Russian Federation .
Late last month , Putin declared Maskhadov 's government to be illegitimate and endorsed a Chechen parliament in exile in Moscow , leading to speculation that if its military campaign succeeds , Russia will try to install a puppet government in Chechnya .
Ultimately , Russian 's actions to resolve the Chechnya problem will hurt more than help , analysts warn .
Occupying one third of Chechnya may make Russia more secure in the short term , but be more deadly for Russian troops in the long run _and make a full-scale invasion more likely .
`` The defense perimeter -LRB- for Russia -RRB- may be 20 percent shorter , but Russia 's enemies in the region have now increased tenfold , '' said Pavel Felgenhauer , an independent defense analyst in Moscow .
`` The quagmire the Russian government said it wants to avoid seems all set , '' he added .
