CHIRI - YURT , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russian paratroopers and riot police clashed with scattered rebels in southern Chechnya on Saturday , but major fighting has quieted down while the militants regroup , a top Russian commander said .
`` There is no open war today .
The militants are scattered , '' Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev told reporters in the Chechen city of Gudermes .
Russian troops who entered Chechnya in September took about two-thirds of the republic in the first months of the war .
But they have stalled in trying to oust the rebels from the Vedeno region in the mountainous south .
The militants have scaled back operations in the past two days to redistribute their forces , the military command said Saturday .
Chechen field commanders are working to organize small militant groups into bigger units , the military said , according to the Interfax news service .
Still , scattered clashes have continued and Russian warplanes have flown 20 combat missions since Friday while continuing artillery strikes .
Rebels with grenade launchers attacked a Russian checkpoint in the town of Shali , drawing Russian fire , Interior Ministry spokesman Mikhail Solomatin said Saturday , according to Interfax .
Federal troops have regrouped in the Vedeno and Shatoi gorges and are conducting `` special operations , '' said Troshev , the Russian commander .
Riot police units and paratroopers are also in action there , he said .
Meanwhile , controversial pro- Moscow Chechen leader Bislan Gantamirov was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Russian army in a ceremony in Gudermes on Saturday .
The Defense Ministry gave no reason for the unusual move , which came just days after Gantamirov quit as the head of a Kremlin -backed Chechen militia , saying his force had been sidelined by Russian police .
The Defense Ministry insisted Saturday that Gantamirov remained chief of the Chechen militia .
Gantamirov was convicted of embezzling funds meant for rebuilding Chechnya after the 1994-6 war , then was pardoned and tapped by the Kremlin last year to lead a pro- Russian police force .
Another pro- Moscow Chechen leader , Malik Saidullayev , held a rally in the southern mountain village of Chiri - Yurt on Saturday to urge Chechens to oppose the rebels .
He distributed 60 tons of flour and meat to the remote village .

EU envoy to Russia Gilbert Dubois , Portuguese Ambassador Pacheco Luiz - Gomes and French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere also met with Ingush President Ruslan Aushev</ENAMEX> .
Moscow has come under international criticism for the war .
Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya after an invasion of neighboring Dagestan by Chechnya -based militants .
