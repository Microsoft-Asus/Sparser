Some of these compounds are very large and are called macromolecules. Most macromolecules are polymers, chains of identical or similar building blocks called monomers. Monomers form larger molecules by condensation reactions in which water molecules are released (dehydration). Polymers can disassemble by the reverse process, hydrolysis.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 5A: <span class="Emphasis1">

Secondary structure is the folding or coiling of the polypeptide into repeating configurations, mainly the <span class="symbol">a</span> helix and the <span class="symbol">b</span> pleated sheet, which result from hydrogen bonding between parts of the polypeptide backbone. Tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of a polypeptide and results from interactions between amino acid side chains. Proteins made of more than one polypeptide chain (subunits) have a quaternary level of structure. The structure and function of a protein are sensitive to physical and chemical conditions. Protein shape is ultimately determined by its primary structure, but in the cell, proteins called chaperonins may help the folding process.</p><a name="para30"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity5E:<span class="Emphasis1">
