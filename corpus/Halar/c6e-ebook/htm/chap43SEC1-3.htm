Around the end of the nineteenth century, researchers performed an experiment in which they transferred such fluids from animals that had recovered from an infection to others that had not been exposed to it. For a short time the latter animals were protected from the infection. The investigators had transferred humoral immunity (antibodies) from animal to animal. They also found that immunity to some infections could be passed along only if cells, later identified as T lymphocytes, were transferred. This second type of immunity, which depends on the action of T cells, became known as <span class="Emphasis2">cell-mediated immunity.</span></p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The circulating antibodies of the humoral response defend mainly against free bacteria, toxins, and viruses present in body fluids. In contrast, the T cells of the cell-mediated response are active against viruses and bacteria within infected body cells and against fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Cell-mediated immunity is crucial in the body's response against transplanted tissue and cancer cells, both of which are perceived as "nonself."<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.10</span> provides an overview of the humoral and cell-mediated responses, the two branches of the immune system, which we will explore shortly. In addition to introducing these two branches, the figure shows the connections linking them--cell-signaling interactions among the lymphocytes. Central to this network of cell-signaling is the helper T cell, which responds to antigen presented by a macrophage and stimulates both B cells and other T cells.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig43-10','../fig/big/fig43-10.jpg','fig43-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig43-10.jpg" alt="fig43-10" name="myfig43-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 43-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">An overview of the immune responses.</span> In this simplified flowchart, green arrows track the primary response, and blue arrows track the secondary response.
