-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod , charterboat captain Cookie Murray glances aft , eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake .
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming underneath the boat .
Finally , at 2 : 45 p.m. , a line on one of the baited poles at the stern pops .
Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting chair .
This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season , and the right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo .
The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds , cranking countless circles with his right hand , bracing the pole with his left .
The struggle seems impossible , endless .
Yet it is repeated thousands of times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States coasts .
The only thing unusual is that a biologist , Molly Lutcavage , an athletic woman in her early 40s , is on board .
While Petronio fights with his catch , Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart to the end of a hammer .
The bluefin begins to tire , floating toward the surface .
The fish is beautiful , with opalescent skin .
It is also gargantuan : 7.5 feet long and 400 pounds .
First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing fish over to the side of the hull .
Second mate Delmer Bacelis swings the hammer and -- bang ! -- implants the dart behind the rear dorsal fin of the bluefin .
Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back .
The bluefin rights and swims away .
The dart it carries is a transmitter designed to record the tuna 's journey for the next six or seven months .
Despite the great value of bluefin , biologists know little about them .
Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters .
A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour ; rushing through the sea it can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time .
With a life expectancy of more than 30 years , the fish can grow to well over 10 feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds .
Nevertheless , size and speed have proved to be little protection .
As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s , the price for bluefin tuna skyrocketed .
Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed with quotas , basing policies on the belief that there are two distinct stocks of tuna : a western stock spawned in the Gulf of Mexico , migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters , and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea , migrating along the European coast to northern waters .
In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the Mediterranean that the quota was broken , with the catch reaching an estimated 46,000 tons .
If the stocks are distinct , the fortunes of one should n't mean much to the other .
But if that assumption is wrong , overfishing in part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean .
To know more , scientists developed an advanced tag to put on bluefins .
They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters in waterproof containers that float free from the fish .
At a programmed time , they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting data .
Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag on a bluefin .
In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine .
At the time , there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half .
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered , while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers of bluefin .
Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape Cod .
In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day -- equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock .
The following year , a pilot photographed a single school of about 4,500 fish .
Lutcavage 's survey helped to forestall a quota cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of Sciences .
The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the western Atlantic had been stable since 1988 .
Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997 .
She also tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and rejoin their schools .
In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags weighing less than an ounce .
Light tags do n't slow tuna down , and they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep dive .
But the data they transmit are limited .
Once on a bluefin , the tag starts logging the temperature once an hour .
At the end of eachday the tag 's computer averages the temperatures and stores the figure .
After 60 days of taking temperatures , the computer shuts down and the tag floats free .
The data -- when the tag surfaced , its location and the average daily temperatures -- are transmitted to a weather satellite that passes overhead every 102 minutes .
Eventually , the data move as e-mail to a scientist .
The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a single tag takes two to three weeks .
Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July last year , the spawning season for tuna .
The data suggest that bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a couple of weeks , probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the cooler mid- Atlantic .
By the time spawning season came , the fish were all in a region of the mid- Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores on the east .
None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning grounds during spawning time .
Barbara Block of Stanford , working off Cape Hatteras , N.C. , has started to work with an archival tag .
Lodged in a fish 's abdomen , the tag measures not just water temperature , but also light , depth and internal temperature .
Two years into the archival program , the evidence shows that bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the afternoon , that they spend most of their time in the upper water layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet .
The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid- Atlantic and not crossing .
Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern waters , but it 's not clear if many actually make the trip .
But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season .
Now comes the wait .
A tag must surface , a satellite must pass by , a signal must be sent .
Out there the true story of one of the ocean 's giants remains to be told .
