For example, skin transplanted from one person to a nonidentical person will look healthy for a day or two, but it will then be destroyed by immune responses. Interestingly, however, a pregnant woman does not reject the fetus as a foreign body. Apparently, the structure of the placenta is the key to this acceptance (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.17</span>).</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">In this section you will learn about the potential problems associated with blood transfusions and tissue transplants. Keep in mind that the body's hostile reaction to an incompatible transfusion or transplant is not a disorder of the immune system, but a normal reaction of a healthy immune system exposed to foreign antigens.</p><p class="Header3">Blood Groups and Blood Transfusion</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The genetic basis for the <span class="Emphasis2">ABO blood groups</span> was discussed in Chapter 14. An individual with type A blood has A antigens on the surface of his or her red blood cells. The A molecule is referred to as an antigen because it may be identified as foreign if placed in the body of another person; the A antigen is not antigenic to its "owner." Similarly, B antigens are found on type B red blood cells, A and B antigens are found on type AB red blood cells, and neither antigen is found on type O red blood cells.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">An individual with type A blood will not, of course, produce antibodies to A antigens. However, a person with type A blood has antibodies to the B antigen, even if the person has never been exposed to type B blood. You may find it odd that antibodies to foreign blood group antigens exist in the body even in the absence of an incompatible blood transfusion. These antibodies arise in response to bacteria (normal flora) that have epitopes very similar to blood group antigens. Thus an individual with type A blood does not make antibodies to A-like bacterial epitopes--the immune system considers these as self--but that person does make antibodies to B-like bacterial epitopes. Therefore, if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, the preexisting anti-B antibodies will induce an immediate and devastating transfusion reaction. The ABO blood types and corresponding antibodies are summarized in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 14.10</span>.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Because blood group antigens are polysaccharides, they induce T-independent responses, which elicit no memory cells. As a result, each response is like a primary response, and it generates IgM anti-blood-group antibodies, not IgG. This is fortunate; because IgM does not cross the placenta, no harm comes to a developing fetus with a blood type different from its mother's. However, another red blood cell antigen, the <span class="Emphasis2">Rh factor,</span> is able to cause trouble because antibodies produced to it are of the IgG class. A potentially dangerous situation can arise when a mother is Rh-negative (lacks the Rh factor) but has a fetus that is Rh-positive, having inherited the factor from the father. If small amounts of fetal blood cross the placenta, as may happen late in pregnancy or during delivery of the baby, the mother mounts a T-dependent humoral response against the Rh factor. The danger occurs in subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies, when the mother's Rh-specific memory B cells are exposed to the Rh factor. These B cells produce IgG antibodies, which can cross the placenta and destroy the red cells of the fetus. To prevent this, the mother is injected with anti-Rh antibodies after delivering her first Rh-positive baby. She is, in effect, passively immunized (artificially) to eliminate the Rh antigen before her own immune system responds and generates immunological memory against the Rh factor, endangering her future Rh-positive babies.</p><p class="Header3">Tissue Grafts and Organ Transplantation</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes the protein fingerprint unique to each individual, is responsible for stimulating the rejection of tissue grafts and organ transplants. Foreign MHC molecules are antigenic, inducing immune responses against the donated tissue or organ. To minimize rejection, attempts are made to match the MHC of the tissue donor and recipient as closely as possible. In the absence of an identical twin, siblings usually provide the closest tissue-type match. In addition to a close match, various medicines are necessary to suppress the immune response to the transplant. However, this strategy leaves the recipient more susceptible to infection and cancer during the course of treatment. More selective drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506, which suppress helper T cell activation without crippling nonspecific defense or T-independent humoral responses, have greatly improved the success of organ transplants.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">In one type of life-giving transplant, that of bone marrow, the graft itself, rather than the host, is the source of potential immune rejection. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia and other cancers, as well as various hematological (blood cell) diseases. As in any transplant, the MHC of donor and recipient are matched as closely as possible. Prior to transplant, the recipient is typically treated with irradiation to eliminate his or her own bone marrow cells, including any abnormal cells. This treatment effectively obliterates the recipient's immune system, leaving little chance of graft rejection. However, the great danger in bone marrow transplants is that the donated marrow, containing lymphocytes, will react against the recipient. This <span class="Emphasis2">graft versus host reaction</span> is limited if the MHC molecules of the donor and recipient are well matched. Bone marrow donor programs around the world continually seek volunteers; because of the great variability of the MHC, a diverse pool of potential donors is essential.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
