Less than a month after conception, our brains were taking form and our developing hearts had already begun to pulsate (see photograph).

Chapter 21 described some of the recent research, introducing you to a number of basic genetic and cellular mechanisms involved in development. The animals discussed there were mainly invertebrates. In this chapter we concentrate mainly on the embryonic development of animals with backbones</span>.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Molecular biologist Sidney Brenner has wryly commented that developmental biology is about "how to make a mouse," and indeed, mice are favorite experimental models of researchers studying vertebrate development, in particular the development of mammals. Frogs and chickens are also important model organisms for understanding vertebrate development. From the study of these animals and of certain invertebrates (including the ones you met in Chapter 21), scientists have worked out both the stages of embryonic development and many of the cellular and molecular events that underlie them</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
