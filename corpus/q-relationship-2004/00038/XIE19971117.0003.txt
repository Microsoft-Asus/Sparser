They will explain the situation of the South Korean automobile market while backing their government 's measures for a gradual opening of the market , the KAMA official said .
The KAMA is planning a liaison office in the U.S. capital city to better cooperate with the U.S. auto industry and communicate with U.S. politicians and industrialists .
Early last month , Washington threatened to impose the so-called Super 301 section of the U.S. trade law against alleged South Korean restrictions on foreign cars .
The USTR said South Korea had not relaxed restrictions on foreign entry into its auto market .
The South Korean government reacted by declaring that it would bring the case to the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- for review .
The South Korean auto industry was concerned that the dispute could lead to a significant drop in its car exports to the United States , which stood at about 200,000 last year .
