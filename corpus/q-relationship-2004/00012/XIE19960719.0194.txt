WASHINGTON , July 18 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Following the Trans World Airlines -LRB- TWA -RRB- Boeing 747 crash on Wednesday near New York City , security has been tightened in places such as airports , especially that in Atlanta where the 26th Summer Olympics is opening Friday .
As officials declining to rule in or rule out terrorist bomb as a possible cause of the plane 's mid-air explosion that killed all the 230 people aboard , law enforcement , intelligence and airport officials have heightened alert .
As a terrorist task force investigates the possibility that the explosion was an act of terrorism , security officials were taking a hard look at measures in places prior to the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games .
Because of the June 23 truck bombing of a military base housing U.S. Air Force personnel at Dharan , Saudi Arabia , and similar bombings at the World Trade Center in New York and Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , it is understandable that no one wants to leave anything to chance .
In Atlanta , security restrictions were already in places including invasion barriers surrounding the outside of the airport , windows coated with anti-ballistic film to prevent them from being shattered by gunfire and a noticeably increased police presence in the city .
Airport officials said that more tightening of security is possible .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">As there were high speculations of terrorist bomb , President Bill Clinton warned Americans today against jumping to conclusions about what might have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800 .</ENAMEX>
He referred to the apparently incorrect early speculation that the April 19 , 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City might have been the work of foreign terrorists .
However , there have been signs of increasing anti-terrorism measures in the country in recent days .
On Monday , Clinton has reportedly ordered steps to safeguard telecommunications , electrical power grids , gas and oil storage and transportation as well as infrastructure related to banking and finance , transportation , water supply , emergency services and government operations .
He also ordered the creation of an inter-agency task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and including Pentagon officials to cope with any such attacks .
The General Services Administration , which handles federal office space , is moving to take away about 360-meter street parking spaces around 19 high-profile buildings in the Washington area to protect them from car bombs .
