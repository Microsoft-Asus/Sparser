									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">Health officials worldwide are concerned by a resurgence of diseases caused by bacteria that are resistant to standard antibiotics. For instance, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are now causing an epidemic of tuberculosis (TB), a lung disease spread by airborne droplets. Drugs can relieve TB symptoms in a few weeks, but it takes much longer to halt the infection, and patients are likely to discontinue treatment while bacteria are still present. Why can prokaryotes quickly reinfect a patient if they are not wiped out? How might this result in the evolution of drug-resistant pathogens?</p>

									<a name="para93"></a><p class="BlockText">You learned in this chapter that the former taxon "Monera" is undergoing modification, with at least 21 kingdoms erected in some schemes in addition to the super-kingdom level of the domain. Proponents of this new classification argue it better reflects evolutionary history, but why do you think this is desirable? Can you suggest some questions or hypotheses that can be framed with the new classification but could or would not even be asked with the former classification?</p>

Locate such a report and highlight the cases that are likely associated with potential food contamination by pathogenic prokaryotes.</p>
