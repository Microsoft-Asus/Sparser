DIVERSITY OF FUNGI

 

 Phylum Chytridiomycota: Chytrids may provide clues about fungal origins



 

 Phylum Zygomycota: Zygote fungi form resistant structures during sexual reproduction



 

 Phylum Ascomycota: Sac fungi produce sexual spores in saclike asci



 

 Phylum Basidiomycota: Club fungi have long-lived dikaryotic mycelia



 

 Molds, yeasts, lichens, and mycorrhizae are specialized lifestyles that evolved independently in diverse fungal phyla







More than 100,000 species of fungi are known, and mycologists (biologists who study fungi) estimate that there are actually about 1.5 million species worldwide. The taxonomic scheme used in this chapter classifies fungi into four phyla (FIGURE 31.4).

Fig 31-4. Phylogeny of fungi. This phylogenetic tree, supported primarily by molecular evidence, indicates probable evolutionary relationships among the four phyla of the kingdom Fungi. Representing the oldest lineage of fungi, the chytrids are mainly aquatic and have flagellated cells. Fungi in the other three phyla lack flagellated stages.
