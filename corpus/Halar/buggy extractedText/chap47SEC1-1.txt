THE STAGES OF EARLY EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT

 

 From egg to organism, an animal's form develops gradually: the concept of epigenesis



 

 Fertilization activates the egg and brings together the nuclei of sperm and egg



 

 Cleavage partitions the zygote into many smaller cells



 

 Gastrulation rearranges the blastula to form a three-layered embryo with a primitive gut



 

 In organogenesis, the organs of the animal body form from the three embryonic germ layers



 

 Amniote embryos develop in a fluid-filled sac within a shell or uterus
