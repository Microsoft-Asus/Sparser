COLOMBO , Sri Lanka
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
In a sharp change of tone , the commander of the Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka said Friday he is ready for peace talks to end the 15-year war , but would not give up the Tamil demand for `` our own soil . ''
`` We have not closed the door for peace .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">We are open to the civilized method of resolving conflict through rational dialogue , '' said Velupillai Prabhakaran , leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , in a statement faxed to news organizations .</ENAMEX>
Prabhakaran said he preferred third-party mediation , and would not accept conditions .
In the past , the government has demanded the Tigers relinquish some weapons before talks could begin .
`` We aspire to live in peace fully with freedom and dignity , without the interference of anyone , in our own soil in our motherland , where we were born and bred , '' he said .
`` We , too , are human beings . ''
The statement was to have been broadcast on the clandestine Voice of Tigers radio , but the signal was apparently jammed and could not be heard in government-held territory .
The moderate tone of what has become Prabhakaran 's annual address was markedly milder than last year , when he told his followers that liberation is not a gift , but is `` achieved by shedding blood and through hard struggle . ''
There was no immediate reaction from the government .
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has proposed constitutional changes to give more powers to local councils , including one governing a predominately Tamil area in Sri Lanka 's north and east .
But the rebels demand a separate homeland , accusing the Sinhalese majority of systematic oppression of the Tamils .
Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka 's 18.5 million people and have a language , religion and culture distinct from that of the Sinhalese .
The government has treated previous peaceful signals from the Tigers with skepticism since the rebels abruptly ended a three-month cease-fire and broke off peace talks in 1995 .
But analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu called the speech `` healthy and encouraging , '' and said the government should respond positively if Prabhakaran is judged to be sincere .
`` The issue here is , how to get it going .
Who is going to start the process , '' Saravanamuttu , of the independent Center for Policy Alternative , told The Associated Press .
The speech marks the end of Hero 's Week , commemorating rebel casualties .
About 57,000 people have been killed since the ethnic conflict between the minority Tamils and the majority Sinhalese erupted into war in 1983 .
Prabhakaran founded the Tigers in 1976 and commands the organization alone and unchallenged .
In recent weeks , both sides have shown signs of fatigue following a ferocious battle in September for the towns of Kilinochchi and Mankulam .
The towns lie on the vital north-south highway through rebel territory linking government-controlled territory to the Jaffna Peninsula .
The government said 535 soldiers and 620 rebels were killed , but the casualties were believed to be far higher .
