BOGOTA , Colombia --
Addressing a nation still in shock from one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives ever , new Colombian President Andres Pastrana pledged Friday that ending the 34-year -old civil war will be his top mission .
`` I assume the permanent leadership to build the peace , '' Pastrana told about 4,000 guests at Bolivar Plaza in downtown Bogota moments after he was sworn in for a four-year term as president .
`` That 's the promised land that we desire : a Colombia at peace . ''
Wearing a dark blue suit and smiling on a cloudy afternoon , Pastrana received the same yellow , blue and red presidential sash that his father -- Misael Pastrana , Colombia 's president from 1970 to 1974 -- once wore .
The 44-year -old former mayor of Bogota , who lost the 1994 presidential election to outgoing President Ernesto Samper , defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a June 21 runoff election .
Pastrana now heads Colombia 's first Conservative government in 12 years .
He inherits a nation racked by political violence , corruption , drug trafficking and economic stagnation .
In surprise attacks across the nation this week , leftist rebels killed more than 100 police and soldiers .
The offensive came just one month after Pastrana met with top guerrilla leaders in the mountains of Colombia and promised to initiate peace talks within the first 90 days of his term .
Many Colombians had expected Pastrana to elaborate on his plans to end the war in his inaugural address .
But he offered few details in his 25-minute speech .
The only concrete proposal that Pastrana offered Friday was to invest in social programs and infrastructure in war zones through a special fund backed by the government , international donations and `` peace bonds '' that will be sold to affluent Colombians .
Pastrana claimed that the nation was `` at the dawn of a new era . ''
Analysts cautioned , however , that the new president faces monumental tasks .
Peace negotiations , they say , will be problematic , because rebel forces are growing in size and territorial strength .
The country 's two main rebel groups -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , known as the FARC , and the National Liberation Army , or ELN -- number between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters .
`` The difficulties are enormous , '' said Alfredo Molano , a Colombian sociologist .
The guerrillas `` talk about peace , then they go out and launch attacks throughout the country , '' said Peter Romero , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter- American affairs , who was in Bogota for the inauguration .
`` I think there is an emerging credibility gap . ''
Unlike his predecessor , Pastrana can at least count on strong backing from the United States , which is providing Colombia with about $ 100 million in military aid this year to fight drug trafficking .
Relations between the nations were strained during the Samper administration , because the former president was elected in 1994 with the help of $ 6.1 million in donations from the Cali drug cartel .
The scandal crippled his administration , which was `` decertified '' by Washington for two straight years as an unreliable ally in the war on drugs .
On Friday , Pastrana vowed to lead `` the cleanest government in Colombian history '' and to vigorously prosecute public officials accused of corruption .
`` It is fair to say that our relationship now has an opportunity to turn the page , '' said Thomas `` Mac '' McLarty , President Clinton 's former chief of staff , who led the U.S. delegation at the inauguration ceremonies .
