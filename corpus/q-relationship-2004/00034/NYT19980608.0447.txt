SEOUL , South Korea --
Six months after Koreans elected Kim Dae -jung as president , economic pain is mounting with few signs of a turnaround in sight .
Economic output has fallen even more sharply than predicted -- 3.8 percent in the first quarter , while unemployment has outstripped economists ' forecasts , reaching 6.7 percent at the end of April .
The situation is likely to get worse before it gets better , most analysts believe .
`` They 're breaking with a social contract that 's been in place the last 40 years , '' said Linda Tsao -yang , the U.S. representative to the Asian Development Bank .
`` It 's going to be painful . ''
Still , some discern seeds of growth .
`` The process of growth is probably already under way , '' said the U.S. ambassador here , Stephen Bosworth .
`` It 's just overwhelmed by the more visible pain of restructuring . ''
Bosworth and others say anyone who anticipated an overnight transformation was simply unrealistic .
`` I think we built expectations too high , and when you do that , you are sure to disappoint , '' said You Jong -keun , governor of North Cholla province and economic adviser to Kim .
`` We could not have moved any faster . ''
The International Monetary Fund , which provided $ 58 billion in December to stave off Korean default , still claims South Korea as its star pupil in Asia and says that the government is ahead of schedule on many required changes .
`` What you 're seeing is the first stages of restructuring in the financial system and the corporations , and those reforms are going to have a negative impact , '' said John Dodsworth , senior resident representative of the IMF here .
`` At least in the next few months , they could be quite disruptive . ''
The banking system 's bad debts have continued to rise as debt-laden South Korean corporations continue to borrow .
And many of the chaebol , the sprawling conglomerates that dominate the economic landscape here and are widely blamed for South Korea 's structural woes , seem determined to continue doing business as usual .
By one measure , companies are paying a total of $ 6 billion a month to service their debts , an amount equal on an annual basis to more than half the nation 's export income last year .
Asset sales , which would help eliminate debt , have been sporadic .
The foreign investors that South Korea so desperately needs apparently still need to be convinced that the reforms under way are substantial .
But because the government of Kim , a former political prisoner , is determined to act in a democratic fashion , its ability to enforce change in private business is limited .
The government cannot , for example , force the banks to make more rational lending decisions or order the conglomerates to sell their assets , as it could in the past .
`` Our role has been reduced to that of a referee , '' said Hyun Oh -seok , general director of economic policy at the Finance and Economy Ministry .
`` The government sets up the rules , but others are the players . ''
Although officials bulldozed virtually the last remaining barrier to foreign investment last month , foreigners greeted the news by pulling so much money out of the stock market that it hit an 11-year low .
The market has since recovered somewhat , but remains shaky .
External factors beyond the government 's control have complicated matters , particularly the decline in the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar , and the weakness of the Japanese economy .
Concerns like Samsung Electronics , Daewoo and Pohang Iron and Steel compete head to head with Japanese companies , and the cheaper yen means much stiffer competition .
The Japanese market is also less able to absorb Korean goods .
The yen 's decline has made many aware of the soft underbelly of Korea 's surging trade surplus -- the hard-currency flow that keeps Korea 's foreign-exchange coffers full .
South Korea 's trade surplus is due more to a precipitous drop in imports than to increased demand for its products abroad .
The fall in imports has investors worried because it means that business at home is suffering badly .
Companies have not been importing the raw material , components and machinery they need , largely because they have had difficulty finding financing .
`` Many small and medium-sized companies that are doing well are going down because banks are rushing to recall their loans or they do n't have access to the credit needed to do business , '' said Yoon Young -mo , international secretary of the Korea Federation of Trade Unions , the more militant of the nation 's two labor groupings .
Although there are signs that the credit shortage is starting to abate , it has already put hundreds of thousands of people out of work .
The country 's 30 large conglomerates get most attention when it comes to labor issues , but they employ only about 5 percent of the work force and have thus far not resorted to sweeping layoffs .
Workers and small-company owners have borne the brunt of the restructuring , not the conglomerates for which the changes were intended .
`` Despite the fact that everyone is calling for reform in the chaebol system , what is happening is that because so many small and midsized companies are going under , the government is rushing to prop up the conglomerates to avoid making the situation even worse , '' Yoon said .
The government says that the conglomerates are restructuring but that the process is exceedingly slow .
Foreign companies have been buying their Korean counterparts ' stakes in joint ventures , but only a handful of outright asset sales have taken place .
These include the recent sale of the Hanwha group 's power-plant operations to AES Corp. of the United States for $ 874 million , the highest price paid so far for a Korean asset .
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. intends to invest $ 1 billion in Korea Life , giving it as much as 60 percent of the privately held insurer , the companies said on Monday .
Also on Monday , Reuters and Bloomberg News reported , Samsung Heavy Industries said it had signed a contract to sell its forklift truck business to Clark Material Handling of the United States for $ 30 million .
This follows the sale early in May of Samsung 's construction operations to Volvo for $ 720 million .
The practice of `` cooperative financing '' -- loans and loan extensions offered by bankers to big companies that would otherwise go bust -- continues with little apparent slackening .
The practice has delayed corporate restructuring by giving otherwise insolvent companies a new lease on life and added to the woes of the banking system .
Although government officials have declared that such loans would stop , $ 600 million in new loans were granted last month to the Dong Ah group , raising fresh doubt about Seoul 's commitment to banking reform .
No one is sure how vast the pool of nonperforming loans is .
Hyun of the Finance Ministry conceded that raising enough money to cover potential bad loans would be an uphill battle .
But action on this and other structural issues is necessary for the economy to recover , many analysts say .
`` Now that the reform process has begun , investors are beginning to look more closely on a micro level as to precisely what changes are taking place , '' Ms. Yang , the U.S. delegate to the Asian Development Bank , said .
`` They 'll have to see those changes before they 're convinced . ''
