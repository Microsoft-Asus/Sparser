									<a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText">The genetic code (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.4</span>) is rich with evolutionary implications. See what evolutionary deductions you can make from it by looking for patterns in the codons. For instance, notice that the 20 amino acids are not randomly scattered, but most amino acids are coded for by a similar set of codons. What evolutionary explanations can be given for this pattern? (<span class="Emphasis1">Hint:</span> there is one explanation relating to historical ancestry, and some less obvious ones of a "form-fits-function" type.)</p>

									<a name="para93"></a><p class="BlockText">A biologist inserts a gene from a human liver cell into the chromosome of a bacterium. The bacterium then transcribes this gene into mRNA and translates the mRNA into protein. The protein produced is useless and is found to contain many more amino acids than does the protein made by the eukaryotic cell. Explain why.</p>

What role should government play in identifying mutagens and regulating their release to the environment?</p>
