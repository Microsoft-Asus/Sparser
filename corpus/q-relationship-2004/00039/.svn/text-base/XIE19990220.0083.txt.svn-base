MOSCOW , February 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Saturday that Moscow wants a large-scale treaty with Japan but `` will not accept any options that would mean giving up the Kuril Islands . ''
Addressing local officials while making a stopover in Sakhalinsk on his way to Japan , Ivanov said `` it would be an anachronism to negotiate just a peace treaty with Japan half a century after the end of the Second World War , '' Interfax news agency reported .
`` We want it to be a treaty of peace , friendship , and cooperation , which will open large-scale prospects in all spheres , '' he said .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi vowed last year to reach a peace treaty before the year 2000 .
`` It 's hard to speak about the final form -LRB- of the treaty -RRB- today .
The talks will continue , '' Ivanov said .
`` The framework of a possible solution is absolutely clear , '' he said .
`` It should be mutually acceptable .
It should not hinder Russia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and should meet our national interests .
It should be based on the current realities , be supported by the population and adopted by both countries ' top legislatures , '' Ivanov said .
The four Kuril islands , known as the Northern Territories in Japan , have stalled relations between Moscow and Tokyo for decades .
Early last January , Japanese media reported that Tokyo was considering the possibility of concluding an interim agreement with Moscow on the transfer of two of the four islands to Japan and continuing talks on the territorial status of the remaining two islands .
Russia denied the reports as `` unfounded '' and said they were intended to disrupt public opinions .
The long island chain was given to Japan in 1875 by Russia in exchange for the northern half of Sakhalin Island .
During the World War II , Russia retook the islands from Japan along with the southern half of Sakhalin .
In 1951 , Japan relinquished all claims to the islands but later reversed its stance on the southern Kurils , stating that these islands had always been Japanese possessions .
