Eukaryotic cells face the same challenges as prokaryotic cells in expressing their genes, but with two main differences: the much greater size of the typical eukaryotic genome and the importance of cell specialization in multicellular eukaryotes. These two complications present a formidable information-processing task for the eukaryotic cell.

Consider the genome of a human cell. It has an estimated 35,000 genes--more than ten times that of a typical bacterium. It also includes an enormous amount of DNA that does not program the synthesis of RNA or protein. The entire mass of DNA must be precisely replicated with each turn of the cell cycle. Managing so much DNA requires that it be elaborately organized. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, DNA associates with proteins to form chromatin, but in the eukaryotic cell, the chromatin is ordered into higher structural levels. The light micrograph above gives a sense of the complex organization of chromatin in a developing salamander ovum. Part of the chromatin (white) is packed into the main axis of each of the chromosome's two chromatids, while other parts (red loops) are being actively transcribed. As in prokaryotes, transcription is the stage at which eukaryotic gene expression is most often regulated. In this chapter, you will learn more about the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes, the organization of nucleotide sequences in eukaryotic genomes, and the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene control. You will also learn about DNA changes that disrupt gene regulation and lead to cancer.





EUKARYOTIC CHROMATIN STRUCTURE

 

 Chromatin structure is based on successive levels of DNA packing



Let's start by looking at how eukaryotic cells pack their chromosomal DNA into chromatin.

 Gene amplification, loss, or rearrangement can alter a cell's genome during an organism's lifetime



Now we are ready to examine how genes and other DNA sequences are organized within the genome. Because most of this unit has focused on genes, you may be surprised to learn that genes make up only a tiny portion of the genomes of most multicellular eukaryotes.





THE CONTROL OF GENE EXPRESSION

 Post-transcriptional mechanisms play supporting roles in the control of gene expression



The rearrangement of antibody genes and other processes that alter DNA sequences in somatic cells are bona fide mechanisms for regulating gene expression. They are limited, however, to particular genes in certain cells. We now examine the more general mechanisms of gene control that are used to regulate most eukaryotic genes.





THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER

 

 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect the cell cycle



 

 Oncogene proteins and faulty tumor-suppressor proteins interfere with normal signaling pathways



 

 Multiple mutations underlie the development of cancer



In Chapter 12, we considered cancer as a set of diseases in which cells escape from the control mechanisms normally limiting their growth. Now that we have discussed the molecular basis of gene expression and its regulation, we are ready to look at cancer more closely.





 Chromatin structure is based on successive levels of DNA packing

Even bacterial DNA has packing. Typically containing only several million nucleotide pairs, the bacterial genome was once thought to be a naked circle of DNA without any particular folding pattern. Now we know that the DNA of the bacterial chromosome is associated with specific proteins and that it is coiled and looped in a complex but orderly manner.

Nevertheless, eukaryotic chromatin (FIGURE 19.1) is considerably more complex than bacterial chromatin. Eukaryotic DNA is precisely combined with a large amount of protein, and the resulting chromatin undergoes striking changes in the course of the cell cycle. During interphase, chromatin fibers are usually highly extended within the nucleus. When interphase cells are stained for light microscopy, the chromatin appears as a diffuse, colored mass. As you learned in Chapter 12, however, when a cell prepares for mitosis, its chromatin coils and folds up (condenses) to form a characteristic number of short, thick chromosomes that are distinguishable with the light microscope.

Fig 19-1. Levels of chromatin packing. This series of diagrams and transmission electron micrographs depicts a current model for the progressive stages of DNA coiling and folding that culminate in a highly condensed metaphase chromosome.

Eukaryotic chromosomes contain an enormous amount of DNA relative to their condensed length. Each chromosome contains a single linear DNA double helix that, in humans, averages about 2 &#160;X&#160; 108 nucleotide pairs. If extended, such a DNA molecule would be about 6 cm long, thousands of times longer than the diameter of a cell nucleus. All this DNA--as well as the DNA of the other 45 human chromosomes--fits into the nucleus through an elaborate, multilevel system of DNA packing. FIGURE 19.1 (preceding page) shows a model for this packing.

Nucleosomes, or "Beads on a String"

Proteins called histones are responsible for the first level of DNA packing in eukaryotic chromatin. In fact, the mass of histone in chromatin is approximately equal to the mass of DNA. Histones have a high proportion of positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine), and they bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA. (Recall that the phosphate groups of DNA give it a negative charge all along its length; see FIGURE 16.5.) The DNA-histone complex is chromatin in its most fundamental form. There are five types of histone. Histones are very similar from one eukaryote to another, and similar proteins are found even in bacteria. Apparently, the histone genes have been highly conserved during evolution.

In electron micrographs, unfolded chromatin has the appearance of beads on a string, as shown in FIGURE 19.1a. Each "bead" and its adjacent DNA form a nucleosome, the basic unit of DNA packing. The nucleosome bead consists of DNA wound around a protein core composed of two molecules each of four different types of histone: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A molecule of the fifth histone, called H1, attaches to the DNA near the bead when the chromatin undergoes the next level of packing.

The beaded string seems to remain essentially intact throughout the cell cycle. The histones leave the DNA only transiently during DNA replication, and they stay with the DNA during transcription. How can DNA be transcribed when it is wrapped around histones in nucleosomes? Researchers have learned that nucleosomes are dynamic structures. By changing shape and position, they can allow RNA-synthesizing polymerases to move along the DNA. Later in this chapter, we'll discuss some recent discoveries about the roles of nucleosomes in the regulation of gene expression.

Higher Levels of DNA Packing

The beaded string undergoes higher-order packing. This is clearest when the extended interphase chromatin condenses to produce the thickened, compact chromosomes we see during mitosis. In the laboratory, mitotic chromosomes can be isolated and unraveled to reveal several orders of chromatin coiling. FIGURE 19.1b-d illustrates the various structures in order of increasing compactness. With the aid of histone H1, the beaded string coils or folds to form a fiber roughly 30 nm in thickness, known as the 30-nm chromatin fiber (FIGURE 19.1b). The 30-nm fiber, in turn, forms loops called looped domains, which are attached to a chromosome scaffold made of nonhistone proteins. In a mitotic chromosome, the looped domains themselves coil and fold, further compacting all the chromatin to produce the characteristic metaphase chromosome you see in the micrograph at the bottom of FIGURE 19.1. We know that the packing steps are highly specific and precise, for particular genes always end up located at the same places in metaphase chromosomes.

Though interphase chromatin is generally much less condensed than the chromatin of mitotic chromosomes, it shows several of these same levels of higher-order packing. Much of the beaded string is compacted into a 30-nm fiber and then further folded into looped domains (as in the micrograph opening this chapter). Although an interphase chromosome lacks a discrete "scaffold," its looped domains seem to be attached to the nuclear lamina, on the inside of the nuclear envelope, and perhaps also to fibers of the nuclear matrix. These attachments may help organize regions of active transcription. The chromatin of each chromosome occupies a restricted area within the interphase nucleus, and the chromatin fibers of different chromosomes do not become entangled.

Even during interphase, portions of certain chromosomes in some cells exist in the highly condensed state represented in FIGURE 19.1d. This type of interphase chromatin, which is visible with a light microscope, is called heterochromatin, to distinguish it from the less compacted euchromatin ("true chromatin"). What is the function of this selective condensation in interphase cells? The formation of heterochromatin may be a sort of coarse adjustment in the control of gene expression, for heterochromatin DNA is not transcribed.





 Repetitive DNA and other noncoding sequences account for much of a eukaryotic genome

In prokaryotes, most of the DNA in a genome codes for protein (or tRNA and rRNA), with the small amount of noncoding DNA consisting mainly of regulatory sequences, such as promoters. The coding sequence of nucleotides along a prokaryotic gene proceeds from start to finish without interruption. In eukaryotic genomes, by contrast, most of the DNA--about 97%  in humans--does not encode protein or RNA. What does this DNA consist of? Some of it is known to be regulatory sequences, but much of it consists of sequences whose functions, if any, are not yet understood. This DNA includes introns, the stretches of noncoding DNA that often interrupt the coding sequences of eukaryotic genes (see FIGURE 17.9). Even more of the noncoding DNA consists of repetitive DNA, nucleotide sequences that are present in many copies in a genome, usually not within genes.

Tandemly Repetitive DNA

TABLE 19.1 lists the main categories of repetitive DNA, which occur in different amounts in different species. In mammals, about 10-15%  of the genome is tandemly repetitive DNA, short sequences repeated in series, as in the following example (showing one DNA strand only):&#160;...&#160; GTTACGTTACGTTACGTTACGTTACGTTAC&#160;...&#160; The number of repetitions of the GTTAC unit at a site in the genome could be as high as several hundred thousand. Repeated units are up to ten base pairs long.

Table 19-1. Types of Repetitive DNA

Tandemly Repetitive DNA (Satellite DNA)Repeated units at a site are usually identicalProportion of mammalian DNA:10-15% Length of each repeated unit:1-10 base pairsTotal length of repetitive DNA per site, in base pairs:Regular satellite DNA100,000-10 millionMinisatellite DNA100-100,000Microsatellite DNA10-100Interspersed Repetitive DNA"Copies" are very similar but not identicalProportion of mammalian DNA:25-40% Length of each repeated unit:100-10,000 base pairsNumber of repetitions per genome:10-1 millionThe nucleotide composition of tandemly repetitive DNA is often different enough from the rest of the cell's DNA to give the repetitive DNA an intrinsically different density, enabling researchers to isolate it by differential ultracentrifugation (as in the Meselson-Stahl experiment; see FIGURE 16.9). If the genomic DNA is cut into pieces before centrifugation, segments of different density migrate to different positions in the centrifuge tube. Repetitive DNA isolated in this way was originally called satellite DNA, because it appeared as a "satellite" band in the centrifuge tube, separate from the rest of the DNA. Now the term is often used for all tandemly repetitive DNA.

As TABLE 19.1 shows, satellite DNA is classified into three types, depending on the total length of the DNA at each site. Regular satellite DNA occurs in stretches over 100,000 base pairs long, while minisatellite and microsatellite subcategories have been created for sequences that appear in shorter stretches. Microsatellite DNA, with short units repeated only 10 to 100 times, has turned out to be extremely useful for DNA fingerprinting, as we'll discuss in Chapter 20.

A number of genetic disorders, including two you read about in Chapter 15, are caused by abnormally long stretches of tandemly repeated nucleotide triplets--a sort of microsatellite--within the affected gene. The first such "triplet repeat" sequence to be identified was the one responsible for fragile X syndrome, a major cause of mental retardation. In the normal allele for the fragile X gene, within the 5&#39; untranslated leader region of the first exon, the triplet CGG is repeated about 30 times; in a fragile X allele, the same triplet is repeated hundreds or even thousands of times, creating the fragile site. The lengthening of the repetitive DNA occurs in steps over a number of generations. Huntington's disease is also a triplet-repeat disorder, with a stretch of repeated CAG triplets that lengthens in a similar fashion. In this case, the triplet repeat is actually translated, and the resulting protein has a long string of glutamines, the amino acid encoded in DNA by CAG (recall that DNA sequences are given as they appear on the nontemplate strand). The dozen triplet-repeat disorders identified to date all affect the nervous system, and in all cases the number of repeats seems to correlate with the severity of the disease and the age of onset. Scientists do not yet know exactly how the extra repeats cause disorders; the mechanism undoubtedly varies with the gene.

Much of a genome's regular satellite DNA is located at chromosomal telomeres and centromeres, suggesting that this DNA plays a structural role for chromosomes. The DNA at centromeres is essential for the separation of chromatids in cell division (see Chapter 12), and along with other tandemly repetitive sequences, it may help organize the chromatin within the interphase nucleus. We discussed the DNA of telomeres, the tips of chromosomes, in Chapter 16. Besides protecting genes from being lost as the DNA shortens with each round of replication, telomeric DNA protects the chromosome by binding proteins that protect the ends from degradation and from joining to other chromosomes.

The importance of telomeres and centromeres has been highlighted by the creation of artificial chromosomes in the laboratory. The DNA used to make such chromosomes must, of course, include an origin of replication. But this is not sufficient; to function as a chromosome, it must also have a centromere and two telomeres. If an artificial chromosome has these features--no matter what the nature of its other DNA--a cell will be able to replicate it and distribute the copies properly to daughter cells.

Interspersed Repetitive DNA

In addition to tandemly repetitive DNA, eukaryotic genomes have huge amounts of interspersed repetitive DNA (see TABLE 19.1). The repeated units of this type of DNA are not next to each other; instead, they are scattered about the genome. A single unit is usually hundreds or even thousands of base pairs long, and the dispersed "copies" are similar but usually not identical to each other. Interspersed repetitive DNA makes up 25-40%  of most mammalian genomes. In humans and other primates, a large portion of this DNA (at least 5%  of the genome) consists of a family of similar sequences called Alu elements, for which each unit is about 300 nucleotide pairs long. Like the Huntington's disease triplet repeats, Alu elements are an exception to the notion that repetitive DNA is noncoding. Many Alu elements are transcribed into RNA molecules; their cellular function, if any, is unknown.

Although we know little about the functions of interspersed repetitive DNA, we do know how it comes to be both abundant and variable in location. Most such sequences, at least in mammals, seem to be transposons, the mobile genetic elements introduced in Chapter 18. We'll have more to say about eukaryotic transposons later in this chapter.





 Gene families have evolved by duplication of ancestral genes

As in prokaryotes, most eukaryotic genes are present as unique sequences, with only one copy per haploid set of chromosomes. However, some genes are present in more than one copy, and others closely resemble each other in nucleotide sequence. A collection of identical or very similar genes is called a multigene family. It is likely that the members of each family evolved from a single ancestral gene. Multigene families can be thought of as repetitive DNA with very long (gene-length) repeating units. The members of a multigene family may be clustered or dispersed in the genome.

Some multigene families consist of identical genes, usually clustered tandemly. Although the genes for histone proteins are a notable exception, multigene families of identical genes usually consist of genes for RNA products. An example is the family of identical genes for the three largest ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules (FIGURE 19.2). These rRNA molecules are encoded in a single transcription unit that is repeated tandemly hundreds to thousands of times in the genome of a multicellular eukaryote. The many copies enable cells to make the millions of ribosomes needed for active protein synthesis. The primary transcript is cleaved to yield the three rRNA molecules. These are then combined with proteins and one other kind of rRNA to form ribosomal subunits.

Fig 19-2. Part of a family of identical genes for ribosomal RNA.

The classic examples of multigene families of nonidentical genes are the two related families of genes that encode globins, the a and b polypeptide subunits of hemoglobin. One family, located on chromosome 16 in humans, encodes various versions of a-globin; the other, on chromosome 11, encodes versions of b-globin (FIGURE 19.3). Similarities in the sequences of the various globin genes indicate that the a-like globins and b-like globins all evolved from one common ancestral globin. The different versions of each globin subunit are expressed at different times in development, allowing hemoglobin to function effectively in the changing environment of the developing animal. In humans, for example, the embryonic and fetal forms of hemoglobin have a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult forms, ensuring the efficient transfer of oxygen from mother to developing fetus.

Fig 19-3. The evolution of human a-globin and b-globin gene families. The two kinds of polypeptides that make up hemoglobin are encoded by genes belonging to two gene families, which are found as clusters on two different chromosomes. Each family consists of a group of very similar, but not identical, genes. Noncoding DNA separates the functional genes within each family cluster, including pseudogenes (green). Shown here is a hypothesis for the evolution of the modern a- and b-globin gene families from a single ancestral globin gene.

How do families of genes arise from a single gene? The most likely explanation is that they arise by repeated gene duplication, which can result from errors during DNA replication and recombination. The differences among the genes in families of nonidentical genes probably arise from mutations that accumulate in the gene copies over many generations. The existence of DNA segments called pseudogenes is evidence for this process of gene duplication and mutation. Pseudogenes have sequences very similar to real genes but do not yield functional products. Presumably, over evolutionary time, random mutations have destroyed their function. The globin gene families include several pseudogenes within the stretches of noncoding DNA between the functional genes.

The location of the a-globin and b-globin families on different human chromosomes, as well as the dispersion of the genes of certain other gene families, probably arose by transposition, one of the topics in the next section.





 Gene amplification, loss, or rearrangement can alter a cell's genome during an organism's lifetime

We are used to the idea that, except for rare mutations, the nucleotide sequence of an organism's DNA is constant during its lifetime. However, there are a few important exceptions in which the DNA of somatic cells is altered in a systematic way. Because these changes do not affect gametes, they are not passed on to offspring, but they can and do have major effects on gene expression within particular cells and tissues.

Gene Amplification and Selective Gene Loss

Sometimes the number of copies of a gene or gene family temporarily increases in the cells of some tissues during a particular stage of development. For instance, consider the genes for ribosomal RNA in amphibians. As in most eukaryotes, multiple copies of these genes are built into the genome of every cell (the result of gene duplication in the evolutionary past). A developing ovum, however, synthesizes a million or more additional copies of the rRNA genes, which exist in nucleoli as tiny DNA circles separate from the chromosomes. This selective replication of certain genes, called gene amplification, is a potent way of increasing expression of the rRNA genes, enabling the developing egg cell to make enormous numbers of ribosomes. These ribosomes make possible a burst of protein synthesis once the egg is fertilized. The extra copies of the rRNA genes cannot replicate further and are broken down during early embryonic development.

Gene amplification has also been observed in cancer cells exposed to high concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs. While such drugs may kill a great many cells in a tumor, invariably some cells are resistant. These cells often contain amplified segments of DNA carrying genes conferring drug resistance. In the laboratory, increasing the concentration of such drugs leads to increasing resistance in the cell population by selecting for cells that have amplified these genes.

In certain insects, genes are selectively lost in certain tissues (although not in the cells that give rise to gametes, of course). In fact, whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes may be eliminated from certain cells early in insect development.

Rearrangements in the Genome

More common than gene amplification or loss is the shuffling of substantial stretches of DNA. Here we are talking not about the genetic recombination that goes on in meiosis but about rearrangements that change the loci of genes in somatic cells of an organism. Such rearrangements may have powerful effects on gene expression.

Transposons and Retrotransposons. All organisms seem to have transposons, stretches of DNA that can move from one location to another within the genome. Transposons were discussed in detail in FIGURES 18.16-18.18), and transposition was mentioned as a source of scattered gene families earlier in this chapter. Recall that if a transposon "jumps" into the middle of a coding sequence of another gene, it prevents the normal functioning of the interrupted gene (FIGURE 19.4). If the transposon inserts within a sequence that is involved in regulating transcription, the transposition may increase or decrease the production of one or more proteins. In some cases, the transposon itself carries a gene that is activated when it is inserted just downstream from an active promoter. Barbara McClintock was the first to discover transposons when she found evidence for mobile genetic elements that affect the color of developing corn kernels.

Fig 19-4. The effect of a transposon on flower color. Without the movement of a transposon, this morning glory flower would be entirely purple. The white portion of the flower (light blue-green in this photo) resulted from the movement of a transposon in the genome of one cell to a locus that determines purple flower color, destroying the function of the flower-color gene.

Recent studies have revealed that transposons actually make up over 50%  of the corn (maize) genome and 10%  of the human genome. Most of these transposons are retrotransposons, transposable elements that move within a genome by means of an RNA intermediate, a transcript of the retrotransposon DNA (FIGURE 19.5). To insert at another site, the RNA retrotransposon must be converted back to DNA. This is accomplished by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is encoded in the retrotransposon itself, along with an enzyme that catalyzes the insertion at a new site. Thus, reverse transcriptase can be present in cells not infected with retroviruses. (In fact, retroviruses may have evolved from escaped and packaged retrotransposons.) The Alu elements, mentioned earlier, are retrotransposons that do not code for reverse transcriptase but can move using enzymes encoded by other retrotransposons in the genome.

Fig 19-5. Retrotransposon movement. Notice that the retrotransposition mechanism is essentially identical to part of the retrovirus reproductive cycle (see FIGURE 18.7). By replicative transposition, as shown here, a retro-transposon can populate the genome of a multicellular eukaryote in huge numbers.

Immunoglobulin Genes. In vertebrates, at least one set of genes normally undergoes permanent rearrangements of DNA segments. These rearrangements occur in the developing immune system during cellular differentiation, the specialization in cellular structure and function. Several kinds of genes become rearranged as cells of the immune system differentiate. Let's look at the genes encoding antibodies, or immunoglobulins, proteins that specifically recognize and help combat viruses, bacteria, and other invaders of the body.

Immunoglobulins are made by cells of the immune system called B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. B lymphocytes are highly specialized, with each differentiated cell and its descendants producing one specific type of antibody that attacks a specific invader. As an unspecialized cell differentiates into a B lymphocyte, functional antibody genes are pieced together using segments from DNA regions that are physically separated in the genome of an embryonic cell (FIGURE 19.6).

Fig 19-6. DNA rearrangement in the maturation of an immunoglobulin (antibody) gene. The joining of V, J, and C regions of DNA in random combinations plays a major role in arming the immune system with an enormous variety of antibody-producing lymphocytes.

The basic immunoglobulin molecule is represented at the bottom right of FIGURE 19.6.. It consists of four polypeptide chains held together by disulfide bridges. Each chain has two major parts: a constant (C) region, which is the same for all antibodies of a particular class, and a variable (V) region. The variable region gives a particular antibody its unique function--the ability to recognize and bind to a specific foreign molecule. In the genome of an embryonic cell, the DNA sequence coding for the constant part of an antibody polypeptide is separated by a long stretch of DNA from a location containing hundreds of segments coding for variable regions. As a B lymphocyte differentiates, a variable segment of the DNA is connected to a constant segment by the deletion of intervening DNA. This occurs by a type of genetic recombination within the DNA (remember that this is not RNA splicing!). The joined segments form the continuous sequence of nucleotides that functions as the gene for one of the immunoglobulin polypeptides. The combining of different variable and constant regions in this way creates an enormous variety of different polypeptides. And antibody diversity is increased still more by the combining of polypeptides to form complete antibody molecules. As a result, the mature immune system, with millions of subpopulations of B lymphocytes, can make millions of different kinds of antibody molecules.





 Each cell of a multicellular eukaryote expresses only a small fraction of its genes

Interspersed within their masses of noncoding DNA, eukaryotic genomes may contain tens of thousands of genes. Which of these genes are to be expressed? Like unicellular organisms, the cells of multicellular organisms must continually turn certain genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments. In addition, gene expression must be controlled on a long-term basis for cellular differentiation, the divergence in form and function as cells become specialized during an organism's development. Highly specialized cells, such as those of muscle or nervous tissue, express only a tiny fraction of their genes. In fact, a typical human cell expresses only 3-5%  of its genes at any given time. The enzymes that transcribe DNA must locate the right genes at the right time, a task no easier than finding a needle in a haystack. When gene expression goes awry, serious imbalances and diseases, including cancer, can arise. Thus, the question of how eukaryotic genes are regulated is paramount for medical research as well as for basic biology.

Only 35 years ago, an understanding of the mechanisms that control gene expression in eukaryotes seemed almost hopelessly out of reach. Since then, new research methods have empowered molecular biologists to begin to solve these mysteries. Equipped with DNA technology for isolating individual genes and sequencing DNA (discussed in Chapter 20), biologists are now uncovering many of the details of eukaryotic gene regulation.

Despite the extra "nuts and bolts" it requires, the control of gene activity in eukaryotes involves some of the same basic principles as prokaryotic gene regulation. In all organisms, the expression of specific genes is most commonly regulated at the level of transcription by DNA-binding proteins that also interact with other proteins and often with external signals. For that reason, the term gene expression is often equated with gene activity--that is, transcription--for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the greater complexity of eukaryotic cell structure and function provides opportunities for controlling gene expression at additional stages.





 The control of gene expression can occur at any step in the pathway from gene to functional protein: an overview

FIGURE 19.7 is an overview of the entire process of gene expression in a eukaryotic cell. The figure highlights key stages in the expression of a protein-coding gene, from chromatin changes that unpack the DNA, through transcription, RNA processing, and translation, to various alterations of the protein product. The expression of a given gene will not necessarily involve every stage shown; for example, not every polypeptide is cleaved. The main lesson is that each stage is a potential control point where gene expression can be turned on or off, speeded up, or slowed down. The figure omits details and does not convey the web of control that connects different genes and their products. In the following three sections, we'll examine some of the important control points more closely.

Fig 19-7. Opportunities for the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The nuclear envelope separating transcription from translation in eukaryotic cells offers opportunity for post-transcriptional control in the form of RNA processing that is absent in bacteria. In addition, eukaryotes have a greater variety of control mechanisms operating before transcription and after translation. In this diagram, the processes that offer opportunities for regulation are highlighted by white or yellow boxes. As in prokaryotes, transcription initiation is the most important control point.





 Chromatin modifications affect the availability of genes for transcription

The organization of chromatin discussed earlier in the chapter serves a dual purpose. One function is to pack the DNA into a compact form that fits inside the nucleus of a cell. The other main function is regulatory: The physical state of DNA in or near a gene is important in helping control whether the gene is available for transcription. Thus, the genes of heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed, presumably because transcription proteins cannot reach the DNA. Also, a gene's location relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether it is transcribed. A flurry of recent research indicates that chemical modifications of chromatin play key roles in both chromatin structure and the regulation of transcription. Especially important are DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Both are catalyzed by specific enzymes.

DNA Methylation

DNA methylation is the attachment of methyl groups (--CH3) to DNA bases after DNA is synthesized. The DNA of most plants and animals has methylated bases, usually cytosine. About 5%  of the cytosine bases in methylated eukaryotic DNA have methyl groups. Inactive DNA, such as that of inactivated mammalian X chromosomes, is generally highly methylated compared to DNA that is actively transcribed, although there are exceptions. Comparison of the same genes in different types of tissues shows that the genes are usually more heavily methylated in cells where they are not expressed. In addition, demethylating certain inactive genes (removing their extra methyl groups) turns them on.

At least in some species, DNA methylation seems to be essential for the long-term inactivation of genes that occurs during cellular differentiation in the embryo. In organisms as different as mice and Arabidopsis (a plant), deficient DNA methylation--resulting from lack of a methylating enzyme, for example--causes abnormalities in embryonic development. Once methylated, genes usually stay that way through successive cell divisions. Methylation enzymes act at DNA sites where one strand is already methylated and thus correctly methylate the daughter strand after each round of DNA replication. In this way, methylation patterns are passed on, and cells forming specialized tissues keep a chemical record of what occurred during embryonic development. A methylation pattern maintained in this way also accounts for genomic imprinting in mammals, where methylation permanently turns off either the maternal or paternal allele of certain genes at the start of development (see FIGURE 15.15).

Histone Acetylation

There is mounting evidence that histone acetylation and deacetylation play a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription. Histone acetylation is the attachment of acetyl groups (--COCH3) to certain amino acids of histone proteins; deacetylation is the removal of acetyl groups. When the histones of a nucleosome are acetylated, they change shape so that they grip the DNA less tightly. As a result, transcription proteins have easier access to genes in the acetylated region. Researchers have shown that some enzymes that acetylate or deacetylate histones are closely associated with or even components of the transcription factors that bind to promoters (see FIGURE 17.7). In other words, histone acetylation and the initiation of gene transcription seem to be coupled structurally as well as functionally. Moreover, researchers have discovered that certain proteins that bind to methylated DNA recruit histone deacetylation enzymes, thus providing a mechanism by which DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can cooperate to repress transcription. In summary, key enzymes that modify chromatin structure are apparently integral parts of the cell's machinery for regulating transcription.





 Transcription initiation is controlled by proteins that interact with DNA and with each other

If chromatin-modifying enzymes provide a coarse adjustment of gene expression by making a region of DNA either more available or less available for transcription, then fine-tuning begins with the interaction of transcription factors with DNA sequences that control specific genes. Indeed, once a gene is "unpacked," the initiation of transcription is the most important and universally used control point in gene expression. Before looking at control mechanisms, let's review the structure of a typical eukaryotic gene and its transcript.

Organization of a Typical Eukaryotic Gene

A eukaryotic gene and the DNA elements (segments) that control it are typically organized as shown in FIGURE 19.8, which reviews and extends what you learned about eukaryotic genes in Chapter 17. One striking difference between this gene and a prokaryotic gene is the presence of introns, noncoding sequences interspersed between coding sequences, the exons. Recall from Chapter 17 that a cluster of proteins called a transcription initiation complex assembles on the promoter sequence at the "upstream" end of the gene, and one of the -proteins, RNA polymerase, proceeds to transcribe the gene. The introns are removed from the primary transcript during RNA processing, so they do not appear in the mature mRNA. The eukaryotic processing of pre-mRNA usually also includes the addition of a modified guanosine triphosphate cap to its 5&#39; end and a poly(A) tail to its 3&#39; end. Another distinctive feature of the eukaryotic gene illustrated in FIGURE 19.8 is the relatively large number of control elements associated with it. Control elements are simply segments of noncoding DNA that help regulate transcription of a gene by binding proteins--transcription factors. (Strictly speaking, control elements include promoters.)

Fig 19-8. A eukaryotic gene and its transcript. Each functional eukaryotic gene has a promoter, a DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds (with the help of transcription factors) and starts transcription, proceeding "downstream." The 3&#39; end of the transcript is determined by an RNA sequence encoded by a terminator located near the end of the last exon. RNA-processing enzymes immediately add a 5&#39; cap and then a poly(A) tail to the primary transcript, and a spliceosome excises the introns. The resulting mRNA, ready for export to the cytoplasm, includes leader and trailer regions that will not be translated. Involved in regulating the initiation of transcription are a number of control elements (orange), DNA sequences located near (proximal to) or far from (distal to) the promoter. Distal control elements called enhancers can lie either up- stream or downstream of the gene.

The Role of Transcription Factors

As you learned in Chapter 17, eukaryotic RNA polymerase alone cannot initiate transcription of a gene; it is dependent on transcription factors. The transcription factors mentioned in Chapter 17 are essential for the transcription of all protein-coding genes (see FIGURE 17.7). Recall that only one of these transcription factors independently recognizes a DNA sequence, the TATA box within the promoter; the other transcription factors primarily recognize proteins, including each other and RNA polymerase. Protein-protein interactions are crucial to the initiation of eukaryotic transcription. Only when the complete initiation complex has assembled can the polymerase begin to move along the DNA template strand, producing a complementary strand of RNA.

However, the interaction of transcription factors and RNA polymerase with the promoter as summarized so far usually initiates transcription inefficiently, producing only a low rate of initiation and few RNA transcripts. The keys to high levels of eukaryotic transcription are the control elements. These DNA sequences greatly improve the efficiency of promoters by binding additional transcription factors.

As you can see in FIGURE 19.8, some of the control elements on the DNA are close to the promoter; in fact, some biologists include these proximal control elements in what they call the promoter. The more distant distal control elements, called enhancers, may be thousands of nucleotides away from the promoter and may even be downstream of the gene or within an intron. The associations between transcription factors and enhancers play an important role in the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. How do segments of DNA so far away from the promoter influence transcription? Apparently, bending of the DNA enables the transcription factors bound to enhancers to contact proteins of the transcription initiation complex at the promoter (FIGURE 19.9). A transcription factor that binds to an enhancer and stimulates transcription of a gene is termed an activator. Activators help position the initiation complex on the promoter.

Fig 19-9. A model for enhancer action. Bending of the DNA enables enhancers to influence a promoter hundreds or even thousands of nucleotides away. Transcription factors called activators bind to the enhancer DNA sequences and then to proteins of the transcription initiation complex. In the process, they facilitate the correct positioning of the complex on the promoter and the initiation of RNA synthesis.

Do eukaryotic cells also have transcription factors that function as repressors, as bacteria have? Yes, there is evidence for eukaryotic repressors. Some of them bind selectively to DNA control elements called silencers, which may be analogous to enhancers. Activators, though, are probably more important than such repressors, because the main regulatory mode in eukaryotic cells seems to be transcriptional activation of otherwise silent genes. The mechanisms responsible for eukaryotic gene silencing--that is, repression--may operate mostly at the level of chromatin modification (for example, DNA methylation).

In any case, the direct control of transcription largely depends on regulatory proteins that bind selectively to DNA and to other proteins. Hundreds of transcription factors have been discovered in eukaryotes. As numerous as these proteins are, however, they follow a few basic structural principles. A transcription factor generally has a DNA-binding domain, a part of its three-dimensional structure that binds to DNA. There are only a few major types of these domains (FIGURE 19.10). In addition, each transcription factor has a protein-binding domain that recognizes another transcription factor.

Fig 19-10. Three of the major types of DNA-binding domains in transcription factors. The parts of these structural motifs that interact with DNA are mostly a helices (shown as cylinders) that fit into the larger ("major") groove of the double helix. Variations in amino acid sequence within these helices are responsible for the recognition of specific DNA sequences by the protein.

Considering the challenge of regulating the tens of thousands of genes in a typical animal or plant cell, the number of completely different nucleotide sequences found in DNA control elements is surprisingly small. Members of a dozen or so sequences about four to ten base pairs long appear again and again in the control elements for different genes. For many genes, the particular combination of control elements associated with the gene may be more important than the presence of a control element unique to the gene.

Coordinately Controlled Genes

How does the eukaryotic cell deal with genes of related function that need to be turned on or off at the same time? In Chapter 18, you learned that in prokaryotes, such coordinately controlled genes are often clustered into an operon; they lie adjacent to each other in the DNA molecule and share a promoter and other control elements located at the upstream end of the cluster. The genes of the operon are transcribed sequentially into a single mRNA molecule and are translated together. Such operons have not been found in eukaryotic cells, with rare exceptions. Genes coding for the enzymes of a metabolic pathway, for example, are often scattered over different chromosomes in a eukaryotic genome. Even when genes for related functions are located near one another on the same chromosome, each gene has its own promoter and is individually transcribed. Nevertheless, scattered collections of eukaryotic genes are often coordinately expressed.

Coordinate gene expression in eukaryotes probably depends on the association of a specific control element or collection of control elements with every gene of a dispersed group. Copies of the transcription factors that recognize these control elements bind to them, promoting simultaneous transcription of the genes. One example of such coordinate control in eukaryotes is the activation of a variety of genes by a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones--sex hormones, for example--have multiple effects on the body. As you may recall from FIGURE 11.10, a steroid hormone functions as a chemical signal by entering a cell and binding to a specific receptor protein in the cytoplasm or nucleus. When activated by steroid binding, a steroid receptor functions as a transcription activator. Every gene to be turned on by that hormone has a control element recognized by that activator.

Most other kinds of signal molecules, such as nonsteroid hormones or the extracellular signals exchanged by cells in a developing embryo, bind to receptors on the receiving cell's surface and never actually enter the cell. But they can control gene expression indirectly by triggering signal-transduction pathways that lead to the activation of particular transcription factors (see FIGURE 11.17). The principle of coordinate regulation remains the same: Genes with the same control elements are activated by the same chemical signals. Systems for coordinating gene regulation probably evolved by the duplication and distribution of control elements within the genome.





 Post-transcriptional mechanisms play supporting roles in the control of gene expression

Transcription alone does not constitute gene expression. The expression of a protein-coding gene is ultimately measured in terms of the amount of functional protein a cell makes, and much happens between the synthesis of the RNA transcript and the activity of the protein in the cell. In theory, gene expression may be blocked or stimulated at any post-transcriptional step (see FIGURE 19.7). By using regulatory mechanisms that operate after transcription, a cell can rapidly fine-tune gene expression in response to environmental changes without altering its transcription patterns.

RNA processing in the nucleus and the export of mature RNA to the cytoplasm provide several opportunities for controlling gene expression that are not available in bacteria. One example of regulation at the RNA-processing level is alternative RNA splicing, in which different mRNA molecules are produced from the same primary transcript, depending on which RNA segments are treated as exons and which as introns (FIGURE 19.11). Regulatory proteins specific to a cell type control intron-exon choices by binding to regulatory sequences within the primary transcript.

After RNA processing, other stages of gene expression that the cell may regulate are mRNA degradation, translation initiation, and protein processing and degradation.

Regulation of mRNA Degradation

The life span of mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm is an important factor in determining the pattern of protein synthesis in a cell. Prokaryotic mRNA molecules typically have very short lives; they are degraded by enzymes after only a few minutes. This is one reason bacteria can vary their patterns of protein synthesis so quickly in response to environmental changes. In contrast, mRNA lifetimes in multicellular eukaryotes are typically hours and can be days or even weeks. A striking example of long-lived mRNA is found in developing red blood cells, which are factories for the production of the protein hemoglobin. The mRNAs for the hemoglobin polypeptides (a-globin and b-globin) are unusually stable and are translated repeatedly in these cells.

Recent research on yeasts suggests that a common pathway of mRNA breakdown begins with the enzymatic shortening of the poly(A) tail. This helps trigger the action of enzymes that remove the 5&#39; cap (the two ends of the mRNA may be briefly held together by the proteins involved). The removal of the cap, a critical step, is also regulated by particular nucleotide sequences in the mRNA. Once the cap is removed, nuclease enzymes rapidly chew up the mRNA from its 5&#39; end.

Nucleotide sequences that affect mRNA stability are often found in the untranslated trailer region at the 3&#39; end of the molecule (see FIGURE 19.8). In one experiment, researchers transferred such a sequence from the short-lived mRNA for a growth factor to the 3&#39; end of a normally stable globin mRNA. The globin mRNA was quickly degraded.

Control of Translation

Most translational control mechanisms block the initiation stage of polypeptide synthesis, when ribosomal subunits and the initiator tRNA attach to an mRNA (see FIGURE 17.15). Translation of specific mRNAs can be blocked by regulatory proteins that bind to specific sequences or structures within the leader region at the 5&#39; end of the mRNA, preventing the attachment of ribosomes. This mechanism is important in embryonic development: The mother stores in the ovum a variety of mRNAs that are not translated until specific stages after fertilization.

Protein factors required to initiate translation in eukaryotes offer targets for simultaneously controlling the translation of all the mRNA in a cell. One example of such "global" control involves hemoglobin. A functional hemoglobin molecule has four heme groups, one attached to each polypeptide (see FIGURE 19.3). If hemes are in short supply in a developing red blood cell, a regulatory protein inactivates an essential translation initiation factor by phosphorylating it. This inhibits all translation, but mainly affects translation of hemoglobin mRNA, which constitutes most of the mRNA in the cell.

Global control of translation is important in embryonic development. For example, the egg cells of many organisms synthesize and store large numbers of mRNA molecules that are not translated until just after fertilization. At that point, translation is triggered by the sudden activation of translation initiation factors. The response is a burst of synthesis of particular proteins. Some plants and algae store mRNAs during periods of darkness; light then triggers the reactivation of the translational apparatus.

Protein Processing and Degradation

The final opportunities for controlling gene expression occur after translation. Often, eukaryotic polypeptides must be processed to yield functional protein molecules. The cleavage of the initial insulin polypeptide to form the active hormone is an example. In addition, many proteins require chemical modifications to function. For instance, proteins destined for the animal cell surface must acquire sugars, and regulatory proteins are commonly activated or inactivated by the reversible addition of phosphate groups. Moreover, polypeptides must often be transported to targeted destinations in the cell in order to function. Regulation might occur at any of the steps involved in modifying or transporting a protein.

Abnormal targeting of a protein can have serious consequences, as, for example, in cystic fibrosis. This disease results from mutations in the gene for a protein that functions as a chloride ion channel. The defective protein never reaches its final destination in the cell, the plasma membrane, and is rapidly degraded.

In addition to degrading defective and damaged proteins, the cell limits the lifetimes of normal proteins by selective degradation. Many proteins, such as the cyclins involved in regulating the cell cycle, must be relatively short-lived if the cell is to function appropriately (see FIGURE 12.14). To mark a particular protein for destruction, the cell commonly attaches molecules of a small protein called ubiquitin to the protein. Giant protein complexes called proteasomes then recognize the ubiquitin and degrade the tagged protein (FIGURE 19.12). The importance of proteasomes is underscored by the finding that mutations making cell cycle proteins impervious to proteasome degradation can lead to cancer.

In most cases, the proteins attacked by a proteasome have been tagged with short chains of ubiquitin, a small protein. 
			  
		 Enzymes in the cytosol attach ubiquitin molecules to a protein. (It is not known how the protein is selected.) 
			  
		 A proteasome recognizes the ubiquitinated protein, unfolds it, and sequesters it in its central cavity. 
			  
		 Enzymatic components of the proteasome cut the protein into small peptides, which can be further degraded by cytosolic enzymes. Steps 1 and 3 require ATP. Eukaryotic proteasomes are as massive as ribosomal subunits and are distributed throughout the cell. Their barrel-like shape somewhat resembles that of chaperone proteins, which nurture protein structure rather than destroy it (see FIGURE 5.26).





 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect the cell cycle

Certain genes normally regulate cell growth and division--the cell cycle--and mutations that alter those genes in somatic cells can lead to cancer. The agent of such change can be random spontaneous mutation. However, it is likely that many cancer-causing mutations result from environmental influences such as chemical carcinogens, physical mutagens such as X-rays, or certain viruses. In fact, a breakthrough in understanding cancer came from the study of tumors induced by viruses. This research led to the discovery of cancer-causing genes called oncogenes in certain retroviruses (from the Greek onco, tumor). Subsequently, close counterparts of these oncogenes were found in the genomes of humans and other animals. The normal cellular genes, called proto-oncogenes, code for proteins that stimulate normal cell growth and division. (To review the cell cycle, see Chapter 12.)

How might a proto-oncogene--a gene that has an essential function in normal cells--become an oncogene, a cancer-causing gene? In general, an oncogene arises from a ge-netic change that leads to an increase in either the amount of the proto-oncogene's protein product or the intrinsic activity of each protein molecule. The genetic changes that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes fall into three main categories: movement of DNA within the genome, amplification of a proto-oncogene, and point mutation in a proto-oncogene (FIGURE 19.13). Malignant cells are frequently found to contain chromosomes that have broken and rejoined incorrectly, translocating fragments from one chromosome to another (see FIGURE 15.13). A proto-oncogene ending up in the joint region may now lie adjacent to an especially active promoter (or other control element) that increases transcription of the gene, making it an oncogene. An increase in gene expression can also arise when a proto-oncogene comes under the control of a more active promoter by transposition of either the gene or the promoter within a chromosome. The second main type of genetic change, amplification, increases the number of copies of the gene in the cell. The third possibility is a point mutation that changes the gene's protein product to one that is more active or more resistant to degradation than the normal protein. All these mechanisms can lead to abnormal stimulation of the cell cycle and put the cell on the path to malignancy.

Fig 19-13. Genetic changes that can turn proto-oncogenes into oncogenes.

In addition to mutations affecting growth-stimulating proteins, changes in genes whose normal products inhibit cell division also contribute to cancer. Such genes are called tumor-suppressor genes because the proteins they encode normally help prevent uncontrolled cell growth. Any mutation that decreases the normal activity of a tumor-suppressor protein may contribute to the onset of cancer, in effect stimulating growth through the absence of suppression. The protein products of tumor-suppressor genes have various functions. For instance, some tumor-suppressor proteins normally repair damaged DNA, a function that prevents the cell from accumulating -cancer-causing mutations. Other tumor-suppressor proteins control the adhesion of cells to each other or to an extracellular matrix; proper cell anchorage is crucial in normal tissues--and often absent in cancers. Still other tumor-suppressor proteins are components of cell-signaling pathways that inhibit the cell cycle.

We'll encounter some important tumor-suppressor proteins and oncogene proteins in the next section, as we examine their roles in cell-signaling pathways.





 Oncogene proteins and faulty tumor-suppressor proteins interfere with normal signaling pathways

Let's take a closer look at what the protein products of cancer genes do--or fail to do--in the cell. We will focus on the products of two key genes, the ras proto-oncogene and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Mutations in these genes are very common in human cancers: ras is mutated in about 30%  of human cancers; for p53, the frequency is close to 50% .

Both the Ras protein and the p53 protein are components of signal-transduction pathways that convey external signals to the DNA in the cell's nucleus. You saw a generalized version of such a pathway in FIGURE 11.17. Now, in FIGURE 19.14a you can see that Ras, the product of the ras gene, is a G protein that relays a growth signal from a growth factor receptor on the plasma membrane to a cascade of protein kinases. The cellular response at the end of the pathway is the synthesis of a protein that stimulates the cell cycle. Normally, such a pathway will not operate unless triggered by the appropriate growth factor. However, an oncogene protein that is a hyperactive version of a protein in the pathway can increase cell division even in the absence of growth factor. Many ras oncogenes have a point mutation that leads to a hyperactive version of the Ras protein, one that issues signals on its own. In fact, hyperactive versions or excess amounts of any of the pathway's components can have the same outcome: excessive cell division.

Fig 19-14. Signaling pathways that regulate cell growth. Both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways regulate the cell cycle, commonly by influencing transcription. Cancer can result from aberrations in such pathways.

FIGURE 19.14b shows a comparable growth-inhibiting pathway, in which a growth-inhibiting signal leads to the synthesis of a protein that suppresses the cell cycle. Thus, the genes for the components of the pathway act as tumor-suppressor genes (as do genes whose products interfere with the growth-stimulating pathway). The tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the wild-type p53 gene is a transcription factor that promotes the synthesis of growth-inhibiting proteins. That is why a mutation knocking out the p53 gene can lead to excessive cell growth and cancer.

The modestly titled p53 gene, named for the 53,000-dalton molecular weight of its protein product, is often called the "guardian angel of the genome." Damage to the cell's DNA acts as a signal that leads to the expression of the p53 gene. Once made, the p53 protein functions as a transcription factor for several genes. Often it activates a gene called p21, whose product halts the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing time for the cell to repair the DNA; the protein p53 can also turn on genes directly involved in DNA repair. When DNA damage is irreparable, p53 activates "suicide" genes, whose protein products cause cell death by a process called apoptosis (see FIGURE 21.18). Thus, in at least three ways, p53 prevents a cell from passing on mutations due to DNA damage. If mutations do accumulate and the cell survives through many divisions--as is more likely if the p53 tumor-suppressor gene is defective or missing--cancer may ensue.





 Multiple mutations underlie the development of cancer

More than one somatic mutation is generally needed to produce all the changes characteristic of a full-fledged cancer cell. This may help explain why the incidence of cancer increases greatly with age. If cancer results from an accumulation of mutations and if mutations occur throughout life, then the longer we live, the more likely we are to develop cancer.

The model of a multi-step path to cancer is well supported by studies of one of the best understood types of human cancer, colorectal cancer. About 135,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States. Like most cancers, colorectal cancer develops gradually (FIGURE 19.15). The first sign is often a polyp, which is a small, benign growth in the colon lining. The cells of the polyp look normal, although they divide unusually frequently. The tumor grows and may eventually become malignant. The development of a malignant tumor is paralleled by a gradual accumulation of mutations that activate oncogenes and knock out tumor-suppressor genes. A ras oncogene and a mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene are often involved.

Fig 19-15. A multi-step model for the development of colorectal cancer. Affecting the colon and/or rectum, this type of cancer is one of the best understood. Changes in a tumor parallel a series of genetic changes, including mutations affecting several tumor-suppressor genes (such as p53) and the ras proto-oncogene. Mutations of tumor-suppressor genes often entail loss (deletion) of the gene. APC stands for "adenomatous polyposis coli"; mutant APC alleles are carried in many families predisposed to colorectal cancer. DCC stands for "deleted in colorectal cancer." Other mutation sequences can also lead to cancer.

About a half dozen changes must occur at the DNA level for a cell to become fully cancerous. These usually include the appearance of at least one active oncogene and the mutation or loss of several tumor-suppressor genes. Furthermore, since mutant tumor-suppressor alleles are usually recessive, mutations must knock out both alleles in a cell's genome to block tumor suppression. (Most oncogenes, on the other hand, behave as dominant alleles.) Finally, in many malignant tumors, the gene for telomerase is activated. This enzyme prevents the erosion of the ends of the chromosomes, thus removing a natural limit on the number of times the cells can divide (see pp. 299-301).

Viruses seem to play a role in about 15%  of human cancer cases worldwide. For example, retroviruses are involved in some types of leukemia, hepatitis viruses can cause liver cancer, and certain wart viruses promote the development of cancer of the cervix. Viruses contribute to cancer development by integrating their genetic material into the DNA of infected cells. By this process, a retrovirus may donate an oncogene to the cell. Alternatively, viral DNA may insert into a cellular genome in a way that disrupts a tumor-suppressor gene or converts a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.

The fact that multiple genetic changes are required to produce a cancer cell helps explain the predispositions to cancer that run in some families. An individual inheriting an oncogene or a mutant allele of a tumor-suppressor gene will be one step closer to accumulating the necessary mutations for cancer to develop.

Geneticists are now devoting much effort to finding inherited cancer alleles so that predisposition to certain cancers can be detected early in life. About 15%  of colorectal cancers, for example, involve inherited mutations. Some of these affect DNA repair genes. Many others affect a tumor-suppressor gene called APC (see FIGURE 19.15). This gene seems to have multiple functions in the cell, including regulation of cell migration and adhesion. In 1997, researchers discovered a previously unrecognized mutation in APC carried by 6%  of Ashkenazic Jews, making it the most common cancer-predisposing mutation yet found in a defined ethnic group.

Inherited alleles involved in breast cancer are also being scrutinized. Understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer is particularly important because it is the second most common type of cancer in the United States, striking over 180,000 women (and some men) each year. In 5-10%  of breast cancer cases, there is evidence of a strong inherited predisposition. In 1994 and 1995, researchers identified two genes involved in these breast cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA stands for BReast CAncer). Mutations in either gene increase the risk of developing breast cancer, and of ovarian cancer as well. Both genes are considered tumor-suppressor genes because their wild-type alleles protect against breast cancer and because their mutant alleles are recessive. However, determining what the normal products of BRCA1 and BRCA2 actually do in the cell has proved very difficult. One hypothesis is that one or both proteins are involved in DNA repair. Whatever the answer, the study of these and other genes associated with inherited cancer may lead to new methods for early diagnosis and treatment of all cancers. The DNA technologies you will learn about in the next Chapter figure prominently in this research.
