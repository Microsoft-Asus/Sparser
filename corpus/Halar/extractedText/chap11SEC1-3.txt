SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS

 

 Pathways relay signals from receptors to cellular responses



 

 Protein phosphorylation, a common mode of regulation in cells, is a major mechanism of signal transduction



 

 Certain small molecules and ions are key components of signaling pathways (second messengers)



When signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins, like most of those we have discussed, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a multistep pathway. One benefit of such pathways is the possibility of greatly amplifying a signal. If some of the molecules in a pathway transmit the signal to multiple molecules of the next component in the series, the result can be a large number of activated molecules at the end of the pathway. In other words, a small number of extracellular signal molecules can produce a large cellular response. Moreover, multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation than simpler systems do, as we'll discuss later.
