Chapter 53: COMMUNITY ECOLOGY

WHAT IS A COMMUNITY?

   Contrasting views of communities are rooted in the individualistic and interactive hypotheses

   The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models



INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

   Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism

   Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics

   Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure

   The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators



DISTURBANCE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

   Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances

   Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance

   Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance



BIOGEOGRAPHIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE BIODIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES

   Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance

   Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient

   Species richness is related to a community's geographic size

   Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland

On your next walk through a field or woodland, or even across campus or through a park, try to observe some of the interactions among the species present. You may see birds using trees as nesting sites, bees pollinating flowers, shelf fungi growing on trees, caterpillars feeding on leaves, spiders trapping insects in their webs, ferns growing in shade provided by trees--a sample of the many interactions that exist in any ecological theater. In addition to the physical and chemical factors discussed in Chapter 50, an organism's environment includes other individuals of the same species as well as populations of other species living in the same area. Such an assemblage of species living close enough together for potential interaction is called a biological community. In the photograph that opens this chapter, the lion, the zebra, the hyena, the vultures, and the grasses and other plants are all members of a grassland community in East Africa.

This chapter examines the different kinds of interactions among organisms and addresses the central issue in community ecology: What factors are most significant in structuring a community--in determining its species composition and the relative abundance of species present?
