Branched, independent sporophytes probably evolved next. The evidence for this is provided by a group of Silurian fossils with the long descriptive name <span class="Emphasis2">protracheophyte</span> ("before vascular plants") <span class="Emphasis2">polysporangiophytes</span> ("plants producing many sporangia"). We’ll abbreviate by just using the first part of the name.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Protracheophytes were like bryophytes in lacking lignified vascular tissue, but were different in having branched sporophytes that were not dependent on gametophytes for their growth. Branched sporophytes make more complex bodies possible and also enable individual plants to produce many more spores. And more complex forms with multiple sporangia would stand a better chance of surviving and reproducing in spite of losing some of their vegetation and sporangia to herbivores. In contrast to modern vascular plants, which have much reduced gametophytes, fossils of early species indicate life cycles with gametophytes and sporophytes that were about equal in size.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
