WASHINGTON --
The FBI is proposing to create a new division devoted solely to rooting out spies , part of a government-wide overhaul of counterintelligence underway as a result of failures to address suspicions that China tried for two decades to steal nuclear secrets , government officials said Friday .
After the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union , American intelligence agencies increasingly focused on fighting terrorism , believing that espionage would become less of a threat .
As a result , counterintelligence efforts dwindled , according to experts inside and outside the government .
At the FBI , for example , the national security division added counterterrorism activities to its traditional emphasis on fighting espionage .
Officials said that there was a growing sense that as the battle against terrorism assumed more importance , counter espionage operations were given short shrift .
Now officials are proposing new ways for the government to organize to emphasize both threats , the officials said .
The FBI director , Louis J. Freeh , has proposed splitting the national security division into two divisions , one to fight terrorism and the other to root out spies , which would be led by assistant directors , the officials said .
Attorney General Janet Reno has approved the request and forwarded it to the White House , they said .
The government-wide overhaul also includes reviews by the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency , which officials expect will also lead to some organizational changes .
The overhaul is a tacit acknowledgment that the government has failed to keep pace with new forms of espionage .
The United States not only faces efforts to steal military secrets , but also economic espionage aimed at stealing technology or getting information that would help one country 's goods compete against another 's .
The espionage is not only conducted by foreign governments and military intelligence services , but also corporations .
The overhaul represents the first time the three agencies have systematically attempted to jointly assess espionage threats .
The FBI and other agencies separately conducted counterespionage programs during the Cold War , but those operations have dwindled since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 .
A new division of the FBI devoted solely to counterintelligence would add agents and analysts to the efforts against foreign espionage , reflecting the rapidly changing climate of global threats against American interests .
As part of the broader review , the FBI is likely to change its traditional system of assessing threats and allocating budgets on a country-by-country basis , officials said .
That system , known at the National Security Threat List , is likely to be scrapped , the officials said .
Instead , it would probably be replaced by a more sophisticated system that would take also assess threats from corporations and even international criminal organizations .
At the Pentagon , the review will focus on threats to the military and to the thousands of contractors , academics and research laboratories that work with the agency , said Kenneth Bacon , the Defense Department spokesman .
`` The review will analyze the threat and determine whether our response is adequate , '' he said .
At the CIA , officials said that only preliminary discussions have been held to review counterintelligence operations .
George J. Tenet , the director of central intelligence , and Freeh testified on Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the reorganization review .
In a separate review , the government is also changing procedures at the country 's nuclear weapons laboratories .
Those changes , including special squads of agents at the nuclear labs , were first reported in The Los Angeles Times and are being handled by officials at the FBI and the Energy Department .
The reorganization plan is a reaction to criticism of the government 's handling of suspected Chinese espionage at the labs .
Some lawmakers said the FBI and the Justice Department failed to aggressively investigate possible instances of Chinese espionage , including cases like that of Wen Ho Lee , the nuclear scientist suspected of helping the Chinese acquire advance thermonuclear technology .
Lee has denied that he ever spied for China .
Chinese officials have denied stealing nuclear secrets .
FBI officials said that the Lee case shows how hard it is to fight new espionage techniques , which involve informal contacts between scientists working in exotic disciplines that are often hard to ferret out and evaluate .
Some law enforcement officials have said that the increasing focus on counterterrorism cases , including both domestic and international investigations , had drawn attention of senior managers away from ongoing and often unglamorous counterintelligence work of keeping track of foreign visitors and Americans traveling abroad .
Reorganizing counterintelligence operations represents the latest step in the long and often troubled relationship between the agencies primarily responsible for catching spies , the FBI and the CIA .
Throughout most of the Cold War , the agencies were often at odds over counterintelligence policy , jealously guarding their turf .
FBI agents and CIA officers recruited their own informants and often refused to share leads and information about potential cases .
At times , the counterspy operations seemed to spin out of control .
James J. Angleton , the counterintelligence chief at the CIA , conducted zealous hunts for suspected moles at the agency , an effort that threatened to bring the agency to a standstill and ruined the careers of loyal agency employees .
Efforts at cooperation in the 1980s culminated with the successful prosecution of Aldrich H. Ames , the CIA officer who in 1993 pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow after an investigation concluded that he had turned over to the Russians the identities of more than a dozen Eastern bloc officials who were spying for the United States .
After the Ames case , a shattering experience for the CIA , new rules were adopted to require the agency to report possible security breaches to the FBI .
The two agencies have exchanged personnel to work on counterintelligence matters and Freeh and Tenet have sought to forge a better relationship .
Specific events have helped , like the FBI 's arrest in 1997 of Mir Amal Kansi , the gunman arrested in Pakistan , who was returned to the United States and convicted of killing two people in 1993 outside CIA headquarters .
