HAMBURG , Germany
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Australia and New Zealand went before an international tribunal Wednesday to try to freeze Japan 's experimental bluefin tuna fishing program .
The case before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea aims to secure a temporary injunction halting the program .
A verdict is expected next week .
Australian attorney-general Daryl Williams rejected Japan 's argument that the catches were needed for scientific purposes .
`` That excuse cannot prevail , '' he said , presenting his country 's case as the three-day hearing opened .
`` Japan is endangering the stock of southern bluefin tuna . ''
In a statement distributed at the hearing , the Japanese government challenged charges by Australia and New Zealand and offered to hold talks on catch quotas for the prized fish .
The three countries agreed on quotas for bluefins in 1985 .
Japan started experimental fishing after failing to win a higher quota in 1995 .
The Hamburg -based tribunal rules in disputes between countries that have joined the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea .
Williams said the tuna issue -- only the second case before the tribunal -- was a test of its ability to resolve fishing disputes .
The tribunal is expected to announce a verdict next week .
