CARACAS , Venezuela
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Cuba 's ambassador to Venezuela charged Friday that a group in Miami is working behind the scenes to encourage Cuban doctors on a disaster relief mission to defect .
The ambassador , German Sanchez , said at a press conference that the Miami -based Cuban American National Foundation has funneled money to Cuban exile groups in Venezuela who are urging Cuban doctors in the South American country to remain there .
`` We are in the presence of an action directed with evil intentions by certain persons with a large amount of money that comes from Miami , '' Sanchez said .
`` This money comes from the Cuban American National Foundation . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Sanchez charged that the plan was part of an effort by the group to create tensions between Venezuela and Cuba , whose presidents , Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro , are close allies .</ENAMEX>
Mariela Ferretti , a spokeswoman for the foundation , denied it had anything to do with recent defections by doctors and said they were simply cases of Cubans fleeing political repression on the island .
`` Apparently Castro has an obsession with the Cuban American National Foundation .
He points a finger at us every time something goes wrong for him , '' she said .
`` There 's no question this is an embarrassment for him . ''
Three Cuban doctors have requested political asylum in Venezuela in the past two weeks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The request by the first two was denied by Venezuelan authorities , who said the doctors did not face political persecution in Cuba and wanted to emigrate for economic reasons .
However , Venezuela said it would allow them to stay in the country for one year for unspecified `` humanitarian reasons . ''</ENAMEX>
On Friday , Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel announced that the same decision had been made for the third doctor , who requested asylum this week .
The doctor , Gliselia Alonso , said she wanted to leave Cuba because she had suffered discrimination there since she is not a fervent supporter of the Castro government .
She said that now that she had publicly requested political asylum , she would almost certainly face harassment or prison if she returned to Cuba .
`` I 'm risking my life , '' she told reporters .
Sanchez criticized the doctors , saying they were `` disloyal '' and lacked ethics since they had deserted their mission of helping victims of landslides that killed thousands of people in December .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The request for political asylum has presented a delicate political problem for Chavez , who often praises the 40-year -old Cuban revolution .</ENAMEX>
Sanchez said that the alleged efforts by the Cuban exile group in Miami to divide Cuba and Venezuela would fail .
He said about 450 Cuban medical personnel had been sent to Venezuela to assist in the relief efforts .
Most are still in the country with the Cuban government 's approval .
