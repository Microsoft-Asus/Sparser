TEHRAN , January 17 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iran confiscated a total of 235 tons of various narcotics in 1999 , Iranian Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi announced on Monday .
Speaking at the opening session of the First International Conference of Drug Liaison Officers , Hashemi said 740 drug traffickers were killed in the year , but Iran also lost 183 policemen in fighting against drug trafficking .
The large number of casualties has indicated how important it is to carry out anti-drug operations in Iran , the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying .
Blaming the growing output of poppy crops in Afghanistan , the Iranian official said that an intensified campaign on the Iranian northeastern borders has now channeled the trafficking activities to southern Iran .

The Iranian operations to intercept convoys of drugs will help the European countries save their population , he added .
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from Afghanistan , the world 's largest opium producer , and neighboring Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states .
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Iranian Majlis or parliament passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital punishment for drug traffickers .
A commander of the Iranian security forces said last November that the country has spent one billion U.S. dollars on combating drug trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979 .
The representative of the United Nations Drug Control Program -LRB- UNDCP -RRB- in Iran Antonio Mazzitelli expressed hope that the conference will prepare the ground for extensive international cooperation to fight against drugs .
The interception of any kilogram of drugs in Iran prevents distribution of thousands of doses of heroin in other countries , he said .
Representatives from Britain , Belgium , France , Australia , Italy , Canada , the United Arab Emirates and Norway as well as the Economic Cooperation Organization attended the three-day conference sponsored by UNDCP .
