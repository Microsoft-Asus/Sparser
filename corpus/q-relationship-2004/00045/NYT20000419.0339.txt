BOSTON --
A member of the Russian Parliament who had been repeatedly denied visas to enter the United States because of alleged ties to organized crime was granted approval by the State Department last week to attend a program at Harvard University 's John F. Kennedy School of Government .
Josef Kobzon is one of 24 Parliament members who arrived in Cambridge to attend a two-week program run by the Kennedy School to instruct them on American government and politics .
Kobzon could not be reached for comment but , according to the faculty director of the program , Kobzon intends to drop out of the program Thursday and return to Moscow .
Kobzon gave no reason for leaving early , said David C. King , a professor at the Kennedy School and the program 's faculty director .
King said he was unaware of Kobzon 's background until questioned by the Globe about Kobzon 's participation in the program .
King said Harvard played no role in seeking the visas for Kobzon and other Parliament members , and that the request had been made by the Russian government to the US Embassy in Moscow .
A State Department official , who asked not to be identified , said late Wednesday that as a member of the Duma , or lower house of Parliament , Kobzon would have been afforded special consideration for a visa this time since he was requesting it as an official member of the Russian government and it was to allow him to participate in a formal educational program .
A popular singer by profession and known as the Frank Sinatra of Russia , Kobzon is a close political ally of Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov .
A `` 60 Minutes '' program on Luzhkov in October 1998 reported that the CIA identified Kobzon as the czar of the Russian mafia and said that members of the Yeltsin government had urged Luzhkov to distance himself from Kobzon .
The report also said the State Department had denied a visa for at least the prior three years on grounds he might engage in criminal activity in the United States .
US law enforcement sources called Kobzon an `` intermediary '' for organized crime groups in Russia , according to `` 60 Minutes . ''
Kobzon denied any such links to organized crime .
While King called Kobzon an `` exemplary '' participant in the Kennedy School program , Marshall Goldman of Harvard 's Davis Center for Russian Studies said it was `` embarrassing '' to have Kobzon involved .
`` It is well-known in Russia that he has been denied visas because of his background , '' Goldman said .
`` He should n't be here just because he is a Duma member . ''
