Pacific salmon, for example, hatch in the headwaters of a stream, then migrate to open ocean, where they require one to four years to mature. They eventually return to freshwater streams to spawn, producing thousands of small eggs in a single reproductive opportunity, and then they die. Ecologists call this <span class="Emphasis2">big-bang reproduction.</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.4</span> illustrates big-bang reproduction in agaves. The agave, or century plant, grows in arid climates with sparse and unpredictable rainfall. Agaves grow vegetatively for several years, then send up a large flowering stalk, produce seeds, and die. (We introduced the big-bang reproduction of century plants on the opening page of Chapter 38.) The shallow roots of agaves catch water after rain showers but are dry during droughts. This unpredictable water supply may prevent seed production or seedling establishment for several years at a time. By growing and storing nutrients until an unusually wet year and then putting all its resources into reproduction, the agave’s big-bang strategy is a life history adaptation to erratic climate. In another example of big-bang reproduction, annual desert wildflowers generally germinate, grow, produce many small seeds, and then die, all in the span of a month after spring rains. Big-bang (one-time) reproduction is also called <span class="Emphasis2">semelparity</span> (from the Latin <span class="Emphasis1">semel</span>, once, and <span class="Emphasis1">parito</span>, to beget).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig52-4','../fig/big/fig52-4.jpg','fig52-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig52-4.jpg" alt="fig52-4" name="myfig52-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 52-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">An example of big-bang reproduction.</span> Agaves, or century plants, grow without reproducing for several years and then produce a gigantic flowering stalk and many seeds.

And some species of oaks do not reproduce until the tree is 20 years old, but then produce vast numbers of large seeds each year for a century or more.

That is, how much will an individual gain in reproductive success through one strategy versus the other? The key demographic effect of big-bang reproduction is higher reproductive rates. Plants like agaves that reproduce only once typically produce two to five times as many seeds as closely related species that reproduce repeatedly. The critical factor in the evolutionary dilemma of big-bang versus repeated reproduction is the survival rate of the offspring. If their chance of survival is poor or inconsistent, repeated reproduction will be favored.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
