 Eukaryotic life began by 2.1 billion years ago

Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and much more complex than prokaryotic cells (see Chapter 7). In Chapter 28, we'll examine evidence that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotes living within larger prokaryotic cells. The mitochondria of our cells and those of all other eukaryotes are descendants of some of those "endosymbionts" (symbiotic cells living within larger host cells). And so are the chloroplasts of plants and algae.

The oldest putative fossils of eukaryotes are 2.2-billion-year-old corkscrew-shaped organisms that look like relatively simple single-celled algae. The oldest fossils that are large enough to be eukaryotic to the satisfaction of most researchers are only about 2.1 billion years old. However, some researchers postulate a much earlier eukaryotic origin based on certain chemical traces dating back 2.7 billion years. This range of vintages places the earliest eukaryotes during a time when the oxygen revolution was changing Earth's environments dramatically. Chloroplasts may be part of the explanation for this temporal correlation. And another eukaryotic organelle, the mitochondrion, turned the accumulating O2 to metabolic advantage through the process of cellular respiration.
