Therefore, the cladogram in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.1</span> nests the vertebrate clade within a larger clade, <span class="Emphasis2">Craniata,</span> which is named for the cranium and includes the hagfishes. However, we will include hagfishes in our survey of vertebrates, with the caveat that they represent an ancient branch of Craniata that predates the origin of the vertebral column.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The cranium and vertebral column, surrounding and protecting the nerve cord, are parts of the vertebrate axial skeleton, the main support structure for the axis, or central trunk, of the body. The axial skeleton helps make large body size and strong, fast movement possible. The axial skeleton of most vertebrates also includes ribs, which anchor muscles and protect internal organs. Most vertebrates also have an appendicular skeleton, supporting two pairs of appendages (fins, legs, or arms).</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The vertebrate endoskeleton is made of bone or more flexible cartilage, or most commonly some combination of these two materials. Although the skeleton consists mostly of a nonliving matrix, living cells within the skeleton secrete and maintain the materials of the matrix. The endoskeleton of a vertebrate can grow with the animal, unlike the nonliving exoskeleton of arthropods, which must be periodically shed and rebuilt as the animal grows.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">When vertebrates move in pursuit of food or when escaping predators, they regenerate their ATP supply mainly by cellular respiration, which consumes oxygen. Adaptations of the vertebrate respiratory and circulatory systems support busy mitochondria in muscle cells and other active tissues. Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system, with a ventral, chambered heart that pumps blood through arteries to microscopic vessels called capillaries that branch throughout every tissue in the body. The blood is oxygenated as it passes through capillaries in gills or lungs.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">A vigorous lifestyle also requires a relatively large supply of organic fuel. Vertebrate adaptations for feeding, digestion, and nutrient absorption help support active behavior. For example, muscles in the walls of the digestive tract propel food from organ to organ along the tract. These are all examples of vertebrate form and function having their historical basis in the transition from a relatively sedentary lifestyle to a more active one.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
