TIRANA , Albania --
The Albanian secret police , under the direction of U.S. intelligence operatives , combed this ramshackle Balkan country Friday for Islamic terrorists suspected of using charity organizations as a cover for their operations .
A series of raids orchestrated by the CIA this summer against Islamic militants apparently thwarted a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy and broke up a cell of Muslim fundamentalists who were wanted in Egypt .
But many suspected terrorists sought by the Albanian police apparently have fled this country , where border controls and internal policing are virtually nonexistent .
Among the wanted individuals is the director of the Islamic Revival Foundation .
The foundation is one of scores of Islamic charities , many of them fundamentalist , from Saudi Arabia , Egypt and other Arab countries that have sprung up here in recent years as Albania emerged from decades of Stalinist isolation .
At the foundation 's headquarters , located behind rust-colored metal gates in an alley in an eastern district of the city , a request for an interview was rebuffed .
But workers confirmed that the director was long gone .
An auto mechanic working across the street from the headquarters recalled a three-hour police raid late in the afternoon of June 28 .
He remembered that four Fiat Panda cars carrying plainclothes policemen arrived , and that the policemen , who carried rifles and walkie-talkies , took away one Arab foreigner , some computers and other material .
They had also raided a nearby apartment where an Arab had been living , he said , but the apartment was empty .
CIA analysts suspect that the foundation may be one of many fronts for the far-flung operations of Osama bin Laden , the Saudi Arabian multi-millionaire and alleged terrorist who is suspected of organizing the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania from his base in Afghanistan .
Post - Communist Albania officially embraced Islam and became the only country in Europe to join the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
Islamic charities have built much-needed hospitals and schools , often in remote villages , under the condition that they also build mosques .
Western intelligence officials believe that some of those organizations also provided cover for Islamic terrorists .
The intelligence officials are especially interested in the Kuwait Joint Relief Committee , which they believe channeled funds into the Islamic Revival Foundation and other Islamic activities here .
Three of the Egyptians arrested here and extradited to Cairo earlier this summer were believed to be linked to the 1997 massacre of tourists at Luxor , Egypt , in which 62 people were killed , Albanian Interior Ministry officials said .
Two of the men had been sentenced to death in Cairo for Islamic Jihad activities , including a 1993 assassination attempt against former Prime Minister Atef Sedki .
Anarchy has existed in Albania since March 1997 , when a wildly popular financial pyramid scheme collapsed .
The collapse forced much of the population into bankruptcy , and the government collapsed during the ensuing unrest .
The army could not control widespread looting , including the looting of its own weapons depots .
The Interior Ministry concedes that several provinces in the mountainous north of the country are outside the sway of the government and that the only customs control -- and even that is tenuous -- is at the airport near here .
Otherwise , government officials concede , the borders are wide open .
Over the last year , a Western diplomat said , Albania has seen a striking rise in organized crime and become a center for the smuggling of immigrants from Kurdistan , Pakistan , China , the Philippines and other impoverished countries .
The immigrants gain easy entry to Albania and then seek passage to Italy on ferries or small boats .
