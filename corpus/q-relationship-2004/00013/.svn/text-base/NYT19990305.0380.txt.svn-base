Samore assembled the competing teams of CIA and DOE analysts in mid- October for a meeting in his White House office that turned into a tense debate .
The CIA report noted that China and Russia were cooperating on nuclear issues , indicating that this was another possible explanation of Beijing 's improved warheads .
Trulock said this was a misreading of the evidence , which included intercepted communications between Russian and Chinese experts .
The Russians were offering advice on how to measure the success of nuclear tests , not design secrets .
In fact , Trulock argued , the Russian measurement techniques were used to help the Chinese analyze the performance of a weapon that Los Alamos experts believed was based on a U.S. design .
`` At the meeting , Notra Trulock said that he thought the CIA was underplaying the effect that successful Chinese espionage operations in the weapons labs had had on the Chinese nuclear weapons program , '' said one official .
Relying on the CIA report , Samore told Berger in late September that the picture was less conclusive than Trulock was arguing .
Officials said he began to relay that view before hearing Trulock 's rebuttal of the CIA study at the October meeting .
Samore told Berger `` there is n't enough information to resolve the debate , there is no definitive answer , but in any event this clearly illustrates weaknesses in DOE 's counterintelligence capability , '' said one official familiar with Samore 's presentation .
CIA officials strenuously deny that the agency 's analysts intended to downplay Trulock 's findings .
The FBI inquiry was stalled .
At a September 1997 meeting between FBI and Energy Department officials , Freeh concluded that the bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest the suspect , according to officials .
The crime was believed to have occurred more than a decade earlier .
Investigators did not then have sufficient evidence to obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect , making it difficult to build a strong criminal case , according to U.S. officials .
FBI officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the former Soviet Union .
But even if the bureau could n't build a case , the Energy Department could still take some action against someone holding a U.S. security clearance .
Freeh told DOE officials that there was no longer an investigative reason to allow the suspect to remain in his sensitive position , officials said .
In espionage cases , the FBI often wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of tipping them off prematurely .
But the suspect was allowed to keep his job and retain his security clearances for more than a year after the meeting with Freeh , according to U.S. officials .
In late 1997 , the NSC did begin to draft a new counterintelligence plan for the weapons labs , and Clinton signed the order mandating the new measures in February 1998 .
In April , a former FBI counterintelligence agent , Ed Curran , was named to run a more vigorous counterintelligence office at Energy Department headquarters .
The administration explained aspects of the case to aides working for the House and Senate intelligence committees beginning in 1996 .
But few in Congress grasped the magnitude of what had happened .
In July 1998 , the House Intelligence Committee requested an update on the case , officials said .
Trulock forwarded the request in a memo to , and in conversations with , Elizabeth Moler , then acting energy secretary .
Ms. Moler ordered him not to brief the House panel for fear that the information would be used to attack the president 's China policy , according to an account he later gave congressional investigators .
Ms. Moler , now a Washington lawyer , says she does not remember the request to allow Trulock to brief Congress and denies delaying the process .
In October , Ms. Moler , then deputy secretary , stopped Trulock from delivering written testimony on espionage activities in the labs to a closed session of the House National Security Committee .
Ms. Moler told Trulock to rewrite his testimony to limit it to the announced subject of the hearing , foreign visitors to the labs , an Energy Department spokeswoman said .
The issue came up nonetheless when committee members asked follow-up questions , Energy Department officials said .
Key lawmakers began to learn about the extent of the Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear secrets late in 1998 , when a select committee investigating the transfers of sensitive U.S. technology to China , chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox , R - Calif. , heard from Trulock .
Administration officials say that Congress was adequately informed , but leading Democrats and Republicans disagree .
Rep. Norman Dicks , D - Wash. , the ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee and also a member of the Cox committee , said that he and Rep. Porter Goss , R - Fla. , chairman of the House intelligence panel , were not adequately informed .
