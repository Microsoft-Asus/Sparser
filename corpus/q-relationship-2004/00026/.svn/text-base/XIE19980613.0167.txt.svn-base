SANTIAGO , June 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chilean environmentalists have expressed concern over an eventual fall of the Russian space station Mir in Chilean territory .
The environmentalists have asked the government to demand the postponement of the maneuver which will pull the space station out of its orbit , the Chilean press reported Friday .
The members of the Political Ecology Institute of Chile said that the maneuver to drop the space station to Earth could be started before complete information about the Mir components was obtained .
It had to be known whether the structure contained substances dangerous to the population and the environment in general , they said .
The Russian authorities have decided to abandon the Mir station because of a lack of resources to keep it in orbit .
Although it is not possible to forecast specifically where the Mir would fall , there was a possibility of it hitting Chilean territory .
However , Chilean consul in Moscow Alejandro Gibbons rejected the possibility of serious damage in Chilean territory caused by an eventual fall of the 130 ton station , because , in his opinion , it would disintegrate before hitting the ground .
