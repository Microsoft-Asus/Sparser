BONN , June 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Germany is holding its tough stance in the `` mad cow '' dispute and will continue to ban beef imports from Britain , according to a published report today .
Despite the European Union 's -LRB- EU -RRB- recent move to ease its ban on British beef , the German government wo n't drop its opposition , Health Minister Horst Seehofer told Bild - Zeitung am Sonntag .
The decision , he said , is based on research results that `` mad cow '' disease , formally known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- , could have potentials to infect humans .
A change in the German position is possible only if measures currently adopted by the British government proved to be effective in curbing the disease 's spread , the minister added .
Before any scientific evidence that could defy the disease 's threat comes in , Seehofer asserted , it 's necessary to `` give priorities to human health and consumer interest . ''
As the first step to lift an overall ban , the EU Commission agreed on June 5 in Brussels to allow the exports of three British beef by-products -- gelatine , tallow and bull semen .
However , five of the EU 's 15 member nations , including Germany , which was the main force against lifting the ban , voted against the decision and refused to carry it out .
Scientists found BSE , which reached epidemic proportions in the late 1980s , was caused by feeding cattle the remains of sheep that had been infected with scrapie , their own version of the disease .
The disease reportedly continues to infect British herds despite a government ban on using feed containing animal protein .
It was the fear of its possible human infection that prompted the EU to ban Britain 's beef exports on March 27 -- a measure that has caused tensions in Britain 's relations with other EU nations .
