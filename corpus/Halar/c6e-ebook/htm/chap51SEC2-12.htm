In a narrow sense, it is synonymous with consciousness, or awareness. In a broad sense--the way we use the term in this book--<span class="Emphasis2">cognition</span> is the ability of an animal’s nervous system to perceive, store, process, and use information gathered by sensory receptors. The study of animal cognition, called <span class="Emphasis2">cognitive ethology,</span> examines the connection between an animal’s nervous system and its behavior. Cognitive ethology includes, but is not limited to, the study of animal consciousness, or awareness.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">One area of research in cognitive ethology investigates how an animal’s brain represents physical stimuli from the environment. For instance, what kind of calculations, if any, does the brain of a dog make about where a Frisbee will land? What is the nature of the dog’s internal representation of the spatial relationships between the spinning Frisbee and other objects in the immediate environment? Questions such as these, concerned with internal representations of an animal’s physical surroundings, are separate and distinct from questions about consciousness.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
