THE ORIGIN OF LIFE

 

 The first cells may have originated by chemical evolution on a young Earth:an overview



 

 Abiotic synthesis of organic monomers is a testable hypothesis



 

 Laboratory simulations of early-Earth conditions have produced organic polymers



 

 RNA may have been the first genetic material



 

 Protobionts can form by self-assembly



 

 Natural selection could refine protobionts containing hereditary information



 

 Debate about the origin of life abounds



The question of how life began is more specifically about the genesis of prokaryotes. Sometime between about 4.0 billion years ago, when Earth's crust began to solidify, and 3.5 billion years ago, when the planet was inhabited by bacteria advanced enough to build stromatolites, the first organisms came into being. What was their origin? We will never know for sure, of course, how life on Earth began. But science seeks natural causes for natural phenomena, and that is the approach that must guide scientific inquiry about the origin of life
