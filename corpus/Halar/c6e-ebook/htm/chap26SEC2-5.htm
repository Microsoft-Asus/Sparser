A great range of unicellular forms evolved, giving rise to a diversity of protists, and their single-celled descendants, that continue to flourish today. But multicellular forms also evolved. Their descendants include a variety of multicellular algae, plants, fungi, and animals. A multicellular organism, such as an animal, generally develops from a single cell--the fertilized egg, or zygote, in the case of sexual reproduction (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.4</span>). Cell division and cell differentiation help transform the single cell to a multicellular adult with many types of specialized cells.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Molecular clocks date the common ancestor of multicellular eukaryotes back to 1.5 billion years ago. However, the oldest known fossils of multicellular eukaryotes are of relatively small algae that lived about 1.2 billion years ago (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.6</span>). Larger organisms, including animals such as jellies ("jellyfishes") and worms, do not appear in the fossil record until several hundred million years later, in the late Precambrian era about 600 million years ago (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.1</span>). Chinese paleontologists recently described a particularly rich fossil site 570 million years old containing a diversity of algae and animals, including some beautifully preserved embryos (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 26.7</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig26-6','../fig/big/fig26-6.jpg','fig26-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig26-6.jpg" alt="fig26-6" name="myfig26-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 26-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Fossilized alga about 1.2 billion years old.</span> Such fossils are the earliest evidence of organisms with more than one type of cell.

This <span class="Emphasis2">snowball Earth</span> hypothesis is based partly on geologic clues that glaciers covered the planet’s landmasses from pole to pole. The seas also would have been iced over. Thus, most life would have been confined to areas near deep-sea vents and hot springs or to those sparse locales where enough ice melted for sunlight to penetrate the surface waters of the seas. According to this hypothesis, the fossil record for the first major diversification of multicellular eukaryotes corresponds in time to the thawing of snowball Earth. A second radiation of eukaryotic forms produced most of the major groups of animals during the early Cambrian period, the first period of the Paleozoic era.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
