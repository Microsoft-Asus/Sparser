Science is a way of knowing. It emerges from our curiosity about ourselves, the world, and the universe. Striving to understand seems to be one of our basic drives. At the heart of science are people asking questions about nature and believing that those questions are answerable. Scientists tend to be quite passionate in their quest for discovery. Max Perutz, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, put it this way: "A discovery is like falling in love and reaching the top of a mountain after a hard climb all in one, an ecstasy induced not by drugs but by the revelation of a face of nature that no one has seen before."</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The process of science blends two main types of exploration: discovery science and hypothetico-deductive science. Most scientists practice a combination of these two forms of inquiry.</p><p class="Header3">Discovery Science and Induction</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Science seeks natural causes for natural phenomena. This limits the scope of science to the study of structures and processes that we can observe and measure, either directly or indirectly with the help of tools such as microscopes that extend our senses. This dependence on observations that other people can confirm demystifies nature and distinguishes science from supernatural explanations. Science can neither prove nor disprove that angels, ghosts, deities, or spirits, both benevolent and evil, cause storms, rainbows, illnesses, and cures, for such explanations are outside the bounds of science.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Verifiable observations and measurements are the data of discovery science (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.18</span>). In our quest to describe nature accurately, we discover its structure and behavior. In biology, discovery science enables us to describe life at its many levels, from ecosystems down to cells and molecules. A naturalist’s careful description of diverse plants and animals is an example of discovery science, sometimes called descriptive science. A more recent example is the sequencing of the human genome; it’s not really a set of experiments, but a detailed dissection and description of the genetic material.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig1-18','../fig/big/fig1-18.jpg','fig1-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig1-18.jpg" alt="fig1-18" name="myfig1-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 1-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Careful observation and measurement provide the raw data for science.</span> Cornell University’s Eloy Rodriguez collects a sample of chemicals extracted from a plant.

One of the most famous examples is Alexander Fleming’s 1928 discovery that certain fungi produce chemicals that kill bacteria. Fleming, a Scottish physician and microbiologist, was culturing bacteria in glass dishes in his laboratory. After finding that a mold (fungus) had contaminated some of his bacterial cultures, he was in the process of discarding the cultures when he noticed that no bacteria were growing in the vicinity of the mold. The fungus turned out to be a common bread mold named <span class="Emphasis1">Penicillium,</span> which produces an antibacterial chemical that was later named penicillin. Quite by accident, Fleming had made a discovery that led to the use of penicillin and other antibiotics to cure syphilis, meningitis, and many other diseases caused by bacteria.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Discovery science can lead to important conclusions based on a type of logic called inductive reasoning. An inductive conclusion is a generalization that summarizes many concurrent observations. "All organisms are made of cells" is an example. That induction was based on two centuries of biologists discovering cells in every biological specimen they observed with microscopes. The careful observations of discovery science and the inductive conclusions they sometimes produce are fundamental to our understanding of nature.</p><p class="Header3">Hypothetico-Deductive Science</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The observations of discovery science engage inquisitive minds to ask questions and seek explanations. Ideally, such investigation consists of what is called the scientific method. As a formal process of inquiry, the scientific method consists of a series of steps, but few scientists adhere rigidly to this prescription (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.19</span>). Science is a less structured process than most people realize. Although it would be misleading to reduce science to a stereotyped method, we <span class="Emphasis1">can</span> identify the key element of the method. It is called hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The "hypothetico" refers to what scientists call hypotheses.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig1-19','../fig/big/fig1-19.jpg','fig1-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig1-19.jpg" alt="fig1-19" name="myfig1-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 1-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Idealized version of the scientific method.</span> Although science rarely conforms exactly to this protocol of steps, inquiry usually involves posing and testing hypotheses.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">A hypothesis is a tentative answer to some question--an explanation on trial. It is usually an educated guess. We all use hypotheses in solving everyday problems. Let’s say, for example, that your flashlight fails during a camp-out. That’s an observation. The question is obvious: Why doesn’t the flashlight work? A reasonable hypothesis based on past experience is that the batteries in the flashlight are dead.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">"If &#160;...&#160; then"</span> Logic.</span> The <span class="Emphasis1">deductive</span> in hypothetico-deductive reasoning refers to the use of deductive logic to test hypotheses. Deduction differs from induction, which, remember, is reasoning from a set of specific observations to reach a general conclusion. In deduction, the reasoning flows in the opposite direction, from the general to the specific. From general premises, we extrapolate to the specific results we should expect if the premises are true. If all organisms are made of cells (premise 1) and humans are organisms (premise 2), then humans are composed of cells (deductive prediction about a specific case).</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">In the process of science, the deduction usually takes the form of predictions about what outcomes of experiments or observations we should expect if a particular hypothesis (premise) is correct. We then test the hypothesis by performing the experiment to see whether or not the results are as predicted. This deductive testing takes the form of "<span class="Emphasis1">If</span>&#160;...&#160;<span class="Emphasis1">then</span>" logic:</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="ExtractText">OBSERVATION: My flashlight doesn’t work.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="ExtractText">QUESTION: What’s wrong with my flashlight?</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="ExtractText">HYPOTHESIS: The flashlight’s batteries are dead.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="ExtractText">PREDICTION: <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">If</span></span> this hypothesis is correct</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="ExtractText">EXPERIMENT: and I replace the batteries with new ones,</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="ExtractText">PREDICTED RESULT: <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">then</span></span> the flashlight should work.</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s say the flashlight <span class="Emphasis1">still</span> doesn’t work.

For many years, David Reznick of the University of California, Riverside, and John Endler of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have been investigating differences between populations of guppies in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. Guppies <span class="Emphasis1">(Poecilia reticulata)</span> are small freshwater fishes you probably recognize as common aquarium pets. In the Aripo River system of Trinidad, guppies live in small pools as populations that are relatively isolated from one another. In some cases, two populations inhabiting the same stream live less than 100 m (meters) apart, but they are separated by a waterfall that impedes the migration of guppies between the two pools.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText">When Reznick and Endler compared guppy populations, they observed differences in what are called <span class="Emphasis1">life history characteristics.</span> These characteristics included the average age and size of guppies when they reach sexual maturity and begin to reproduce. The researchers were able to correlate variations in these life history characteristics with the types of predators present in different locations. In some pools, the main predator is a small fish called a killifish, which preys predominantly on small, juvenile guppies. In other locations, a larger predator called a pike-cichlid preys more intensely on guppies and mainly eats relatively large, sexually mature individuals. Guppies in populations exposed to these pike-cichlids reproduce at a younger age and are smaller at maturity, on average, than guppies that coexist with killifish.</p><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText">What causes these life history differences between the guppy populations? Correlation with the type of predator present is suggestive, but a correlation does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. The type of predator present and the life history characteristics of the guppy populations in a particular location may be independent consequences of some third factor. In fact, Reznick and Endler tested the hypothesis that the life history variations were due to differences in water temperature or other features of the physical environment. Notice the <span class="Emphasis1">"If&#160;...&#160; then"</span> logic characteristic of the hypothetico-deductive approach.</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="ExtractText">HYPOTHESIS #1: <span class="Emphasis2">If</span> differences in physical environments cause variations in the life histories of guppy populations,</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="ExtractText">EXPERIMENT: and samples from different wild guppy populations are collected and maintained for several generations in identical environments in predator-free aquaria,</p><a name="para23"></a><p class="ExtractText">PREDICTED RESULT: <span class="Emphasis2">then</span> the laboratory populations should become more similar in their life history characteristics.</p><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText">When the researchers performed this experiment, the differences persisted for many generations. This result eliminates hypothesis #1 and also indicates that the life history differences in guppy populations are inherited. Based on the assumption that natural selection can lead to genetic differences in populations, Reznick and Endler tested the following explanation:</p><a name="para25"></a><p class="ExtractText">HYPOTHESIS #2: <span class="Emphasis2">If</span> the feeding preferences of different predators caused contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection,</p><a name="para26"></a><p class="ExtractText">EXPERIMENT: and guppies are transplanted from locations with pike-cichlids (predators of mature guppies) to guppy-free sites inhabited by killifish (predators of juvenile guppies),</p><a name="para27"></a><p class="ExtractText">PREDICTED RESULT: <span class="Emphasis2">then</span> the transplanted guppy populations should show a generation-to-generation trend toward later maturation and larger size--life history characteristics typical of natural guppy populations that coexist with killifish.</p><a name="para28"></a><p class="BlockText">Reznick and Endler introduced guppies from locations with pike-cichlids to sites that had killifish but no guppies (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.21</span>). Over a period of 11 years, the scientists compared the transplanted guppy populations with populations left in the pike-cichlid pools. The biologists measured such life history as age and size at maturity. To be certain that only heritable differences were counted, the scientists made their measurements after samples from the transplanted and non-transplanted guppy populations had been reared for two generations in identical aquarium environments. After 11 years, or 30 to 60 generations, the transplanted guppies had an average weight at maturity that was about 14%  greater than the guppies that were not transplanted to killifish pools. Other life history traits also changed in the direction predicted by the hypothesis that they type of predator affects the evolution of these traits in guppy populations (bar graphs in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.21</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig1-21','../fig/big/fig1-21.jpg','fig1-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig1-21.jpg" alt="fig1-21" name="myfig1-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 1-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Controlled experiments to test the hypothesis that selective predation affects the evolution of guppy populations</span>.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para29"></a><p class="BlockText">The experimental design in our case study is an example of what scientists call a <span class="Emphasis1">controlled experiment.</span> In a controlled experiment, comparisons are made between two sets of subjects--guppy populations, in this case. The set that receives the experimental treatment is called the <span class="Emphasis1">experimental group.</span> In our example, the experimental group consisted of the guppies that Reznick and Endler transplanted from pike-cichlid pools to killifish pools. In contrast, the <span class="Emphasis1">control group</span>--the guppies that remained in the pike-cichlid pools, in this case--does not receive the experimental treatment. Ideally, the experimental treatment is the only difference between the experimental group and the control group. Such a controlled experiment enables researchers to focus on responses to a single variable--a change of predator in the guppy experiments.</p><a name="para30"></a><p class="BlockText">Without a control group for comparison, there would be no way to tell whether it was the killifish or some <span class="Emphasis1">other</span> factor that caused the transplanted guppy populations to change. But because control sites and experimental sites were often nearby pools of the same stream, the main variable was probably the different predators. And the researchers observed similar results when guppies were reared in artificial streams that were identical except for the type of predator.</p><a name="para31"></a><p class="BlockText">Of the several hypotheses Reznick and Endler have tested (we examined only two), they are left with natural selection due to differential predation on larger versus smaller guppies as the most likely explanation for the observed differences between guppy populations. Apparently, when predators such as pike-cichlids prey mainly on reproductively mature adults, the chance that a guppy will survive to reproduce several times is relatively low. The guppies with greatest reproductive success should then be the individuals that mature at a young age and small size and produce at least one brood before growing to a size preferred by the local predator. The controlled experiments of Reznick and Endler documented evolution in a natural setting over a relatively short time (within only 11 years in the study we have followed).</p><a name="para32"></a><p class="BlockText">Our case study reinforces the important point that scientific hypotheses must be <span class="Emphasis1">testable.</span> Without such testing, ideas about nature, such as speculations on size differences in guppies, are "just so" stories. And explaining that something is true because "it’s just so" is not very convincing.</p><p class="Header3">Theories in Science</p><a name="para33"></a><p class="BlockText">Many people associate facts with science, but accumulating facts is not what science is primarily about. A telephone book is an impressive catalog of factual information, but it has little to do with science. It is true that facts, in the form of verifiable observations and repeatable experimental results, are the prerequisites of science. What really advances science, however, is some new theory that ties together a number of observations and experimental results that previously seemed unrelated. The cornerstones of science are the explanations that apply to the greatest variety of phenomena. People like Newton, Darwin, and Einstein stand out in the history of science not because they discovered a great many facts, but because their theories had such broad explanatory power.</p><a name="para34"></a><p class="BlockText">What is a scientific theory, and how is it different from a hypothesis? Compared with a hypothesis, a theory is much broader in scope. This is a hypothesis: "Feeding preferences of different predators cause contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection." But <span class="Emphasis1">this</span> is a theory: "Populations can evolve by natural selection because of feeding preferences of predators."</p><a name="para35"></a><p class="BlockText">Because theories are so comprehensive, they only become widely accepted in science if they are supported by an accumulation of extensive and varied evidence. This use of the term <span class="Emphasis1">theory</span> in science for a comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence contrasts with our everyday usage, which equates theories more with speculations or hypotheses. Natural selection qualifies as a scientific theory because of its broad application and because it has been validated by a continuum of observations and experiments. (You will find many examples in Units Four and Eight of this textbook.)</p><a name="para36"></a><p class="BlockText">Scientific theories are not the only way of "knowing nature," of course. A comparative religion course would be an excellent opportunity to learn about the diverse legends that tell of a supernatural creation of Earth and its life. Science and religion are two very different ways of trying to make sense of nature. Art is still another way. A broad education should include exposure to these different ways of viewing nature. Each of us synthesizes our worldview by integrating our life experiences and multidisciplinary education. As a science textbook that is part of that broad education, <span class="Emphasis1">Biology</span> showcases life in the scientific context of evolution, the one theme that continues to hold all of biology together no matter how big and complex the subject becomes.</p><p class="Header3">Science as a Social Process</p><a name="para37"></a><p class="BlockText">The Hollywood image of the socially challenged scientist working alone in a secluded laboratory is as much a false stereotype as the idea that scientists always practice the scientific method in rigid lockstep. The reality is that science is an intensely social activity. Most scientists work in teams, and in academic environments the research groups often include both graduate and undergraduate students (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 1.22</span>). If you survey the table of contents of some scientific journals in your college library, you’ll find that the majority of articles are coauthored by teams of two or more scientists. And those journal articles make another point about the social nature of science: Research results are inert until shared with a broader community of peers.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig1-22','../fig/big/fig1-22.jpg','fig1-22');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig1-22.jpg" alt="fig1-22" name="myfig1-22"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 1-22.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Science as a social process.</span> Here, New York University plant biologist Gloria Coruzzi (left) mentors one of her students in the methods of molecular biology.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para38"></a><p class="BlockText">It is not unusual that several scientists are asking the same questions. Such convergence contributes to the progressive and self-correcting qualities of science. Scientists build on what has been learned from earlier research, and they pay close attention to contemporary scientists working in the same field. Scientists share information through publications, seminars, meetings, and personal communication. The Internet has added a new medium for this exchange of ideas and data.</p><a name="para39"></a><p class="BlockText">Both cooperation and competition characterize the scientific culture. Scientists working in the same research field subject one another’s work to careful scrutiny. It is common for scientists to check on each other’s claims by attempting to repeat experiments. This obsession with evidence and confirmation helps characterize the scientific style of inquiry. Scientists are generally skeptics.</p><a name="para40"></a><p class="BlockText">We have seen that science has two related features that distinguish it from other styles of inquiry: (1) a dependence on observations and measurements that others can verify and (2) the requirement that ideas (hypotheses and theories) are testable by observations and experiments that others can repeat.</p><a name="para41"></a><p class="BlockText">Throughout this book, you will find many examples of science in action, each marked by the icon that is shown on the right.</p><p class="Header3">The Cultural Context of Science</p><a name="para42"></a><p class="BlockText">The sociology of biology extends beyond the boundaries of the scientific community; science as a whole is embedded in the culture of its times. Just one example is the increasing proportion of women in biology and the impact they are having on the research being performed. A few decades ago, for instance, biologists who studied the mating behavior of animals focused most of their attention on competition among males for access to females. More recent research is revealing the role that females play in choosing mates. For example, in many bird species, females prefer the bright coloration that "advertises" a male’s vigorous health, a behavior that enhances the probability of having healthy offspring.</p><a name="para43"></a><p class="BlockText">Some philosophers of science argue that scientists are so influenced by cultural and political values that science is no more objective than other ways of "knowing nature." At the other extreme are people who speak of scientific theories as though they were natural laws instead of human interpretations of nature. The reality of science is probably somewhere in between. The cultural milieu affects scientific fashion, but the criterion of repeatability in observation and hypothesis testing still defines science as fundamentally different from other strategies of knowing nature. This distinction also contrasts the provisional status of science-based knowledge with unconditional beliefs based on faith. There are many examples of cherished hypotheses and even theories in science that were eventually remodeled or rejected in light of compelling new data. A hundred years ago, for instance, most biologists agreed that fungi and bacteria were types of plants. And there are also cases of entrenched theories that went unchallenged for too long because they fit so comfortably into the current cultural context or because there was a tendency to reject evidence that "rocked the boat." The theory of a geocentric (Earth-centered) universe is an example. But such historical examples of theories that persisted in science in spite of their incompatibility with an accumulation of repeatable measurements and experiments are relatively rare. If there is "truth" in science, it is based on a preponderance of the available evidence.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
