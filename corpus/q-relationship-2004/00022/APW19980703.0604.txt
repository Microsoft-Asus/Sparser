<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The U.N. 's top refugee official on Friday appealed to Guinea to give aid agencies access to some 150,000 Sierra Leonean refugees cut off for almost three weeks</ENAMEX> .
Aid deliveries have been barred from the area southwest of the town of Gueckedou , on Guinea 's border with Sierra Leone , with authorities citing security concerns .
In a letter to Guinea 's President Lansana Conte , U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata called for renewed access to the refugees on `` strictly humanitarian grounds . ''
`` The refugees ' situation is all the more preoccupying because they arrived in Guinea in very poor health , '' Ogata said .
Malnutrition and death rates , especially among young children , were already very high before food , water and medical care was cut off , UNHCR said in a statement .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Many of those crossing into Guinea in the last weeks had not received a first food ration when aid was blocked</ENAMEX> '' on June 15 , it added .
The decision halted work on clean water supplies and latrines , `` raising the risk of disease in dozens of sites . ''
Around 250,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled to neighboring Guinea and Liberia so far this year , UNHCR says .
In all , Guinea has some 300,000 refugees from years of fighting in Sierra Leone .
Thousands of villagers in Sierra Leone have lost limbs and others have been killed in attacks apparently being carried out by former junta troops seeking revenge for their ouster from the capital , Freetown , by a Nigerian -led West African force in February .
That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a bloody May 1997 coup .
