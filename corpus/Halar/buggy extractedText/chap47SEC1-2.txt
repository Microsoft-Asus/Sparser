THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BASIS OF MORPHOGENESIS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN ANIMALS

 

 Morphogenesis in animals involves specific changes in cell shape, position, and adhesion



 

 The developmental fate of cells depends on cytoplasmic determinants and cell-cell induction: a review



 

 Fate mapping can reveal cell genealogies in chordate embryos



 

 The eggs of most vertebrates have cytoplasmic determinants that help establish the body axes and differences among cells of the early embryo



 

 Inductive signals drive differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrates



Now that we have described the main events of embryonic development in animals, the remainder of the chapter will address the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they occur. Although biologists are far from a full understanding of these mechanisms, several key principles have emerged as fundamental to the development of all animals.
