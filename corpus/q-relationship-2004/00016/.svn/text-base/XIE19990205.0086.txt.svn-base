The statement , made by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin , was in response to the U.S. State Department 's intention to cut aid to Russia if Moscow sells conventional tank weapons to Syria .
`` We proceed from the fact that military cooperation between sovereign states is their inalienable right in conformity with the right of self-defense enshrined in the U.N. Charter , '' Yakushkin told a press briefing .
`` When implementing cooperation with other countries in this sphere , we strictly abide by our international obligations , including in the sphere of non-proliferation and export control , as well as the regime of sanctions under the aegis of the United Nations , '' the spokesman said .
He said Syria has given its guarantees that Russian weapons will not be re-exported without Moscow 's consent and that the purchased military hardware would only be used for declared purposes .
`` We have no evidence that they transfer Russian weapons to third countries or to armed and terrorist organizations operating in the region , '' Rakhmanin said .
He stressed that the Russian anti-tank equipment referred to by the United States `` is a defensive weapon '' and that `` such deliveries do not undermine the balance of forces in the region . ''
