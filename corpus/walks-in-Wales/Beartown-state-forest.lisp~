The hike begins and ends at Benedict Pond. From the north or east, drive to the junction of US 20 and MA 102, just south of the Lee exit of the Massachusetts Turnpike, and then travel 2.5 miles west on MA 102 to South Lee. Turn left onto Meadow Street, cross the Housatonic River, then turn right immediately onto Beartown Mountain Road. Follow this road uphill past the forest boundary (1.5 miles) to a fork (2.5 miles). At the fork, turn right (downhill) onto Beartown Road and drive another 4.0 miles to Benedict Pond. Park on the left in a grassy lot just past the swimming area. If you're exploring the back roads of the Berkshires, take MA 23 east from Great Barrington or west from Otis to Blue Hill Road, 1.8 miles east of the junction of MA 23 and MA 57. Turn north onto Blue Hill Road and drive 2.1 miles to Beartown Road, where there are signs for Beartown State Forest. Turn right; in 0.4 mile watch for the grassy parking area on the right next to Benedict Pond. The state forest day-use fee will be collected by an attendant on summer days. Maps of the forest are available at a bulletin board near the entrance of the parking area.

A “TO THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL” sign indicates your route southeast from the bulletin board and uphill on the former route of Beartown Road. Moss and grasses grow in cracks where the asphalt has been raised and separated by the expansion of freezing water. Red oak, red maple, and white birch shade this road lined with bracken fern. Where the old road drops into a valley, turn left (northeast) onto the white-blazed Appalachian Trail, which quickly drops down to and along the southeast end of Benedict Pond. Spotted joe-pye weed mounts its fuzzy, pink flower clusters atop purple stems in the wet ground near the pond's edge. Boulders, logs, and a small bridge help you across the wet ground between east-tilted outcrops of gneiss. Past the pond, the trail jogs left across a bridge on an old road and then immediately right. Yellow flowers perched on a network of smooth, skinny, panicled hawkweed stems decorate the path in August.

For the next several minutes you will climb steeply up ledges of lichen-coated, Precambrian gneiss, situated so its clear layering is inclined to the northeast at an angle of 30 degrees. Red oaks tower above you, and shoulder-high mountain laurel thickets keep you from straying off the path. At the top of the ledges, the trail turns abruptly right (southeast) across a gully. Before you turn, however, walk forward another 50 yards to examine a former swamp, converted into a pond by beavers. The scale of their enterprise—pond, wood-earth dam, and enormous lodge—is impressive. A chorus of twanging frogs celebrates the beavers' success. So do the blossom-covered (in June) mountain laurel plants that thrive in the increased sunlight along the shore.
