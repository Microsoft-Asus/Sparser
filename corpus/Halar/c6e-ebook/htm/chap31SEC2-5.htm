By that criterion, chytrids were excluded and placed instead in the kingdom Protista (of the five-kingdom system) because they form uniflagellated spores called zoospores (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.5</span>, p. 620). However, in the past decade, molecular systematists comparing the sequences of proteins and nucleic acids uncovered strong support for including the chytrids with the fungi as a monophyletic branch of the eukaryotic tree (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 31.4</span>). Other key fungal characteristics of chytrids are an absorptive mode of nutrition and cell walls made of chitin. Most chytrids form coenocytic hyphae, although some are unicellular. Chytrids also have some key enzymes and metabolic pathways that are common among fungi but are not found in the so-called funguslike protists (slime molds and water molds; see Chapter 28).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig31-5','../fig/big/fig31-5.jpg','fig31-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig31-5.jpg" alt="fig31-5" name="myfig31-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 31-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Chytridiomycota (chytrids).</span> The branched hyphae of <span class="Emphasis1">Chytridium</span> expose a large surface to the surrounding medium, from which the organism absorbs nutrients.

A reasonable extension of this hypothesis is that fungi evolved from protists that had flagella, a feature retained in the fungal kingdom only by the chytrids.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
