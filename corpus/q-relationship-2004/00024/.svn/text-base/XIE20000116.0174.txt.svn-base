ANKARA , January 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Turko - Greek relations have so improved that the two sides can now kick off talks on substantial problems such as Aegean Sea sovereignty , the Anatolia News Agency reported on Sunday .

`` Turkey remains committed to solve all its differences with Greece by peaceful means , the same as Greece wants to do , '' he added .
Cem made his remarks as his Greek counterpart George Papandreou will visit Ankara January 19-20 to sign a number of agreements with Turkey .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The two foreign ministers were considered the main architects of a rapprochement between Turkey and Greece , which are NATO allies but have been at odds for a long time over various issues including Cyprus and borders in the Aegean Sea .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The two neighboring countries started talks on relatively controversial issues last year and boosted relations by an unexpected outpouring of public sympathy and support when both countries suffered deadly earthquakes</ENAMEX> .
