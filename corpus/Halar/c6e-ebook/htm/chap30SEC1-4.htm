Of course, we humans, like most of Earth's species, depend on photosynthetic organisms for their ecological "services" of food production and oxygen release. What is special about our relationship with plants is our development of technology to maximize the harvest of plant products for human use. The lumber industry is an example. But the most important example is agriculture.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
