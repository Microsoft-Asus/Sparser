INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

 

 Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism



 

 Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics



 

 Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure



 

 The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators



There are different interspecific interactions--relationships between the species of a community. We will start with the simplest situation: an interaction between just two species.
