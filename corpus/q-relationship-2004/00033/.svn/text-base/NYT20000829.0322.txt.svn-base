BEIJING --
During a visit by Japan 's foreign minister , Japan and China have affirmed their friendship , resolved to remain peaceful partners and scheduled a visit to Japan in October by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji .
Yet there have been unavoidable reminders of the tensions that always lurk in relations between these two Asian powers that are struggling to contain a strategic rivalry .
Two years ago , President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan was shadowed by China 's continued bitterness over Japanese atrocities in World War II and Japanese resentment over demands for historical apologies .
Now , two days into the four-day visit by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono , the Chinese have not pressed the historical point and , according to Japanese officials , have not even made their usual complaint about Japanese - U.S. plans for regional missile defenses , which could be used against China in a battle for Taiwan .
But the Japanese arrived with unusually blunt and public complaints , about what they see as ominous Chinese maritime incursions .
They also warned that Japan 's large-scale foreign aid to China -- $ 2.2 billion in 1998 -- could no longer be taken for granted , given China 's growing wealth and what Japan considers its aggressive behavior at sea .
In late May and in July of this year , Chinese naval vessels cruised just outside Japan 's 12-mile territorial limit apparently gathering intelligence , said the Japanese foreign ministry spokesman , Yasuhisa Kawamura .
The ship movements , while not a violation of maritime law , were inconsistent with friendly relations , Kawamura said , noting that in the first incident the vessels completely circled Japan 's main islands .
Of equal concern , 30 times last year and 17 times through Aug. 7 of this year , Chinese research vessels conducted operations , without the required permission , inside Japan 's 200-mile exclusive economic zone .
Some Japanese experts speculate that the ships are mapping the offshore sea bottom , data of great value to the military .
On Monday , Kono raised these concerns in a lengthy meeting with his Chinese counterpart , Tang Jiaxuan , telling him that Japanese `` feelings of distrust '' toward China are rising , the Japanese spokesman later reported .
Regarding the naval vessels , Tang said the situation `` no longer exists , '' Kawamura told reporters .
The Japanese interpret that as a promise that such cruises would be called off for now .
As for the incursions by research vessels , both sides agreed to develop procedures to notify each other in advance of expeditions and to begin negotiations on disputes about maritime borders , which the Japanese called `` a step forward . ''
The Japanese have freely shared their concerns with foreign reporters here .
In his meeting Tuesday , Kono told Jiang that `` relations are in a good state but they are not problem-free , '' according to the Japanese spokesman .
The Chinese appear determined to prevent any open rift with Japan , stressing the advantages of cooperation .
Kono has been greeted by a raft of top officials here including , diplomats noted , Zeng Qinghong , chief of the Communist Party 's organization department , who has no formal position in foreign policy but is considered a powerful adviser to Jiang and a rising political star .
Tuesday night , China 's government-controlled media quoted Jiang as saying , `` I 'm optimistic on the future of Chinese - Japanese relations . ''
