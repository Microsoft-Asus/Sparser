CARACAS , Venezuela --
Since his election seven weeks ago , `` Hurricane Hugo , '' as President -elect Hugo Chavez is popularly called , has barnstormed Europe , Latin America and the United States sending mixed signals about how he will govern Venezuela .
On Tuesday he will put on the presidential sash at an inauguration that will launch what promises to be a presidency of surprises .
The 44-year -old former lieutenant colonel has promised a revolution to clean up the government 's chronic corruption .
He also pledges to break the stranglehold of the two traditional political parties by holding a referendum that would lead to the drafting of a new constitution .
But on other matters , like how he will manage the ailing economy , deal with the United States and Cuba and recalibrate the flow of oil exports , analysts say he remains a question mark .
Chavez has been an international curiosity since he tried unsuccessfully to overthrow an elected civilian government with a military coup in 1992 .
Afterward he was cashiered from the Venezuelan Army and spent two years in jail .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Despite his checkered relations with some in the military , he made the red beret worn by many army units the symbol of his election campaign and proclaimed his admiration for Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution .</ENAMEX>
Since his election he has been wearing well-tailored suits , but Chavez has basked in his bad-boy image .
`` I am being compared to Mussolini , Hitler or even the devil , '' he told reporters in Paris last month with a characteristic guffaw .
`` But I am a social fighter and a democrat . ''
Chavez 's globe-trotting was aimed at polishing his image and calming foreign investors who steadily withdrew money from Venezuela 's stock market last year in anticipation of his election .
Here and abroad , he told investors that he would not impose exchange controls or default on the national debt .
He said he would defend the Venezuelan currency , the bolivar , even though analysts say it is at least 25 percent overvalued .
He also promised to slash the government 's bureaucracy , strengthen central bank automony , raise the sales tax and encourage foreign investment .
With oil prices at a 12-year low and the government 's interest payments on its debt expected to rise to 40 percent of the budget this year , analysts say Chavez will probably have little room to maneuver if he wishes to avert the kind of currency turbulence now unsettling the Brazilian economy .
On oil policy , Chavez 's aides have said they would support efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise the price of crude .
But they would not commit themselves to a production cut .
While campaigning Chavez promised to reverse Venezuela 's practice of pumping more than its OPEC quota .
Venezuela is the leading source of foreign oil to the United States and is the second-biggest petroleum exporter in the world .
`` The cliche is that there are two Chavezes and we do n't know which one will be inaugurated , '' said Roberto Bottome , editor of a Venezuelan business journal .
`` He has moderated his message in tone if not in content . ''
Still , Chavez 's oratory has remained hard to decipher in recent weeks as he has painted himself as both an economic realist and a left-leaning populist .
Two weeks ago Chavez told a group of businessmen that he wanted to install a system `` where market forces truly work , where the state will be the engine of progress . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In Washington last week , Chavez met with President Clinton for 20 minutes and pledged his commitment to democracy .
But on a visit to Cuba last month , Chavez embraced President Castro anew .</ENAMEX>
