DONGHAE , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
With warships circling , South Korean navy frogmen began attaching air bags to a sunken North Korean submarine Wednesday , hoping to raise the captured craft and look inside for signs of life and clues to its mission .
The small submarine broke loose from a tow line and sank in 33 meters -LRB- 110 feet -RRB- of water a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- off shore Tuesday while being towed to this major east coast naval base by a South Korean frigate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Fearing the submarine 's capture might derail his fragile efforts to entice the North to open up its society , President Kim Dae -jung ordered his hawkish Defense Ministry to refrain from any retaliatory rhetoric , his aides said .
`` North Korea is revealing two or three faces in its dealings with us , '' the president told officers at an air force base east of Seoul Wednesday .
`` But our principles should not be shaken each time , '' Kim said , reaffirming his policy of prying open the North through more exchanges and economic cooperation .</ENAMEX>
The president visited the air base and an army command post in an apparent effort to counter criticism from some domestic news media that he was being too soft on North Korea .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` We will not tolerate an armed provocation , '' Kim told the airmen .
`` But we have to wait and see if the submarine was drifting , as the North says , or it was spying on us .</ENAMEX>
Then we will act . ''
Lt. Col. Kim Chong -sook , a Defense Ministry spokesman , said the navy salvage teams had planned to raise the submarine by Wednesday evening but rapid currents were delaying the operation .
`` It will not be until Thursday afternoon that officials will open the hatch and take a look inside , '' Kim said .
`` But our tentative conclusion is that there will be no crewmen alive inside .
They probably drowned or suffocated inside the submarine . ''
Other Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew managed to escape before their vessel was seized Monday while entangled in a mackerel fishing net just a half-mile -LRB- one kilometer -RRB- south of the North Korean border .
North Korea said Tuesday one of its submarines was missing on a training mission after experiencing mechanical problems .
Authorities described the craft seized Monday as a `` midget submersible , '' which can carry up to six crewmen and is used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance .
When the submarine was first spotted by South Korean fishermen , three crewmen were struggling desperately to free it from the net .
Navy divers got no response when they pounded on the sub 's hull with a hammer .
They also used sonar scans but detected no signs of life inside .
The discovery of the sub on the coast 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- northeast of Seoul renewed concerns that North Korea was trying to infiltrate spies despite the South 's efforts to help the famine-stricken North with humanitarian aid .
The submarine was found just miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- away from where another , larger North Korean sub ran aground off the east coast two years ago .
The 1996 incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years .
The South cut off aid and jacked up diplomatic pressure until the North apologized .
This time , presidential aides have said the incident will not derail their new policy of engagement toward the North .
The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two nations are technically still at war .
Their border on the divided peninsula is the world 's most heavily guarded , with 2 million troops on both sides .
