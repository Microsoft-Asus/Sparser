TOKYO --
First , there was news that a religious group named Ho -no-hana Sampogyo was charging people tens of thousands of dollars to tell their fortunes by reading the soles of their feet .
Then , police discovered a four-month -old corpse hidden in a hotel room by another group called Life Space .
The cult 's guru , a former tax accountant , claimed the man was still alive .
Many Japanese are wondering what 's next .
More than four years after the Aum Shinrikyo cult sprayed sarin gas on the Tokyo subway , killing 12 and injuring more than 5,000 , religious sects of all kinds are flourishing here .
That has some people worried about possible new threats to public safety , concerns that were piqued by Wednesday 's release of an Aum leader after three years in jail .
In response , the government is starting to crack down on cult activity .
Analysts say they are not surprised at the sects ' appeal .
In today 's Japan -- a consumerist , secular society facing economic uncertainty -- cults and so-called `` new religions '' offer a spiritual balm that many Japanese , especially young people , find attractive , they say .
`` People increasingly are looking for something to fill their hearts , and dangerous religious groups are just waiting for them , '' said Toshi Yamakawa , a former bureaucrat turned spiritual writer .
Fed up with what she calls the `` rampant consumerism '' of Japan , Yuko Enomoto joined a group called Place of Truth several years ago .
She attended weekend prayer sessions , where members would tell stories of how the group 's dead founder , the Great Leader , had cured them of cancer or helped them win a promotion .
So -called spiritual mediums would predict the future .
Enomoto , now 34 , became disillusioned and left after she spotted one of the group 's leaders trying on fur coats at a designer sale .
But she still feels the group had value .
`` I guess they 're a cult , but they come with some truth mixed in , '' she says .
`` I do n't think it was all lies and fabrications . ''
The number of registered religious groups in Japan has risen 15 percent over the last decade , to more than 6,500 , according to the Japanese government 's religion almanac .
Most groups register with the government for tax purposes , but that is little indication of whether their beliefs or activities pose a public threat .
Aum Shinrikyo was a registered religious corporation when it carried out the sarin gas attack .
One of its leaders , Fumihiro Joyu , was released from jail Wednesday after serving three years for perjury , fueling concerns that the group might stage a comeback .
Authorities have been responding to the growing public alarm .
A law designed to curb Aum Shinrikyo 's activities went into effect earlier this week .
Several weeks ago , police raided Ho -no-hana 's offices , on suspicion that three former believers were defrauded out of more than $ 200,000 .
The group 's leader , Hogen Fukunaga , claims to be able to divine people 's fate by examining the soles of their feet .
Fukunaga also claims he was instructed by the Pope to `` take care of things after I 'm gone . ''
Police also raided four Life Space centers , looking for evidence to prosecute the group 's leaders in connection with the death of Shinichi Kobayashi , 66 .
According to media reports , Kobayashi , a Life Space member , suffered a brain hemorrhage and was taken to a hotel near Tokyo 's international airport .
There he died , and the group 's guru spent months patting the body in the belief that it could be cured .
Many believe Japan 's economic malaise is partly responsible for the current spiritual yearnings .
`` We have focused on money and materials so much for the past 50 years that we have had it up to here with it all .
And so after the bubble economy burst , we began to look for something more in this world , '' said Yasuko Yamakawa , who translates books on spirituality .
Unfortunately , says Yamakawa , the search often draws people to fringe sects , always eager to recruit new members .
The problem , she says , is compounded by the Japanese tendency to seek out group , rather than individual , activities .
Cult watchers are especially concerned about a group called Kenshokai , which is targeting university and high school students .
Many have dropped out of school to join , and membership has grown more than threefold to 670,000 in just a few years .
Japan has for years had an uneasy , often hostile , relationship with religion .
Until the end of World War II , Shintoism was the state religion and was used to persuade the Japanese they were fighting a holy war in the name of the emperor , who was considered a deity .
After the war , many Japanese became deeply suspicious of all things religious .
Today , most Japanese follow a loose mix of Buddhist , Shinto , and Christian rites , but with little ideology attached .
Many Japanese describe themselves as secular .
Experts say that the dearth of organized religion has fueled the popularity of the so-called `` new religions , '' many of which are an amalgam of several faiths plus Japanese folk beliefs .
`` We do n't really have any religion here , so Japanese are like blank slates , '' said Seigo Iwatachi , who deprograms cult members .
Iwatachi belonged for years to the Buddhist -inspired Sokka Gakkai , Japan 's largest religious group and a political force as well .
But he says even that group has cultish tendencies -- a faith centered around an almost deified leader and , he claims , the use of mind control .
He says it took him 10 years to leave the group because their indoctrination had convinced him bad things would happen to him if he left .
Sokka Gakkai has been controversial for decades , accused of kidnapping , brainwashing , and heavy-handed recruiting .
In response , the group says it fears being tarred by the activities of fringe groups , because most Japanese are so hostile to religion , they do n't know how to separate true faith from fraud .
`` There is a backlash , people are afraid to touch religion , '' said Rie Tsumura , a spokesperson for Sokka Gakkai .
The group says it is worried that the law aimed at curbing Aum Shinrikyo could eventually be used to attack legitimate religious groups .
Former Place of Truth member Yuko Enomoto , thinks the government should only interfere if lives are threatened .
`` As long as they are n't murdering or maiming anyone , they should be allowed to do what they want , '' she said .
