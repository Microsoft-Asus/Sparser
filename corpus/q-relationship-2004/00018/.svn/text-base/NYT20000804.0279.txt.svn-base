WASHINGTON --
Behind the growing debate over whether to build a new national missile defense against countries like North Korea lies an old and bitter dispute over how to interpret the frustratingly limited intelligence on of one of the world 's most secretive nations .
Witness this incident , not previously disclosed : Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had just completed an upbeat , top-secret briefing for the House leadership in July 1998 on the Clinton administration 's dealings with North Korea when one lawmaker posed the question he had been waiting to ask .
What was Albright 's assessment of a recent intelligence report suggesting that North Korea had built a storage installation that housed components for nuclear warheads ?
How long had she known about the report ?
Albright , according to several people who were present , replied that she had learned of the evidence just two weeks earlier .
In a startling departure from the united front that top administration officials usually present to Congress , Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , immediately contradicted the secretary of state .
`` Madam secretary , I have to correct the record , '' said Hughes , whose agency had produced the report , according to others who were there .
`` You were briefed on that intelligence a year ago . ''
That tart exchange offered an unusual glimpse of the depth of the disagreements between the United States ' senior diplomats and the Pentagon 's top intelligence officials over how to interpret the few hard facts available about North Korea .
Lawmakers said the dispute spurred them to demand an independent review of the evidence on North Korea , which the administration eventually acceded to with the appointment of former Defense Secretary William Perry as special adviser .
Much of the debate stems from arcane arguments over photos or snippets of intelligence from agents .
State Department officials say the Pentagon intelligence agency , well known for its hawkish outlook , has been painting far too dark a picture , surmising on sketchy evidence that North Korea has up to 10 new installations working on a covert nuclear program .
The State Department officials said their skepticism about the quality of the Defense Intelligence Agency 's work was deepened by a 1999 incident in which U.S. diplomats leaned heavily on the North Koreans to allow inspections of a site that the intelligence agency had said was part of the nuclear program .
Nothing was found .
For their part , intelligence analysts at DIA are said to believe the State Department has been far too willing to overlook reports of suspicious activity .
In their view , the failure of a single inspection does not mean the United States should stop pressing the North Koreans about suspect facilities , including the intelligence report about the storage building suspected of housing warhead components .
The crisis over North Korea 's nuclear program began in 1993 , when analysts reviewing evidence captured by U.S. spy satellites concluded that a North Korean nuclear reprocessing facility at Yongbyon had gone `` hot '' -- had begun to process plutonium .
U.S. intelligence analysts then watched as the North Koreans dumped radioactive nuclear fuel out of the heavy-water reactor into a cooling pool in order to replace it with fresh fuel rods .
The spent fuel rods contained enough plutonium for 10 nuclear warheads , officials said .
The activity at Yongbyon led to a diplomatic showdown , and after months of talks the Clinton administration won a North Korean pledge to freeze plutonium production at the site .
In exchange , the United States , South Korea and Japan agreed to give the North oil and technical assistance to build a peaceful nuclear-power program .
The agreement called for international monitoring of the Yongbyon site , and Energy Department experts were allowed to encase the spent fuel rods at the facility to ensure that they could not be used for warheads .
Before the production freeze , North Korea was able to produce about 26 pounds of weapons-grade plutonium , U.S. intelligence analysts agree .
A consensus developed that North Korea could produce one or two bombs .
Political problems first surfaced when administration officials began to declare that North Korea had agreed to freeze its entire nuclear program .
Eventually , however , the lawmakers realized that the agreement covered only Yongbyon and did not preclude nuclear activity at other sites .
Suspicions immediately arose that the North Koreans were in fact covertly continuing work on their nuclear program .
After the administration negotiated the freeze on activity at Yongbyon , the Defense Intelligence Agency began to report that it had detected a series of other secret sites , many of them underground , that analysts suspected were related to an ongoing nuclear program .
By the late 1990s , DIA , working closely with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency , which processes and analyzes spy-satellite photographs , compiled a list of at least 10 such sites .
None , however was a `` smoking gun . ''
One official termed them `` enigmas '' : They raised suspicions , yet the United States did not have enough evidence to prove their ties to a nuclear program .
DIA analysts were most concerned about one facility that they suspected of being a storage building for components of nuclear warheads .
The identity and exact location of the suspected storage center , whose existence has not been previously made public , could not be learned .
Current and former officials say the intelligence on the storage facility was obtained at least three years ago , and was based not only on spy satellite photographs and intercepted communications , but on `` human intelligence '' -- spies -- reporting to the DIA .
The agency also detected another facility , at Kumchangri , that was believed to house an underground nuclear reactor and plutonium reprocessing operation .
The existence of that underground facility was publicly disclosed in The New York Times in August 1998 .
In May 1999 , the United States pressed North Korea to allow an inspection of the Kumchangri facility .
Before that visit , the DIA provided senior officials with extensive briefings on Kumchangri , complete with models of what DIA analysts believed the installation contained .
`` Kumchangri had all the signatures you would look for if they were putting a reactor underground , '' said one former U.S. intelligence official .
`` It had vast water supplies , and the belief was that the reactor would be water-cooled . ''
But when the U.S. team arrived , they found nothing but a series of narrow , empty tunnels , with no large underground chamber capable of holding a nuclear reactor .
The inspection was a bust , and an `` embarrassment '' to the United States , said an official familiar with the inspection .
The United States sent another inspection team to Kumchangri in May of this year , but again they found nothing to indicate that it was involved in a nuclear-weapons program .
`` It was really a joke , '' said one State Department official .
`` The North Koreans really must have thought we were idiots . ''
Some officials say that the United States gave North Korea far too much advance warning of its interest in visiting the Kumchangri site before inspecting the facility , making it possible for the North Koreans to hide its purpose .
They add that the Kumchangri facility was still under construction when it was first detected by U.S. intelligence .
`` My best guess is that it was something bad on the nuclear side , but no one knows , '' said an official familiar with the intelligence .
But the inspections of Kumchangri seriously damaged DIA 's credibility with administration officials and analysts at the other agencies , particularly the State Department .
The skepticism deepened after U.S. officials discovered that another installation that had fallen under DIA suspicion turned out to be an underground storage site for the memorabilia of the North Korean leadership .
As a result , the administration has become extremely reluctant to pursue leads on other suspected facilities identified by the DIA .
The administration has never asked to inspect the secret facility believed to be a warhead storage site , several U.S. officials said .
`` This was a prime example of policy being driven by intelligence , and at the end of the day it was wrong , '' said one State Department official critical of the DIA 's handling of the Kumchangri case .
After the failed inspections at Kumchangri , U.S. intelligence officials debated whether to conduct a thorough review of the available intelligence on the North Korean nuclear program and produce what is known as a National Intelligence Estimate , representing a government-wide consensus on the problem .
But there were so many inter-agency disagreements that no such estimate was commissioned , officials said .
At the DIA , meanwhile , the agency 's inability to provide more conclusive evidence has prompted it to take a more cautious tone in its assessments , officials said .
Adm. Thomas Wilson , Hughes ' successor , has not been as aggressive in pushing the issue , officials say .
`` DIA was driving this process , '' noted one intelligence official .
`` But there has been a change of leadership there . ''
Hughes retired in July 1999 , a year after his showdown with Albright .
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that Hughes eventually apologized to Albright , who still maintains that she had learned of the secret facility just two weeks before the hearing .
But Hughes said in an interview that while he did apologize to Albright for `` causing her public embarrassment , '' he did not apologize for correcting the record , because her testimony was not accurate .
`` I felt bad that I caused the secretary of state some embarrassment , '' Hughes said .
`` But on the other hand , I felt fine about raising the issue , and still do today .
I would have hated going away from there with Congress thinking we had n't properly informed officials about the intelligence . ''
