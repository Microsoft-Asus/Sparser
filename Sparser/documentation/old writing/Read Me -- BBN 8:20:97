Instructions for installing Sparser8/20/97Copy the entire Sparser directory to the location you intend to launch it from. Then open the file [Sparser:load Sparser] and follow the instructions in that file. In particular, modify the parameter location-of-Sparser-directory to reflect the location where you put Sparser.As those instruction indicate, the first thing you will after modifying the load file is to load it into a Lisp, thereby compiling all of the files. You then make another modification to the file as indicated, converting it into a file that will now load those binaries to create a running Sparser.When this has been done successfully, you are then to delete the source files stored under [Sparser:code:s] as they are not included in your license.  The source files in [Sparser:grammar] are part of your license and must be kept. They are supplied AS IS.(N.b. while there is every expectation that the compilation and load will operate correctly, it has not been possible to test this process on an actual unix system, only on a simulation of one running on a Macintosh. As a consequence, it is conceivable that some problems may occur.  Consult your vendor for workarounds or replacement code.)
