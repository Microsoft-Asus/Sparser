WASHINGTON , February 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Facing increased instances of witness intimidation , particularly in gang-related crimes , the U.S. House of representatives voted on Wednesday to make it a federal crime to cross a state boundary with the intent of influencing a witness in a state criminal trial .
The legislation , passed 366-49 , would impose penalties of up to 10 years in prison for intimidating a witness to a maximum of 20 years if a witness is injured .
A person who crosses a state line and kills a witness could be sentenced to death .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">There is an awful lot of crime being directed and conducted out of prisons today , '' said Representative Bill McCollum , a Republican and chairman of the Judiciary crime subcommittee .
`` And much of it is gang-related , and much of it involves witness intimidation</ENAMEX> . ''
He called the bill part of a pattern `` to try to get control over this extreme violence that is happening in our country today . ''
On Tuesday the House approved legislation to increase mandatory penalties for federally related crimes involving guns .
Supporters cited surveys showing that half the prosecutors in larger cities view intimidation of victims and witnesses as a major problem .
The bill , which has yet to be considered by the Senate , also promotes notification among law enforcement agencies of the interstate relocation of people in witness-protection programs .
