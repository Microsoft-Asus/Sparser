TIJUANA , Mexico --
In the long , lurid history of drug trafficking along Mexico 's border with the United States , perhaps no fugitives have been more notorious than the six brothers Arellano Felix .
Since 1993 , when gunmen working for them murdered a Roman Catholic cardinal , several of the brothers have been among the most wanted men in Mexico .
In 1997 , after the Arellanos were accused of killing a series of Mexican police officials , one of them was named to the FBI 's 10- Most - Wanted list .
But despite the most sustained and costly fight ever waged against one of the drug mafias that have tormented Mexico , the Arellanos and their most important associates have evaded capture , emerging as glaring symbols of the failure of the American and Mexican governments even to disrupt the powerful gangs that control Mexico 's drug trade .
Through plan after secret plan to combat the traffickers , their business has thrived .
According to American customs and law enforcement officials , the flow of drugs across this part of the border may now be heavier than ever before .
`` It 's just not working , '' said Thomas A. Constantine , former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
`` We know who they are .
We have arrest warrants against them .
But for all the high-level meetings , the task forces , the millions of dollars spent , the major figures still are n't arrested . ''
A lengthy examination of the campaign against the Arellanos , based on intelligence reports from both countries and dozens of interviews , suggests that its most basic obstacle remains the corruption that pervades Mexican law enforcement .
But although officials of both governments have come to acknowledge that corruption openly , some U.S. officials say it has become almost a blanket excuse for failings that are both far more complex and more evenly shared .
Despite some American officials ' insistence that finding the Arellanos is simply a matter of Mexican political will , there is considerable evidence for the assertions of Mexican officials that the intelligence they get on the traffickers from the United States is often inaccurate or incomplete .
Similarly , though a program to train elite Mexican police teams is a centerpiece of the United States ' international drug enforcement strategy , the training is so limited that some American officials say the new Mexican units are capable of only modest antidrug operations .
And though American agents and prosecutors have won sealed indictments against most of the Arellanos and their main associates , officials say the Clinton administration has done little to press Mexico City to join in a viable plan to apprehend them .
`` This is not rocket science , '' the former acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California , Charles G. LaBella , said in an interview .
`` The Mexicans and the Americans could get these guys tomorrow if they really wanted to .
If we were serious about it , we would pull out the stops . ''
With congressional pressure on the authorities rising in both countries , particularly after their largely unsuccessful collaboration in the recent search for mass graves purportedly left by drug traffickers in Ciudad Juarez , officials are vowing once again to step up their pressure on the Tijuana gang .
In San Diego , federal prosecutors may soon unseal some of their indictments against the Arellanos and their closest lieutenants .
Officials in Mexico City are considering moving federal police forces into Tijuana as they once did in Cancun , raiding traffickers ' safe houses , confiscating their properties and attacking their protective network .
Many officials who have worked on the Arellano case remain skeptical .
Though the Cancun operation was highly ambitious by Mexican standards , they note , almost all of the big traffickers it sought got away .
In Baja California , moreover , such promises have been heard many times before .
Although few officials recognized it at the time , the slaying of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo , during a gun battle between the Arellanos and one of their rivals at the Guadalajara airport in 1993 , signaled the emergence of a new drug threat in Mexico .
Like their most prominent rivals along the border , those accused in the cardinal 's killing were sons of a well-known drug-trafficking family , one of several clans that rose from the peasantry in the rugged poppy and marijuana fields of the western Sierra Madre .
As law enforcement pressure on them intensified after the cardinal 's killing , the Arellanos lavished money on a network of lawyers , officials and others who paid bribes and managed business beyond the brothers ' underworld .
According to one intelligence report , corrupt police agents provided them with a steady flow of stolen vehicles , while allies in the Mexican military arranged for their purchase of hundreds of AK -47 assault rifles and even M -50 machine guns .
Of every 10 Tijuana judges , one senior Mexican official who has worked in the region said , `` 11 of them are on the Arellanos ' payroll . ''
Through intermediaries , the brothers offered campaign contributions to up-and-coming politicians and loans to struggling business people .
They expanded their contacts in government offices , hotels and airports , newspapers and television stations .
Though American drug-intelligence analysts know little about their finances -- including the real extent of their wealth -- they believe the Arellanos began laundering profits into offshore accounts , real estate and other investments .
After four years of frustration , U.S. and Mexican officials resolved in 1997 to redouble their efforts in Tijuana , collaborating more closely than ever before .
To many officials it seemed inevitable that the brothers ' luck would run out .
Over the previous year , the slayings of half a dozen senior police officials and prosecutors had been attributed to the gang .
One former prosecutor was killed on his doorstep .
The federal police commander for Tijuana was ambushed in Mexico City .
The head of a special state investigations unit was shot to death in his driveway ; the killers then repeatedly ran over him with their van .
Washington ultimately detailed more than 100 agents , analysts and prosecutors to the case , and American officials sought to take advantage of what they saw as new resolve in Mexico City .
`` We are signaling a new , international effort to target this very powerful drug cartel , '' the FBI director , Louis J. Freeh , said at the time .
Initially American officials were thrilled with their progress .
First , a Mexican army general who had taken over as the federal attorney general 's representative in Tijuana stunned the Americans by turning in another general who had come to him on the Arellanos ' behalf offering bribes of $ 1 million a month .
Then , tipped off by yet another Mexican general , Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , American agents arrested two of the gang 's young gunmen at a condominium on San Diego 's tony Coronado Island .
Next , in December 1997 , Mexican police officials arrested one of the Arellanos ' better-known lieutenants and agreed to try to extradite him for trial in the United States .
A new Mexican attorney general , Jorge Madrazo Cuellar , let American agents and prosecutors comb Mexican files on dozens of killings attributed to the Arellanos so that they might develop witnesses for their own cases in San Diego .
The chief of the new organized crime force , Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz , went further , quietly assigning three of his own agents to work directly with the Americans in San Diego .
Later , over the objections of other Mexican officials , Gonzalez even arranged the secret transfer of two Mexican convicts to American prisons so they could testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence against the Arellano gang .
`` Nothing like it had ever happened before , '' an American drug enforcement official recalled .
`` Of course we were encouraged . ''
For all the new policies and programs , however , the two governments made scant progress toward their goal of arresting the brothers and their main associates .
Gen. Gutierrez Rebollo , whose pressure on the brothers had helped him gain appointment as Mexico 's drug enforcement chief , was found to be working secretly with their main rival .
The promised extradition of the Arellano lieutenant quickly got bogged down in Mexican courts .
In San Diego , drug enforcement and FBI officials grew so suspicious of a Mexican federal police commander in Tijuana that they cut him out of sensitive meetings altogether , several officials said .
Officials say the Arellanos have prospered even as they have gone deeper underground , leaving the handling of their smuggling operations and graft arrangements to an associate .
At the same time , the failings of the campaign against them have grown more evident , calling into question the two governments ' regular assertions of resolve .
