Mobile species, such as arthropod and vertebrate species, are less often hermaphroditic. Why do you suppose this is the case?</p>

									<a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">While parental care is widespread in the animal kingdom, this trait is by no means universal. Imagine you are studying the evolution of parental care in an animal group of interest to you and have mapped the distribution of care behavior on a phylogenetic tree as shown below (see Chapter 25 to review phylogenetic trees). What would be the simplest interpretation of how this behavior has evolved in these animals? If the outgroup exhibited parental care, how would your interpretation change?<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../img/ufg/UFIG46-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" name="myUFIG46-1.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1"></td></tr></table></p>

Would you want to do this if you had the chance? Why or why not? What potential problems can you foresee if this procedure becomes widely available?</p>
