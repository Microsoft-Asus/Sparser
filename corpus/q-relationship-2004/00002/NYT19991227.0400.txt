Skirting high winds , the Discovery astronauts swept to a landing Monday at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , bringing their Christmas mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope to a close .
With commander Curt Brown and pilot Scott Kelly at the controls , Discovery touched down at 7 : 01 p.m. EST .
High winds that forced the shuttle to wave off an earlier landing opportunity abated sufficiently to allow Discovery to touch down in Cape Canaveral .
`` Welcome back to Earth after a fantastic flight , '' mission control 's Scott Altman said in greeting the astronauts .
`` We had the best Christmas we could because we gave the Hubble Space Telescope back to the astronomers in tiptop shape , '' Brown said .
Minutes before its landing , Discovery sped high over Central Texas , moving west to east and leaving an orange-tinged trail visible from Houston in its wake .
The glowing trail was created by the frictional heat of the shuttle as it sliced through the Earth 's atmosphere at an altitude of just over 150,000 feet .
With their safe return , Discovery astronauts Brown , Kelly , Steve Smith , Mike Foale , John Grunsfeld , Jean Francois Clervoy of France and Claude Nicollier of Switzerland became the final space travelers of the 1900s .
Though only the third shuttle flight of 1999 , Discovery 's successful mission to restore the Hubble 's recently disabled pointing control system allowed NASA to bring a difficult year to a successful end .
The astronauts were to undergo routine medical exams , meet with close family members and rest in Florida overnight before returning to their Houston -area homes .
Clervoy and Nicollier are assigned to NASA 's astronaut core .
NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston planned a brief public welcoming ceremony for the Discovery crew at about 6 p.m. EST Tuesday at Ellington Field .
With three of the longest spacewalks in spaceflight history , the Discovery astronauts restored the Hubble 's recently disabled pointing control system with the installation of six new gyroscopes and other upgrades .
Astronomers plan to resume celestial observations in about two weeks .
Those activities came to an abrupt halt in mid- November as the telescope experienced the loss of its fourth gyro in two years .
The eight-day flight that covered more than 3 million miles proved pivotal for the space agency , which struggled this year to overcome setbacks in its shuttle , international space station and unmanned Mars exploration programs .
Discovery lifted off Dec. 19 , after a record nine delays that spanned two months .
It was the third mission in a year NASA had envisioned flying seven or eight times , most with new hardware for the U.S. -led international space station .
Instead , Discovery 's long , often deliberate launch campaign turned into a demonstration of what shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore characterized as a new resolve by NASA to fly more safely .
In late July , the shuttle Columbia experienced an electrical short moments after lift off , jeopardizing the mission .
The short was traced to chaffed insulation in the dozens of miles of electrical wiring threaded through Columbia 's fuselage .
The space agency 's response to the close call was to suspend future shuttle launchings until it could inspect and repair the wiring on Discovery , Endeavour , Atlantis and Columbia .
Though Discovery cleared the wiring gauntlet first , shuttle managers combed through the ship , calling for additional launching delays as they encountered other potential safety problems with a rocket engine , a leaky hydraulic system , external electronic cabling , a fuel line and welds throughout the propulsion system .
`` This tells everybody that we will not launch until we 're ready and satisfied we 're safe to fly , '' Dittmore said Monday night .
`` We will continue to be deliberate .
`` That does n't mean we wo n't be aggressive in our scheduling .
We will continue to make improvements .
We will continue to find efficiencies .
But we will absolutely be safe above all things . ''
The shuttle program faced other more familiar setbacks this year as well .
Russia 's financial difficulties continued to delay its launching of the international space station 's initial crew compartment , or service module .
Intended to house the new station 's first resident astronauts and cosmonauts , the service module is a pacing element for the shuttle-launched American components that are to follow .
The financial difficulties were further exacerbated by two failures of Russia 's Proton , the unmanned rocket that is to deliver the service module into orbit .
The Russians are nearing the end of their investigation into the failures as well as the preparation of a recovery plan .
Nonetheless , the service module 's launching has slipped into the spring of 2000 , more than two years late , at the earliest , pulling the shuttle 's station assembly flights along with it .
The space agency 's biggest disappointment of 1999 had nothing to do with human spaceflight .
But the loss of two robotic probes , the Mars Polar Lander in December and the Mars Climate Orbiter in September , disrupted NASA 's ambitious exploration plans for the Red Planet well into the next decade .
The $ 372 million investment in the two missions went awry on both occasions as the probes were completing their transits from Earth .
The space agency plans to begin revamping its Mars strategy in the new year .
