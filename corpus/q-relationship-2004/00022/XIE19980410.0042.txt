LAGOS , April 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- While the thousands of refugees fleeing the eastern part of Sierra Leone are suffering from starvation , hundreds of them have already died , the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday night .
The report quoted the director of information in the government information services as saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">there are now over 20,000 Sierra Leonean refugees living in two towns along the Guinean border and hundreds of them are sleeping in the open air because of the overpopulation in the border towns .
There are neither food nor medicine for the refugees and the people are dying from pneumonia and hypertension as well as other diseases</ENAMEX> , the information director said .
However , no immediate improvement of the poor situation is expected due to the poor transportation conditions in eastern Sierra Leone , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- .
What makes the situation even worse is the UNHCR decision to suspend repatriation of Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea until further notice .
The tickets issued to registered would-be returnee refugees have been re-sold to businessmen and women from Sierra Leone who since the overthrow of the junta have restarted their lucrative cross-border trade between the two countries .
The new trader-onwers of these tickets would then pack their bags and baggages of commercial items into the UNHCR hired buses , thereby evading the customs charges on both sides of the border .
Meanwhile , the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG is continuing its advance towards Kailahun district , a diamond-rich area in eastern Sierra Leone currently in the hands of the remnants of the junta forces and allied rebels .
Two strategic towns in the district , Mende Kalema and Niema , have fallen to ECOMOG .
