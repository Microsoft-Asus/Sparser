COLOMBO , October 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The victory of India 's nationalist alliance in the just-ended general election has raised fears here over the giant neighbor 's possible interference in the Sri Lankan long-running war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- .
India 's ruling National Democratic Alliance -LRB- NDA -RRB- led by the Bharatiya Janatha Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- has won nearly 300 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha , the lower house of parliament , and BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee is likely to be sworn in as prime minister early next week for the third time in three years .
`` Despite the same leaders being back in seats of power in New Delhi , Sri Lanka has to develop a strategy that would prevent assistance being extended to the LTTE , '' said the independent English daily The Island in its editorial on Saturday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In south India 's Tamil Nadu with its more than 55 million Tamil population , the Dravida Munnetra Kazahagam -LRB- DMK -RRB- of Karunanidhi , who once considered LTTE supreme leader Velupillai Prabhakaran as `` his son , '' has won the parliamentary poll and is a member of the NDA.</ENAMEX> `` Anti - LTTE forces have been defeated in India in general and in Tamil Nadu in particular , '' said a top leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front -LRB- TULF -RRB- , a Sri Lankan Tamil party opposing the LTTE .
`` The crucial difference between the present and the past is that the BJP combine is now in power both in Tamil Nadu and the center , '' said the leader , who feared that Tamil Nadu might not be safe for anti- LTTE Tamil politicians now .
The Island 's editorial said that the Indian central government as well as Tamil Nadu leaders like Karunanidhi are the `` godfathers '' of Sri Lankan terrorism .
Despite some statements by the last Vajpayee government that the Indian policy towards Sri Lanka had not changed , it was possible for those who wanted to extend a helping hand to Sri Lankan Tamil rebels to do so , said the editorial .
`` Sri Lanka has got to impress upon the Indian leadership that there are legal and moral obligations of India to help this country in its fight to eradicate terrorism , '' it said .
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year -old war fought between the Sinhalese majority-dominated government and the LTTE guerrillas who demand a homeland for minority Tamils in the country 's north and east .
The LTTE , usually branded by the Sri Lankan government as a terrorist organization , has been banned in India and the United States as well as at home due to its suicide bombings against high-ranking officials , security forces and civilian targets .
Despite the ban in India , the LTTE rebels still get massive support from India , especially from Tamil Nadu to enable it to survive the government 's military offensives , economic sanction and diplomatic isolation , The Island claimed .
``<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY"> Even now , there are about 1,500 LTTE cadres in Tamil Nadu indulging in various activities , including smuggling , '' said Suresh Premachandran , leader of the Eelam People 's Revolutionary Liberation Front -LRB- EPRLF -RRB- , another Sri Lankan Tamil party opposing the LTTE .</ENAMEX>
Given the BJP government 's past record , Sri Lankan Tamils , most of whom are tacit LTTE supporters , believe that the new Vajpayee regime will not do anything against the Sri Lankan Tamil cause as espoused by the LTTE .
On the other hand , the anti- LTTE Tamils and the Sinhalese majority fear that the new Indian government may be forced by its pro- Lankan Tamil or pro- LTTE allies to continue to turn a blind eye to the LTTE 's activities in Tamil Nadu and in the sea between the two countries , which inevitably will prolong the disastrous civil war in Sri Lanka .
George Fernandes , former Indian defense minister , had openly declared his support for the LTTE when the last BJP -led government of Vajpayee took office .
It was reported that he as defense minister had instructed the chief of the Indian Navy not to intercept a ship carrying armaments for the LTTE .
`` What role he will play in the new government will have to be watched very carefully , '' the paper 's editorial warned , hinting that Fernandes is likely to play a dominant role concerning Sri Lanka 's internal conflicts .
There is also widespread apprehension here that a BJP -led government in India could pressure Colombo to enter into talks with the LTTE .
The LTTE has proposed unconditional talks with the Sri Lankan government mediated by an active third party .
However , the government has ruled out any third party mediation and insisted that the LTTE has to give up its demand for a separate state and talks must be within a stipulated time-frame and irrespective of a ceasefire .
`` Sri Lanka should certainly try its best to have the best of relations with New Delhi and now with Karunanidhi in Tamil Nadu , '' said editorial .
`` But it should also remind India of the obligation of a big power towards its smaller neighbors , '' it said , urging India to follow its former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral 's doctrine that `` India should do more for its neighbors than what they could do for India . ''
