WASHINGTON , September 3 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The chief of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Thursday that additional charges may be brought against suspects in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
`` We have a number of other individuals in various countries who we are interested in speaking to ad may result in additional charges , '' FBI Director Louis Freeh told a Senate panel about investigation of last month 's twin bombings .
He also praised cooperation of the governments of Kenya and Tanzania , saying it was `` outstanding '' .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Last week , two suspects -- Mahamed Rashed Daoud ` Owhali and Mahamed Sadik Odeh -- were brought to New York from Kenya for trial .
They were accused of linkage with Osama bin Laden , the exiled Saudi multimillionaire , who was alleged to have masterminded the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania</ENAMEX> , killing more than 260 people , including 12 Americans , and injuring well over 5,000 .
Freeh told the Senate Judiciary Committee that there certainly would be reprisals for the arrest of the two suspects and for U.S. cruise missile attacks on `` terrorist-related '' targets in Sudan and Afghanistan , allegedly linked to bin Laden .
`` I think we can predict with some certainty that we will see a reaction , '' he said .
Some loosely organized groups such as bin Laden 's `` may pose the most urgent threat '' because they are difficult to infiltrate and track , he added .
The FBI has warned U.S. corporations with overseas offices to be on the alert for possible terrorist attacks .
Freeh said he will be asking Congress for funds to buy airplanes that would enable agents to reach any place in the world in 24 hours .
Domestically , the FBI estimated there are 25-30 groups operating that the government considers to be terrorist organizations .
