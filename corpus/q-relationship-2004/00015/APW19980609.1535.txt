Afghanistan 's ousted president said Tuesday he welcomed U.N. efforts to reduce opium poppy cultivation in his country but warned that working through the Taliban was `` indeed helping the war machine . ''
The Taliban Islamic army , which drove Burhanuddin Rabbani from the capital Kabul in 1996 , has agreed to work with the United Nations to curb poppy production and encourage farmers to grow alternate crops .
The proposal is being discussed on a wider scale at this week 's U.N. General Assembly on drugs as a way to provide financial incentives to farmers to stop growing cannabis , opium poppies and coca , the raw ingredient of cocaine .
Most of the poppies in Afghanistan , used to produce heroin , are believed grown in the 85 percent of the country under Taliban control .
While Rabbani welcomed aid , he warned against sending it through Taliban channels .
`` If I were asked , I would definitely tell them that there were other mechanisms and ways to help the southern part of Afghanistan ... rather than Taliban channels which would be indeed helping the war machine , '' Rabbani said .
Although the Taliban controls most of the country , the U.N. General Assembly never withdrew the seat of the Rabbani government , meaning he is still recognized as the Afghan president .
Afghanistan and Myanmar , formerly known as Burma , accounted for 90 percent of the world 's illicit opium production in 1997 .
The United Nations estimates that most of the heroin sold on the streets of Western Europe comes from Afghanistan .
