THE ORIGIN AND EARLY DIVERSIFICATION OF EUKARYOTES

 

 Endomembranes contributed to larger, more complex cells



 

 Mitochondria and plastids evolved from endosymbiotic bacteria



 

 The eukaryotic cell is a chimera of prokaryotic ancestors



 

 Secondary endosymbiosis increased the diversity of algae



 

 Research on the relationships between the three domains is changing ideas about the deepest branching in the tree of life



 

 The origin of eukaryotes catalyzed a second great wave of diversification



Even a very small protist such as Euglena, shown in FIGURE 28.3, is far more complex in structure than any prokaryote. During the genesis of protists, the cellular structures and processes unique to eukaryotic cells arose: a membrane-enclosed nucleus, the endomembrane system, mitochondria, chloroplasts, the cytoskeleton, 9 + 2 flagella, multiple chromosomes consisting of linear DNA molecules compactly arranged with proteins, and life cycles that include mitosis, meiosis, and sex. Among the most fundamental questions in biology is how the complex eukaryotic cell evolved from much simpler prokaryotic cells.
