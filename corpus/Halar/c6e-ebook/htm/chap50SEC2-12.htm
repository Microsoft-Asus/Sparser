At one extreme, the range of a species is defined by the worldwide extent of occurrence, a line drawn on a map around the outermost points at which the species has been observed. This is the definition of geographic range used in bird field guides and other natural history guidebooks. At the other extreme, we could measure a much smaller area within the larger geographic range and map the location of each individual. If a particular habitat is not occupied by the species, this region would not be included in its geographic range. Ecologists would like to know the actual areas occupied by each species throughout its range, but such detailed data are not available for most organisms. The important point of <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 50.26</span> is that we can measure geographic ranges on several spatial scales and that even for a single species, there may be several answers to the question: What limits geographic distribution? Abiotic influences, such as climate, are paramount on the global scale. However, at the local level, more subtle biotic interactions, such as symbiosis, may be the major explanation for why a species occurs in one locale and not another.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig50-26','../fig/big/fig50-26.jpg','fig50-26');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig50-26.jpg" alt="fig50-26" name="myfig50-26"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 50-26.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A hierarchy of scales for analyzing the geographic distribution of the moss <span class="Emphasis1">Tetraphis</span>.</span> The question: What limits geographic distribution?
