The docking was automatically conducted and went without a hitch , said experts from the Mission Control Center in Korolyov , near Moscow .
Right after the docking , astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri made sure that the docking module was tightly sealed , opened inner hatches and entered the cargo ship .
The freight aircraft , launched from Kazakhstan cosmodrome Baikonur Wednesday , delivered to Mir a payload of 2,037 kilograms , including water , air-oxygen mixture , food , fuel , spare parts and disposable materials for the station .
Progress M1 -2 is tanked with 1.5 tons of rocket fuel , while spaceships of the previous generation were capable of carrying only less than 1 ton .
