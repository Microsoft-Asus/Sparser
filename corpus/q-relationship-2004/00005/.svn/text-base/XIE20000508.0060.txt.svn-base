Cabinet Spokesman Mangala Samaraweera said the rebel offer was `` ludicrous . ''
`` This -LRB- offer -RRB- is another of their examples of psychological operation , '' said Mangala Samaraweera , who is also minister of media .
He said the rebel made the offer only because the government has stepped up its international effort for assistance .
However , Samaraweera said that the government was still committed to a negotiated political settlement of the conflict .
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- , fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka 's north and east since 1983 , said earlier on Monday they were willing to call a temporary cease-fire if the government agreed to withdraw troops from Jaffna .
Some 28,000 Sri Lankan troops are battling to save Jaffna after the LTTE scored stunning victories in recent weeks in their push to capture Jaffna , their former stronghold .
