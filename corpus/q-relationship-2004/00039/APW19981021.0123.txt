The governor of Russia 's Sakhalin region said Wednesday that the Kuril Islands must not be traded away as part of an overall peace treaty between Russia and Japan , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
The islands , located off Russia 's Pacific Coast , were captured by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II , but are still claimed by Japan .
The territorial dispute has prevented the two countries from concluding a peace treaty following the war , though their overall relations have improved in the past several years .
The islands `` cannot be small change in the negotiations over a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo , '' Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov was quoted as saying .
He said that the Russian government had not come through with funds for the federal program for social and economic development of the islands this year , but that local authorities had pressed ahead with construction of roads , bridges and other infrastructure .
`` All these facilities did not exist 10 years ago and this shows that we have returned to the Kurils for good , '' he said .
Farkhutdinov said that his region had high hopes for the summit meeting in Moscow between Japanese Premier Keizo Obuchi and Russian President Boris Yeltsin , which is scheduled for November .
`` It is very important for the Sakhalin region -- Japan 's closest neighbor -- that our states have business relations , '' ITAR - Tass quoted Farkhutdinov as saying .
In particular , he said Sakhalin was counting on progress in joint economic development and the rational use of sea resources .
He suggested his region could work with Japan to prevent poaching , `` which undermines both the Russian and Japanese economies . ''
