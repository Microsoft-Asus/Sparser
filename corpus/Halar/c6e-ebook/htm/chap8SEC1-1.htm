The most abundant lipids in most membranes are phospholipids. Their ability to form membranes is built into their molecular structure. A phospholipid is an <span class="Emphasis2">amphipathic molecule,</span> meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.12</span>). Other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic. Furthermore, most of the proteins of membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes of cells? You encountered the currently accepted model for the arrangement of these molecules in Chapter 7 (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.6</span>). In this <span class="Emphasis2">fluid mosaic model,</span> the membrane is a fluid structure with various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. We’ll discuss this model in detail, starting with the story of how it was developed.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
