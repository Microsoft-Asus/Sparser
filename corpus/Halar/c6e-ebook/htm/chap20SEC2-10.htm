If rape is involved, small amounts of semen may be recovered from the victim’s body. If enough tissue or semen is available, forensic laboratories can determine the blood type or tissue type by using antibodies to test for specific cell surface proteins. However, such tests require fairly fresh tissue in relatively large amounts. Also, because there are many people in the population with the same blood or tissue type, this approach can only exclude a suspect; it cannot provide strong evidence of guilt.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">DNA testing, on the other hand, can identify the guilty individual with a much higher degree of certainty, because the DNA sequence of every person is unique (except for identical twins). RFLP analysis by Southern blotting is a powerful method for the forensic detection of similarities and differences in DNA samples and requires only tiny amounts of blood or other tissue (about 1,000 cells). In a murder case, for example, this method can be used to compare DNA samples from the suspect, the victim, and a small amount of blood found at the crime scene. Radioactive probes mark the electrophoresis bands that contain certain RFLP markers. The forensic scientist usually tests for about five markers; in other words, only a few selected portions of the DNA are tested. However, even such a small set of markers from an individual can provide a <span class="Emphasis2">DNA fingerprint,</span> or specific pattern of bands, that is of forensic use, because the probability that two people (who are not identical twins) would have the exact same set of RFLP markers is very small. The autoradiograph in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.17</span> resembles the type of evidence presented (with explanation) to juries in murder trials.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-17','../fig/big/fig20-17.jpg','fig20-17');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-17.jpg" alt="fig20-17" name="myfig20-17"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-17.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">DNA fingerprints from a murder case.</span> As revealed by RFLP analysis, DNA from bloodstains on the defendant’s clothes matches the DNA fingerprint of the victim but differs from the DNA fingerprint of the defendant. This is evidence that the blood on the defendant’s clothes came from the victim, not the defendant. Ten different RFLP markers appear at different positions on this one "autorad" (autoradiograph). It is now more common to make separate autorads for each marker tested. The DNA bands resulting from electrophoresis are exposed to various probes in succession, with the previous probe washed off before the next one is applied.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The forensic use of DNA fingerprinting extends beyond violent crimes, For instance, comparing the DNA of a mother, her child, and the purported father can conclusively settle a question of paternity. Sometimes paternity is of historical interest: Recently, DNA fingerprinting provided strong evidence that Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one of the children of his slave Sally Hemings.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Today, instead of RFLPs, variations in the lengths of satellite DNA are increasingly used as markers for DNA fingerprinting. Recall from Chapter 19 that satellite DNA consists of tandemly repeated base sequences within the genome. The most useful satellite sequences for forensic purposes are microsatellites, which are roughly 10 to 100 base pairs long, have repeating units of only a few base pairs, and are highly variable from person to person. For example, one individual may have the unit ACA repeated 65 times at one genome locus, 118 times at a second locus, and so on, whereas another individual is likely to have different numbers of repeats at these loci. Such polymorphic genetic loci are usually called <span class="Emphasis2">simple tandem repeats (STRs).</span> Restriction fragments containing STRs vary in size among individuals because of differences in STR lengths, rather than because of different numbers of restriction sites within that region of the genome, as in RFLP analysis. The greater the number of markers examined in a DNA sample, the more likely it is that the DNA fingerprint is unique to one individual. PCR is often used to selectively amplify particular STRs or other markers before electrophoresis. Because of its selective power, PCR is especially valuable when the DNA is in poor condition or available only in minute quantities. A tissue sample as small as 20 cells can be sufficient for PCR.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Just how reliable is DNA fingerprinting? The DNA fingerprint of an individual would be truly unique if it were feasible to perform restriction fragment analysis on the person’s entire genome. In practice, as already mentioned, forensic DNA tests focus on only about five tiny regions of the genome. However, the DNA regions chosen are ones known to be highly variable from one person to another. In most forensic cases, the probability of two people having identical DNA fingerprints is between one chance in 100,000 and one in a billion. The exact figure depends on the number of markers compared and on the frequency of those markers in the population. Information on how common various markers are in different ethnic groups is key because these marker frequencies may be very different from frequencies in the population as a whole. Such data now enable forensic scientists to make extremely accurate statistical calculations. Thus, despite problems that can still arise from insufficient statistical data, human error, or flawed evidence, DNA fingerprints are now accepted as compelling evidence by legal experts and scientists alike. Many argue that DNA evidence is more reliable than eyewitnesses in placing a suspect at the scene of a crime.</p><p class="Header3">Environmental Uses of DNA Technology</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Increasingly, genetic engineering is being applied to environmental work. The ability of microorganisms to transform chemicals is remarkable, and scientists are now engineering these metabolic capabilities into organisms that will help cope with some environmental problems. For example, many bacteria can extract heavy metals, such as copper, lead, and nickel, from their environments and incorporate the metals into compounds such as copper sulfate or lead sulfate, which are readily recoverable. Genetically engineered microbes may become important in both mining minerals (especially as ore reserves are depleted) and cleaning up highly toxic mining wastes.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">The metabolic diversity of microbes is also employed in dealing with wastes from other sources. Sewage treatment plants rely on the ability of microbes to degrade many organic compounds into nontoxic form. However, an increasing number of potentially harmful compounds being released into the environment are not readily degraded by naturally occurring microbes; chlorinated hydrocarbons are a prime example. Biotechnologists are trying to engineer microbes to degrade these compounds. These microbes could be used in wastewater treatment plants or by manufacturers before the compounds are ever released into the environment.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">A related research area is the identification and engineering of microbes capable of detoxifying specific toxic wastes found in spills and waste dumps. For example, bacterial strains have been developed that can degrade some of the compounds released during oil spills. The ability to move the genes responsible for these transformations into different organisms allows the development of strains that can survive the harsh conditions of these environmental disasters and still help detoxify the wastes.</p><p class="Header3">Agricultural Uses of DNA Technology</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Scientists are working to learn more about the genomes of agriculturally important plants and animals, and for a number of years they have been using DNA technology to try to improve agricultural productivity.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Animal Husbandry and "Pharm" Animals.</span> DNA technology is now routinely used to make vaccines and growth hormones for treating farm animals and, on a still largely experimental ba sis, to make <span class="Emphasis2">transgenic organisms,</span> whose genomes carry genes from another species. The goals of creating a transgenic animal are often the same as the goals of traditional breeding--for instance, to make a sheep with better quality wool, a pig with leaner meat, or a cow that will mature in a shorter time. Scientists might, for example, identify and clone a gene that causes the development of larger muscles (muscles make up most of the meat we eat) in one variety of cattle and transfer it to other cattle or even to sheep.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Another type of transgenic animal is one engineered to be a pharmaceutical "factory"--a producer of a large amount of an otherwise rare biological substance for medical use (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.18</span>). In most cases to date, a gene for a desired human protein, such as a hormone or blood-clotting factor, has been added to the genome of a farm mammal in such a way that the gene’s product is secreted in the animal’s milk. It can then be purified, usually more easily than from a cell culture or a transgenic plant.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-18','../fig/big/fig20-18.jpg','fig20-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-18.jpg" alt="fig20-18" name="myfig20-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Pharm" animals.</span> These transgenic sheep carry a gene for a human blood protein, which they secrete in their milk. This protein inhibits an enzyme that contributes to lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis and some other chronic respiratory diseases. Easily purified from the sheep’s milk, the protein is currently being tested as a treatment for cystic fibrosis.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">Human proteins produced by farm animals may or may not be structurally identical to the natural human protein, so they have to be tested very carefully to make sure they will not cause allergic reactions or other adverse effects in patients receiving them. Also, the health and welfare of farm animals carrying genes from humans and other foreign species are important issues; problems such as low fertility or increased susceptibilty to disease are not uncommon.</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">How is a transgenic animal created? Scientists first remove egg cells from a female and fertilize them <span class="Emphasis1">in vitro.</span> Meanwhile, they clone the desired gene from another organism. They then inject the cloned DNA directly into the nuclei of the eggs. Some of the cells integrate the foreign DNA into their genomes and are able to express the foreign gene. The engineered eggs are then surgically implanted in a surrogate mother. If an embryo develops successfully, the result is a transgenic animal, containing a gene from a third "parent" that may even be of another species.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Genetic Engineering in Plants.</span> Agricultural scientists have already provided a number of crop plants with genes for desirable traits, such as delayed ripening and resistance to spoilage and disease. In one striking way, plants are easier to engineer than most animals. For many plant species, a single tissue cell grown in culture can give rise to an adult plant (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 21.5</span>). Thus, genetic manipulations can be performed on a single cell and the cell then used to generate an organism with new traits.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">The vector used to introduce new genes into plant cells is most often a plasmid from the soil bacterium <span class="Emphasis1">Agrobacterium tumefaciens.</span> This is the <span class="Emphasis2">Ti plasmid,</span> so called because in nature it induces tumors (called crown galls) in plants infected by the bacterium. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. For vector purposes, researchers work with a version of the plasmid that does not cause disease.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Foreign genes can be inserted into the Ti plasmid using recombinant DNA techniques. The recombinant plasmid is either put back into <span class="Emphasis1">Agrobacterium,</span> which can then be used to infect plant cells growing in culture, or introduced directly into plant cells, where it inserts itself into the plant’s chromosomes. Then, taking advantage of the capacity of those cells to regenerate whole plants, it is possible to produce plants that contain and express the foreign gene and pass it on to their offspring (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.19</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-19','../fig/big/fig20-19.jpg','fig20-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-19.jpg" alt="fig20-19" name="myfig20-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Using the Ti plasmid as a vector for genetic engineering in plants.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText">A major drawback to using the Ti plasmid as a vector is that only dicots (plants with two seed leaves) are susceptible to infection by <span class="Emphasis1">Agrobacterium.</span> Monocots, including agriculturally important grasses such as corn and wheat, cannot be infected by <span class="Emphasis1">Agrobacterium.</span> Fortunately, scientists can use newer techniques, such as electroporation and DNA guns (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 38.17</span>), to get DNA into the cells of these plants.</p><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText">Genetic engineering is quickly replacing traditional plant-breeding programs, especially in cases where useful traits are determined by one or only a few genes. In the past few years, roughly half of the American crops of soybeans and corn have been grown from genetically modified seed. Many of the transgenic plants now being grown have received genes for herbicide resistance. For example, the development of cotton plants that carry a bacterial gene that makes the plants resis-tant to weed-killing herbicides have made it easier to grow crops while still ensuring that weeds are destroyed. In addition, a number of crop plants are being engineered to resist infectious microbes and pest insects. Growing insect-resistant plants reduces the use of chemical insecticides.</p><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText">Scientists are also using gene transfer to improve the nutritional value of crop plants. One exciting recent advance has been the development of a transgenic rice plant that produces yellow rice grains containing beta-carotene, which our body uses to make vitamin A (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 20.20</span>). This rice could help prevent vitamin A deficiency in the half of the world’s population that depend on rice as a staple food. Vitamin A deficiency is a common problem. Currently, 70%  of children under the age of 5 in Southeast Asia suffer from this condition, which leads to vision impairment and increases susceptibility to disease.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig20-20','../fig/big/fig20-20.jpg','fig20-20');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig20-20.jpg" alt="fig20-20" name="myfig20-20"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 20-20.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">"Golden" rice contrasted with ordinary rice.</span> Beta-carotene in the golden rice kernels in this photograph is responsible for both their color and their increased nutritional value.

Nitrogen fixation is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas, which plants cannot use, to nitrogen compounds that plants can convert to essential nitrogen-containing molecules, such as amino acids. In nature, nitrogen fixation is performed by certain bacteria that live in the soil or in plant roots. Even so, the level of nitrogen compounds in the soil is often so low that fertilizers must be applied for crops to grow. Nitrogen providing fertilizers are costly and contribute to water pollution. DNA technology offers ways to increase bacterial nitrogen fixation and eventually, perhaps, to engineer crop plants to fix nitrogen themselves.</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText">Finally, we arrive at the surprising new alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and agriculture mentioned earlier. The pharmaceutical industry has long made use of plants as sources of drugs. Now, however, DNA technology has made it possible to create plants that produce human proteins for medical use and viral proteins for use as vaccines. Several such "pharm" products are now being tested in clinical trials, including vaccines for hepatitis B and an antibody produced in transgenic tobacco plants that blocks the bacteria that cause tooth decay. Large amounts of these proteins might be made more economically by plants than by cultured cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
