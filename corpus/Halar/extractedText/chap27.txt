Chapter 27: PROKARYOTES AND THE ORIGINS OF METABOLIC DIVERSITY

THE WORLD OF PROKARYOTES

   They're (almost) everywhere! An overview of prokaryotic life

   Bacteria and archaea are the two main branches of prokaryote evolution



THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND REPRODUCTION OF PROKARYOTES

   Nearly all prokaryotes have a cell wall external to the plasma membrane

   Many prokaryotes are motile

   The cellular and genomic organization of prokaryotes is fundamentally different from that of eukaryotes

   Populations of prokaryotes grow and adapt rapidly



NUTRITIONAL AND METABOLIC DIVERSITY

   Prokaryotes can be grouped into four categories according to how they obtain energy and carbon

   Photosynthesis evolved early in prokaryotic life



A SURVEY OF PROKARYOTIC DIVERSITY

   Molecular systematics is leading to a phylogenetic classification of prokaryotes

   Researchers are identifying a great diversity of archaea in extreme environments and in the oceans

   Most known prokaryotes are bacteria



THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PROKARYOTES

   Prokaryotes are indispensable links in the recycling of chemical elements in ecosystems

   Many prokaryotes are symbiotic

   Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases

   Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology

The history of prokaryotic life is a success story spanning more than 3.5 billion years. Prokaryotes were the earliest organisms, and they lived and evolved all alone on Earth for 1.5 billion years. They have continued to adapt and flourish on an evolving Earth, and in turn they have helped to change the Earth. In this chapter, you will become more familiar with prokaryotes by studying their structure and function, their origins and evolution, their diversity, and their ecological significance.
