WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- President Clinton said today `` it would be a terrible mistake '' to reject a trade deal with China even though he acknowledged that Beijing poses a growing threat to Taiwan and has a poor record on human rights and arms proliferation .
Clinton said that China 's willingness to open its markets under a trade deal with the United States is `` the kind of opportunity that comes along once in a generation . ''
The president spoke to members of the Business Council , a gathering of executives of major American companies , to press the administration 's campaign for permanent trade benefits for China , part of an agreement to admit China into the World Trade Organization .
The deal faces formidable opposition in Congress -- and ran into more trouble this week with China 's escalation of threats against Taiwan .
`` Most members of Congress do not question the economic benefit , '' the president said .
`` Critics are more likely to say things like this : ` China is a growing threat to Taiwan and other neighbors , we should n't strengthen it ; China is a drag on labor and environmental markets and rights and if we put them in the WTO they will block further progress on those issues ; or China is an offender of human rights and we should n't reward it ; or China is a dangerous proliferator and we should n't empower it . '
`` Now all these concerns , I believe , are legitimate , '' Clinton said .
`` The question is whether they will be advanced or undermined by the decision Congress will make , and America will make , on letting China into the WTO . ''
Clinton said the United States will `` continue to reject the use of force as a means to resolve the Taiwan question .
We 'll also continue to make absolutely clear that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and with the assent of people of Taiwan . ''
Clinton said the China vote was `` the most important question that Congress will take up in the first half of this year . ''
He said the United States has a huge stake in how China evolves , and that expanding trade will expose China to outside forces that would promote positive change .
`` I believe that this agreement is vital to our national security , '' he added .
