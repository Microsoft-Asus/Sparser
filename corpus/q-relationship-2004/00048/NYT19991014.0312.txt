UNITED NATIONS --
Around the world Thursday , government leaders and arms experts reacted with dismay and even anger after the U.S. Senate defeated , without much debate , a nuclear test ban treaty that had been decades in the making .
For many , there was a sense that the treaty may now be dead .
There are countries that fear American power , and those fears have been heightened by what looks like an American renunciation of any controls over its huge nuclear arsenal .
There are also nations that rest secure in the shadow of American might and leadership .
For them , the appearance that Americans are moving away from international agreements and responsibilities can also be alarming .
In either case , the example set by Washington is important .
`` If the United States , the sole superpower , refuses stubbornly to ratify a global nuclear test ban treaty that will make the world safer for all , why on earth would any other country want to do it ? ''
The Straits Times of Singapore asked in an editorial .
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping called the Senate 's decision `` absolutely wrong , '' and an aide to President Jacques Chirac of France echoed the tone of the comments in Europe when he called the Senate vote on Wednesday night `` a setback to the process of nonproliferation and disarmament . ''
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman , Vladimir Rakhmanin , called rejection of the treaty `` a serious blow . ''
In Asia , Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said the adverse effects of the Senate vote would be `` inestimable and of extreme concern . ''
`` We had hoped for the U.S. 's leadership in nuclear disarmament and in preventing nuclear proliferation , and so the result is very regrettable , '' Kono said .
China also registered `` profound regret '' but hinted that it would step up its own ratification process in the hope of keeping the treaty a live issue in world opinion .
Of the seven acknowledged nuclear weapons countries , only two -- France and Britain -- have ratified the treaty .
Russia , the United States and China have only signed it .
Israel , which is assumed to have a nuclear weapons program , has also signed .
North Korea , whose nuclear program has caused much nervousness in Asia , has not signed .
India and Pakistan , both of whom have tested nuclear bombs , have also not signed , and by wide agreement are not now under as much pressure to do so , even though many experts believe that the tensions between these two countries have made their region a potential ground for nuclear conflict .
`` All said and done , the treaty is dead , '' said Brahma Chellaney , a security analyst at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi , India .
`` Why would other nations move ahead with the treaty .
It will just go into limbo .
It 's not an issue any more .
India can just relax now . ''
Less than a week ago , an international conference in Vienna to discuss how to put the treaty into force reaffirmed support for a pact that delegates called `` internationally and effectively verifiable . ''
At the meeting , European and Asian nations urged the United States to ratify the accord .
Rejection by the Senate six days later is being interpreted by many diplomats and editorial writers abroad as a direct slap on the face of American allies and friends .
Richard Butler , the Australian disarmament expert who fought back a challenge from India to win approval of the treaty in the U.N. General Assembly in September 1996 and was present when President Clinton signed it soon afterward , called the Senate vote `` a profoundly wrong decision . ''
`` I felt in 1996 that one of the last remaining pieces in a nuclear nonproliferation fabric had been woven , '' said Butler , a diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York .
`` It is a tapestry .
It has in it the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , controls on the export of sensitive material , the atmospheric test ban , under-sea test ban and so on .
It had all those filaments . ''
If testing were banned , Butler said , the tapestry would be complete `` and we could finally get on with the business of reducing the numbers of weapons , hopefully one day getting down to zero . ''
Opponents of the treaty continue to argue that there were too many dangerous flaws for it to be acceptable to the United States .
Kathleen Bailey , senior associate at the National Institute for Public Policy in Washington and author of a study of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for the Cato Institute , said in an interview that not all nations take international agreements as seriously as Americans do .
`` When the United States signs a treaty , it adheres to its terms rigorously , and we do not cheat , '' said Ms. Bailey , who was assistant director for proliferation at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1987 to 1990 .
`` Yet we know for a fact that other nations have cheated on arms control treaties or break the norms established by the treaties .
The No. 1 example is the nuclear nonpoliferation treaty .
North Korea is still in violation of that treaty and has cheated on it .
Numerous other nations have done so as well . ''
`` Virtually all arms control treaties have been trampled upon , '' she said .
`` Those who question verification do n't have any confidence that the Russians , the Chinese or anybody else who sees it their national security interest to test will not do so . ''
One of the very few foreign leaders to put something of a good face on the Senate vote was Robert Hill , Australia 's environment minister , who said he understood that the senators were concerned about any agreement that might weaken the United States in carrying out its `` special global responsibility . ''
American arms control experts were overwhelmingly critical , among them diplomats who had devoted years to steering this treaty through the U.N. system , only to see their work jettisoned in an evening .
The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers , a group of 17 independent arms control associations accused the Senate of `` playing petty political games on a matter that effects the survival of the planet . ''
In Vienna , John B. Ritch III , the American representative at the arms control bodies based there , expressed his irritation in an interview .
`` A key aspect of the Senate vote is its effect on the worldwide inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is our first line of defense against proliferation , '' he said .
`` In practical terms , the IAEA 's on-site inspection system is even more important than the test ban since it is aimed at catching a nuclear proliferator well before the point of testing .
But politically , the test ban is needed to buttress the nonproliferation treaty .
`` It boils down to this : Not only has the Senate said no to an added line of defense against proliferation ; it has also weakened a potent defense barrier we had already constructed . ''
Except for the Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions in May 1998 , there have been no tests since French tests in 1995 and China 's in 1996 , just before the test ban treaty was adopted .
