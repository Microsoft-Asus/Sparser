Directional selection shifts the frequency curve for variations in some phenotypic character in one direction or the other by favoring what are initially relatively rare individuals that deviate from the average for that character. For instance, fossil evidence indicates that the average size of black bears in Europe increased with each glacial period of the ice ages, only to decrease again during the warmer interglacial periods. Over much shorter time intervals, Peter and Rosemary Grant documented directional evolution of beak size in a population of finches on Daphne Major in the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands (see interview on pages 426 -427). The medium ground finch (<span class="Emphasis1">Geospiza fortis</span>) uses its strong beak to crush seeds. Given a choice of small seeds or large seeds, the birds eat mostly small ones, which are easier to crush. During wet years, small seeds are produced in such abundance that ground finches consume relatively few large seeds. However, during dry years all seeds are in short supply, and the birds eat proportionally more large seeds. This change in diet is correlated with a change in the average depth (top-to-bottom dimension) of the birds’ beaks in the subsequent generation. This trait is inherited rather than acquired (by exercising the beak on large seeds, for example). The most likely explanation is that those birds that happen to have stronger beaks have a feeding advantage and so have greater reproductive success during droughts. Thus, they pass the genes for thicker beaks on to their offspring (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.13</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-13','../fig/big/fig23-13.jpg','fig23-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-13.jpg" alt="fig23-13" name="myfig23-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Directional selection for beak size in a Gal&aacute;pagos population of the medium ground finch.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Diversifying selection</span> occurs when environmental conditions are varied in a way that favors individuals on both extremes of a phenotypic range over intermediate phenotypes (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.14</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-14','../fig/big/fig23-14.jpg','fig23-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-14.jpg" alt="fig23-14" name="myfig23-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Diversifying selection in a finch population.</span> Two distinctly different beak sizes occur in a single population of black-bellied seedcrackers, a species of finch that lives in Cameroon, West Africa.

This mode of selection reduces variation and maintains the status quo for a particular phenotypic character. For example, stabilizing selection keeps the majority of human birth weights in the range of 3 - 4 kg. For babies much smaller or larger than this, infant mortality is greater.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Although we refer to these three selection trends as "modes of selection," the basic mechanism of natural selection is the same for each case.
