LAGOS , October 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Signs show that Liberia may have distanced itself from the efforts of the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG on Sierra Leone .
The signs emerged on Tuesday when Liberia prohibited ECOMOG to use its land for bombing targets in Freetown .
Liberian President Charles Taylor ordered on Tuesday the recruitment and deployment of specially trained Liberian troops to man the nation 's borders with Sierra Leone , according to reports reaching here today .
The order came one day before the dialogue between west African foreign ministers and representatives of the junta which is expected to resume today in Conakry , capital of Guinea .
Taylor also ordered the relocation of over 20,000 Sierra Leonean refugees currently in Liberia to places some 100 miles from the border , a measure he said would `` make Liberian a safe zone '' .
The Liberian government further criticized ECOMOG 's resort to bombing of Sierra Leone 's military installations , saying that Liberia did not support the use of force in a bid to restore the ousted government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah .
The action was part of the decision made Monday night at a major cabinet meeting which reviewed Liberia 's role in the Sierra Leonean crisis and the refugee situation in the country .
In a statement after the meeting , the government condemned recent ECOMOG air raids in Sierra Leone , saying it would no longer encourage the use of Liberia as a launching pad for ECOMOG forces against Sierra Leone .
Over the past week , ECOMOG has launched continuous air raids against the military junta in Freetown .
ECOMOG jet fighters have reportedly been flying out of Liberia to drop bombs on targets in Freetown .
