LONDON , May 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Mad cow disease may be quietly spreading across the whole Europe because farmers and veterinarians are failing to report sick cows</ENAMEX> , according to a report in the New Scientist magazine .
Government officials across Europe reportedly agreed that ignorance and fear were contributing to the spreading of BSE or mad cow disease and they urged better checks for the deadly disease .
`` Of course we have had -LRB- unreported -RRB- cases of BSE in Belgium , '' the report quoted Emmanuel Vanopdenbosch , head of BSE at the National Institute for Veterinary Research in Brussels , as saying .
He pointed out that animals with strange symptoms of the central nervous system had been slaughtered and often ended up on supermarket shelves .
Bram Schreuder , head of BSE research at the Dutch Institute for Animal Science and Health in Lelystad , said that 57,900 British cattle were exported to the rest of Europe for breeding between 1985 and 1990 and at least 1,688 of them should have become sick .
The European Union imposed a world-wide ban on British beef exports last March when the British government admitted possible links between BSE and its human equivalent Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease .
