TOKYO , February 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Japan has decided to impose a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone around its shores under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea , local press reported today .
The policy was approved at a cabinet meeting early today .
The establishment of an exclusive economic zone is a necessary prelude to Japan 's ratification of the U.N. -sponsored convention which entered into force in November 1994 .
The cabinet will seek Diet -LRB- parliament -RRB- approval for the convention during its regular session which ends on June 19 .
As of February 1 this year , 85 countries have ratified the U.N. convention which is seen as an international constitution on marine affairs .
Actual enforcement of Japan 's exclusive economic zone , however , requires fishery agreements with China and South Korea .
The exclusive economic zone , once approved by the Diet session , will include China 's Diaoyu Island -LRB- known in Japan as Senkaku Island -RRB- and South Korea 's Tokto Island -LRB- known in Japan as Takeshima Island -RRB- .
Local press quoted cabinet members as saying that Japan will conduct talks with China and South Korea separately in line with the spirit of the U.N. convention to reach fishery agreements as early as possible .
