*Best Walks in North Wales

Yr Eifl/The Rivals
Up to Tre'r Ceiri, the 'town of the giants'
Stunning around-the-compass panoramas from one of Wales' most impressive and best preserved Iron Age hillforts

Start: Begin to walk just to the east of the tiny village of Llithfaen. From Llanaelhaearn, on the Caernarfon to Pwllheli road, the B4417 rises steeply to 250 metres above sea level before dropping to Llithfaen. Just beyond this high point, a narrow lane bears to the left and a few cars may be parked on the verge.
Map reference: SH 367434.
Distance: 5 kilometres/3 miles.
Duration: Allow 21/2-3 hours.
Difficulty: Moderate-difficult.The ascents are moderately strenuous though fairly short as the atarting point is already 250 metres. Footpaths are good throughout although a little faint between the summits. 
Food and Drink: No refreshments on the route. Nearest pub is the Tafarn y Fic community pub, Llithfaen. 01758 750473. Caffi Meinir, Welsh Language and Heritage Centre, Nant Gwrtheyrn. 01758 750442.

There are a few places in Lleyn which escape the dramatic profile of Yr Eifl. Seen from the south or west across the pastoral interior they rise as a series of purple cones. From the Caernarfon road they tower above the village of Trefor, and from the graceful bay at Porth Dinllaen they cascade into the sea. Yet the highest top is just 564 metres/1,850 feet and little more than half the height of nearby Snowdon.

The walk: 
1. Go through the old iron kissing gate opposite (on the north side of the road) and head directly up the sloping field towards Caergribin, a prominent castellated rock on the skyline. Higher up a ladder stile leads onto the open heather covered moors. As you approach Caergribin the path curves left around the rocks. 
Your next objective, Tre'r Ceiri, can be clearly seen now rising to the northeast with its encircling walls. A narrow footpath leads through the heather, soon bearing left to join a more prominent path coming up from Llithfaen at a T junction. Turn right here and a little further on cross a stone wall by a large ladder stile. As you approach the final slopes of Tre'r Ceiri keep left at a fork and make the final rise. Enter the enclosure through the obvious enterance at the southwestern end, just above the information board, and make your way through the hut circles on the righthand edge of the enclosure to the highest point. 
Once on the summit you will see that your climb has been well rewarded; not only are you greeted by one of the finest panoramas in Lleyn, but you have before you the most impressive and well preserved Iron Age remains in Wales.
Here you will need little imagination to visualise the settlement as it was, the site is remarkably well preserved and this, along with its vast size may have given rise to the name 'Tre'r Ceiri'-which means 'town of the giants'. The outer walls, some two metres thick and up to five metres high, enclose an area almost 300 metres by 150 metres, and are composed entirely of drystone walling. Within this are the remains of some 150 hut circles of varying size and shape, all well preserved. Of particular note is the survival of the walls almost to their original height. A wall walk and parapet which enabled defenders to patrol the walls is also in amazingly good repair.
The ruins are thought to date from the mid-second century AD, although finds suggest that occupation continued until the end of the fourth century AD. A Bronze Age cairn within the enclosure indicates even earlier use of the site- common with many other hillforts, Some of these sites may have been inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age and Iron Age- a period of perhaps 1,000 years or more. 
2. From the summit walk north (towards Caernarfon Bay) and bear left to walk beside the wall. Pass a tunnelled exit in the wall and continue to a second paved entrance above the saddle between Tre'r Ceiri and the main summit of Yr Eifl. Leave the enclosure here and bear right to leave through a gap in the lower wall. Turn right immediately and follow a faint footpath which soon curves leftward through the heather with the main summit directly ahead.
As the hillside becomes steeper, the path turns diagonally-leftwards, eventually joining the main footpath which rises steeply from the left. (Alternatively, reach this point by returning to the stone wall crossed earlier and follow the main path that ascends the hillside to the right).
Turn right and make the short rise to the summit.
As one would expect, the panorama from the highest summit in the group is extensice taking in much of Lleyn;s cultivated landscape. The closeness of the sea here exaggerates the height of these little 'mountains', which fall over 500 metres to the waters of the Caernarfon Bay.
These steep northern slopes guard the secluded valley of Nant Gwrtheyrn; traditionally held to be the final retreat of Votigern, the exiled British king who lost control of his kingdom to the Saxons in the fifth century. His troubles resulted from an attempt to enlist the help of Saxon mercenaries to defend his kingdom from the Picts and Irish, His plan worked at first but things turned against him when the Saxond broke the terms of their treaty and began to seize lands and establish their own kingdoms. Vortigern is said to have fled to North Wales and sought refuge in this remote valley from his own people. Today, the valley still bears his name- Nant Gwrtheyrn means "Vortigern's Valley'.
3. From the triangulation pillar a path descends southwest, initially between two small ridges of broken rocks, the through heather with the village of Llithfaen directly ahead. Lower down as the angle begins to easem cross the faint remains of a drystone wall running at right angles to the path (this is visable from higher up on the hillside). Turn left here and follow a narrow path which runs beside the stone wall with the green dome of Mynydd Garnguwch (the hill with the nipple-like cairn on its summit) rising directly ahead.
Keep ahead where the wall disappears and cross a path that leads down to a cottage by pines on the right. Further on you meet a track, which also leads down to the cottage seem previously, The track forks here. Take the right-hand fork, directly ahead as you approach. This track shortly runs into fields where an old iron ladder stile crosses the fence by a gate. The right of way follows the edge of a depression or gulley running through the centre of the field. Follow this and just before a wall corner, bear left, cross the gulley and head across the field. Aim for a gate in the far fence which soon becomes visible. Continue through the following field to the kissing gate used at the start, to complete the walk.
