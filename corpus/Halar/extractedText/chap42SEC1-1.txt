CIRCULATION IN ANIMALS

 

 Transport systems functionally connect the organs of exchange with the body cells: an overview



 

 Most invertebrates have a gastrovascular cavity or a circulatory system for internal transport



 

 Vertebrate phylogeny is reflected in adaptations of the cardiovascular system



 

 Double circulation in mammals depends on the anatomy and pumping cycle of the heart



 

 Structural differences of arteries, veins, and capillaries correlate with their different functions



 

 Physical laws governing the movement of fluids through pipes affect blood flow and blood pressure



 

 Transfer of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid occurs across the thin walls of capillaries



 

 The lymphatic system returns fluid to the blood and aids in body defense



 

 Blood is a connective tissue with cells suspended in plasma
