The resumption of flights came after several rounds of talks between officials of the two countries on improving security at Kathmandu 's Tribhuvan International Airport , which culminated in a meeting between Indian Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav and Nepalese Foreign Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola here on May 9 .
