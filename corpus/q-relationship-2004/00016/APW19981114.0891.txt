BAGHDAD , Iraq
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Iraq insisted Saturday that its proposal to let U.N. arms inspectors resume work was genuine and free of conditions , despite the offer 's rejection by the United States .
U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan said Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz assured him that Iraq 's decision -- conveyed to him in a letter -- was unconditional and that a controversial addition to the letter `` was for our consideration and there were no conditions . ''
Iraq 's U.N. ambassador , Nizar Hamdoon , said the letter 's annex only contained Iraq 's points of view and preferences , `` but they are by no means conditions . ''
But U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger spurned the letter as `` unacceptable , '' saying it was `` neither unequivocable nor unconditional , '' and said Washington remained poised to take military action against Baghdad .
The negative U.S. reaction came within hours of an initially promising response from the United Nations to the Iraqi letter , in which Baghdad stepped back from its earlier refusal to let U.N. arms inspectors contiunue working .
Iraq hoped the letter would defuse the current crisis over arms inspections and avert a possible U.S. military strike .
Iraq insisted that the threat of force was not a factor in its decision .
`` We offer this chance not out of fear of the aggressive American campaign , '' the Iraqi government said .
Instead , Aziz 's letter repeated Iraq 's goal that renewed cooperation would `` give a further chance to achieve justice by lifting sanctions '' imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait .
The U.N. Security Council met Saturday night to decide whether Iraq 's stand meets its demands for unconditionally allowing the inspectors to work .
`` I think at least they 've made a step in the right direction , '' Annan said Saturday .
But British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Saturday that the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq is `` by no means over yet , '' saying it is unclear whether Iraq 's offer is unconditional .
Berger said military action still remained an option for U.S. President Bill Clinton and suggested that it could be taken at any time .
`` We have every reason to be skeptical .
We 've seen this before , broken and unfulfilled promises , '' he said in Washington .
`` The Iraqi letter is neither unequivocable nor unconditional . ...
It 's unacceptable . ''
Berger spoke after Clinton cancelled his trip to an economic summit this week in Malaysia .
Aziz 's letter Saturday capped a flurry of diplomatic activity over 24 hours , including a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Russian ambassador to Baghdad and a crucial letter from Annan .
In the end , it may have been Annan 's personality at the center of Iraq 's reversal .
Aziz 's letter repeatedly referred to Iraq 's trust in the secretary-general and his `` good faith and sincerity . ''
It was Annan who had defused the previous crisis in February when Iraq blocked the inspectors -- who are responsible for searching for Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction -- from visiting Saddam 's palaces .
The United States and Britain have amassed a force in the Gulf to pressure Iraq into compliance in the latest showdown .
Iraq credited Security Council members Russia , China and France for helping to defuse the standoff .
The three countries have endorsed an easing of sanctions , but they have been less vocal in the current crisis .
Russia , for example , did not send an envoy to personally mediate this time .
Aziz 's message to Annan , however , continued to pose a problem .
U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah earlier told a news conference in Baghdad that Aziz 's letter put no conditions on the return to Baghdad of the inspectors , who left Iraq on Wednesday .
But the two-page annex reiterated Iraq 's previous terms for a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions .
It was n't clear whether the Security Council would interpret the annex in the way that Baghdad hopes .
Annan 's reading of the letter , said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard , is that it `` does not have any conditionality attached to it . ''
In the letter , Aziz urged Annan to ensure that a comprehensive review will be `` serious , fair and fruitful . ''
The annex urged that the comprehensive review be carried out within a short time , `` seven days for example . ''
In some cases , Iraq 's positions are watered-down versions of past demands .
The United States and Britain have been adamant that there be no easing of sanctions unless Iraq fulfills requirements to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction .
The council has said sanctions will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that all such weapons have been destroyed .
Hamdoon said in New York that inspectors would be allowed to return to Iraq immediately .
He added that Annan 's letter on Friday had promised `` that Iraq 's case would be looked on favorably and the comprehensive review would be taking place in the right time . ''
Elsewhere , both Israel and the Palestinians welcomed signs that a possible military strike against Iraq had been averted .
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles into Israeli cities during the Gulf War .
On Thursday , the foreign ministers of six Gulf nations joined Egypt and Syria in issuing a communique warning that they would hold the Iraqi government responsible for any consequences for its refusal to back down .
Still , Iraq once again brought attention to the U.N. sanctions , which limit the sale of oil , have devastated Iraq 's economy and made its 22 million people dependent on a U.N. relief program .
