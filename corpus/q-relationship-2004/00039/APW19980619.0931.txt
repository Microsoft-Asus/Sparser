Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Japan 's proposals for the disputed Kuril Islands are `` very interesting , '' the Interfax news agency said .
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made new proposals when he and Yeltsin met in Japan in April .
They have not been made public , but Japanese media say Tokyo proposes taking over the islands legally , but allowing Russian to retain control for some time .
The dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain , seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II , has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty .
The proposals `` are very interesting , but it is risky to reply to me friend Ryu out of hand , '' Yeltsin said in the central Russian city of Kostroma .
`` We will study the issue of Hashimoto 's proposals , taking into account the overall development of relations . ''
