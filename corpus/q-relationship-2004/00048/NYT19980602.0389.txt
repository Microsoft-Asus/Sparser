Almost immediately after becoming president of Indonesia , B.J. Habibie pledged to create `` a clean government , free from corruption , collusion , and nepotism . ''
But one of the biggest threats to his rule may be growing concern that he and his family , following the model of former President Suharto , used public office to amass a private fortune .
In the nearly two weeks since he replaced Suharto , Indonesian economists and political activists have begun to document the sprawling business holdings of Habibie 's children and close relatives .
The Habibie family does not have anything approaching the wealth of the Suharto clan .
But Indonesian analysts say its worth might reach $ 80 million .
That , however , does not factor in the wealth-destroying effects of the country 's economic crash .
`` You can say that in this respect he is an A student of Suharto , '' says Rizal Ramli , an Indonesian economist who has collected data on the business holdings of top government officials .
`` We no longer have Suharto but we still have cronyism . ''
In an interview on Tuesday with The New York Times , Habibie defended his own wealth and that of his family members , saying nepotism had not played a part in their apparent success .
He acknowledged that some of his relatives have grown rich , but said they did so because of their strong education and work habits .
Many of his brothers , sisters and children do business with government agencies , Habibie said .
But he insisted that they do not get special treatment .
And he appeared to reject calls to force his family to give up government contracts or dissolve business partnerships that have come under scrutiny .
`` Many people become rich if you work hard and you are educated , '' Habibie said .
`` And now they have to stop because I am the president for two weeks ? ''
In his long political career , Habibie supervised some of Indonesia 's highest-profile development projects .
His purview included the state aircraft maker , a natural gas project , the Batam island development zone , and the state technology agency .
Potential conflicts of interest between the offices Habibie has held and his family 's holdings are not hard to spot .
Habibie 's two sons have business ties to the aircraft company , while one has contracts connected with the natural gas project .
Two of Habibie 's brothers and a brother-in-law have close ties to Batam island development project .
His sister plays a key role in the state technology agency , while her husband has worked as a contractor there , according to officials at each company .
The best known Habibie -linked company is controlled by his youngest brother , Timmy .
Timsco Holdings has several score subsidiaries operating in many different businesses , some of them dependent on government contracts or licenses .
Several Indonesian economists compare Timmy Habibie 's operating style to that of Bambang Trihadmodjo , Suharto 's middle son , which is characterized more by personal contacts than any particular expertise .
Habibie 's long involvement in the Batam island project has raised the most conspicuous conflicts .
Though Suharto appointed Habibie to supervise the conversion of Batam , located near Singapore , into a manufacturing center and export zone , Habibie has governed it like a personal fiefdom , says investors and employees on Batam who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Habibie long worked hand-in-hand with his brother-in-law , Sudarsono Darmosuwito , now retired , the zone 's chief executive .
When Habibie took the office of vice president earlier this year , he appointed a younger brother , Effendi -LRB- Fanny -RRB- Habibie , to succeed him as chairman of the Batam Island Development Authority , the island 's main governing body .
Fanny Habibie told Indonesian reporters last month that he will step down from the chairmanship .
But that only begins to address the Habibie family interests there .
Sudarsono , for example , controls two companies that have benefited from exclusive Batam licenses .
P.T. Citra Lingkunan Lestari has done environmental impact surveys on behalf of investors wishing to set up factories there .
P.T. Indori Mandiri Sakti has had exclusive rights to construct and manage Batam 's two major harbors .
Meanwhile , Timmy Habibie , Bambang , and Habibie 's two sons , Ilham and Thareq , are partners in the main industrial park on Batam , called Batamindo Industrial Park .
Foreign businessmen familiar with the Batam project said that virtually anyone who sought to set up export operations there was encouraged to do so within the family-controlled park .
