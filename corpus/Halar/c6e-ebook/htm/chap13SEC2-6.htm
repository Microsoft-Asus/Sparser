Darwin recognized the importance of genetic variation in the evolutionary mechanism he called natural selection. Recall from Chapter 1 that a population evolves through the differential reproductive success of its variant members. On average, those individuals best suited to the local environment leave the most offspring, transmitting their genes in the process. This natural selection results in adaptation, the accumulation of the genetic variations favored by the environment. As the environment changes or a population moves, the population may survive if, in each generation, at least some of its members can cope effectively with the new conditions. Different genetic variations may work better than those that prevailed in the old time or place. Sex and mutations are the two sources of this variation, and we have considered the sexual contribution in this chapter.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Although Darwin realized that heritable variation is what makes evolution possible, he could not explain why offspring resemble--but are not identical to--their parents. Ironically, Gregor Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin, published a theory of inheritance that helps explain genetic variation, but his discoveries had no impact on biologists until 1900, more than 15 years after Darwin (1809-1882) and Mendel (1822-1884) had died. In the next chapter, you will learn how Mendel discovered the basic rules governing the inheritance of specific traits.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
