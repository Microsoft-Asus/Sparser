SOFIA , August 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Bulgaria 's Trade and Tourism Minister Valentin Vassilev said that the country is trying to find ways to solve trade and tourism problems with Russia .
At a news conference after meeting with the directors of the tourist resorts on the northern Black Sea city of Varna , he attached particular importance to relations between Russia and Bulgaria .
`` We must be ready to talk with any government .
Governments go , and Bulgaria and Russia stay , '' he referred to Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov 's visit to Moscow later this month .
Stoyanov had said his trip to Moscow would facilitate the growth of Bulgarian - Russian ties and the move toward a more transparent and pragmatic relationship .
Russian tour managers and journalists will be invited to Bulgaria in late September .
The idea has been suggested because of the 10 to 30 percent fall in the number of Russian holiday makers in Bulgaria this season .
Russia and Bulgaria enjoyed close relations in politics , economy and trade in the Soviet era .
But sofia has distanced itself from Moscow in recent years as Russia was unhappy with Bulgaria 's bid for membership of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
