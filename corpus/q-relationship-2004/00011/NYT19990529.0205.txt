WASHINGTON --
Four years ago a Chinese agent walked into an American embassy and handed over stacks of classified documents to the CIA , just like in a spy novel .
But was he still working for Beijing ?
Some of his papers contained bad information .
Yet one document alerted U.S. intelligence that the Chinese had plans for a sophisticated , miniature nuclear warhead remarkably like those used atop American missiles .
It pointed to an extensive intelligence leak at American weapons labs .
It set off an uproar over national security .
And it reignited longstanding suspicions about China and sparked other questions that America is still trying to answer .
Such as : Why would a Chinese agent help American spycatchers ?
`` For a spy novelist , '' said author David Ignatius , `` that 's just too juicy . ''
Was Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee really a mole , one whose success with a hard drive would dumbfound a James Bond ?
Maybe , maybe not , experts say .
And one other question , a huge one : How should the U.S. react ?
To that , experts on espionage remind us that this is not a novel .
It is the real world of international relations , where even the coziest allies snoop on one another .
Nobody should be shocked by charges that China , which the U.S. has been courting by opening up trade and downplaying its human-rights abuses , is spying on the world 's military giant .
`` We 've known that for a long time , '' said Robert Gates , a career intelligence officer who headed the CIA in the early 1990s .
`` We have to get ourselves out of the Cold War mindset that you 're either all our friends or all our enemies .
Most countries in the world are going to be simultaneously our friends or adversaries in different areas . ''
That does not sit well with U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher .
`` China is a monstrous military dictatorship , and they hate us .
We 're bending over backwards pretending they 're our friends , when we should be recognizing them as our enemies , '' said the California Republican .
`` If Adolf Hitler had stolen the technology to drop a nuclear bomb , should we have shrugged our shoulders and said , ` Well , spying is spying ' ? ''
Many are calling for retaliation by pulling back from talks with the Chinese on trade issues , denying them entry into the World Trade Organization .
Some observers argue that Americans who share Rohrabacher 's outrage are guided not only by us-against-them notions about the spy trade , but also by fears that China will be our rival for superpower status in the 21st century .
`` The way nations today usually react to spying allegations is , they kick out a few delegates , exchange nasty notes and then , amid all the embarrassment , they go back to doing business , '' said Gregory Treverton , co-author of In from the Cold , a report on the future of U.S. intelligence .
`` But something in us likes and fears the idea of superpowers ' squaring off .
We 're familiar with this environment .
The Cold War demonstrated that interests in Washington can benefit from this . ''
Espionage is simply the way of the world , and it has been at least since the Bible .
Joshua used spies .
So did Moses .
Sun Tzu , the Chinese military philosopher , wrote : `` Spies are sent into the enemy camp bearing false information , then unmasked in order to create confusion and turmoil . ''
That seems especially appropriate when the question is raised : What was the mysterious Chinese agent supposed to accomplish in giving the CIA those documents in the first place ?
Some have pointed to a disinformation effort by Beijing .
Triggering a spy-hunting attitude toward Chinese scientists could help stem a brain drain to the U.S. Perhaps the Chinese simply made a mistake , giving the CIA an unexpected but important insight on the W -88 warhead while trying to lay the groundwork to prepare a future triple agent .
Or maybe a few well-placed hard-liners in the Chinese government believed that Beijing was getting too cozy with the Americans .
In the spy business , things often are not as they seem .
Take France .
Five Americans -- four of them CIA agents -- were expelled from Paris in 1995 after authorities there accused them of political and economic espionage .
The bungled operation forced the U.S. to suspend nearly all of its covert operations in France .
French intelligence , in turn , reportedly has spied on U.S. companies by wiretapping American businessmen flying Air France between New York and Paris .
`` The French conduct the most aggressive espionage against us of any country in world , but they 're allies in the Balkans , '' former CIA Director Gates said .
`` That 's the way it 's going to be for most countries . ''
Jonathan Jay Pollard , a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst , spied for another ally , Israel , which rewarded him for supplying so many documents that experts said they would fill a 360-square-foot box .
Steven Lalas , a U.S. Embassy employee in Athens , gave Greece the names of CIA agents .
Just this month , undercover FBI officers arrested a former Australian intelligence agent -- Jean - Philippe Wispelaere , 28 -- after he allegedly cut a $ 120,000 deal to sell them top-secret U.S. satellite photos and classified documents .
Court papers identify the nation for which Wispelaere was thought to be working only as `` Country A. '' By far the most sensational spy cases of recent times , until the China scandal , have featured Americans selling out to the once-dreaded Communists of Moscow .
CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames and his wife , Rosario , passed on classified information to the Soviet Union in what , until now , officials called the most damaging case in U.S. history .
Ames is blamed for the deaths of at least nine American agents in the Soviet Union .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">John A. Walker Jr. , a retired Navy warrant officer , led a family spy ring that for two decades sold our missile submarine information to Moscow .
Spying permeates the conduct of international commerce and diplomacy .</ENAMEX>
`` The danger you get into is moral equivalence , '' said Vince Cannistraro , former director of clandestine services for the CIA .
`` Most modern economic espionage is about getting a bead on a new kind of chip design , or getting an advantage on World Trade Organization negotiations , '' said Ignatius , whose portrayal of fictional espionage is praised in the intelligence community .
`` You have to distinguish between the things that could get you killed and the things that wo n't . ''
The Chinese spy scandal , said Ignatius , a columnist for The Washington Post , `` has the potential to create a genuine strategic threat that would put our lives at risk . ''
