UNITED NATIONS , June 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United Nations Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- today called on all sides in Sierra Leone to put an end to the use of children as combatants and to incorporate provisions for their physical and emotional welfare in a future peace settlement .
`` Children should have no part in war , '' said Carol Bellamy , UNICEF 's Executive Director .
`` By making them agents of civil conflict and depriving them of their childhood , the vicious cycle of violence is perpetuated . ''
Sierra Leone has one of the world 's worst records for recruiting child soldiers .
Between 1992 and 1996 , in the previous period of civil unrest between the government and the Revolutionary United Front , an estimated 4,500 children were forced to fight on both sides .
Since May 25 , when the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council took power in a coup , witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of armed children in the streets of the capital , Freetown .
Bellamy called for the immediate demobilization of all child soldiers .
The proposals outlined in the 1996 Report on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children by Graca Machel should be urgently implemented , she added .
