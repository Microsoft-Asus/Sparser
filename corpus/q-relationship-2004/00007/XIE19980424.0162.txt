ISLAMABAD , April 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United States has renewed its interest in the war-torn Afghanistan after years of disinterest following the withdrawal from the country of the troops of the former Soviet Union .
The rekindled U.S. interest in Afghanistan , which has been suffering from endless wars for decades , is evident from the latest visit to the country by U.S. President Bill Clinton 's special envoy and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson .
Richardson made a day-long trip to Afghanistan on April 17 , becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official to have stepped on Afghan soil in 20 years .
The visit has been hailed as a `` turning point '' after years of apparent U.S. lack of interest in the Afghan issue and analysts here see it as the sign of growing U.S. interest in Afghanistan .
It indicates a recognition in the United States that Washington can no longer afford to ignore Afghanistan in any of its strategies for the region .
During his stay in Afghanistan , Richardson held separate talks with leaders of the Taliban militia and the Anti - Taliban Northern Alliance .
As a result , the two Afghan rival factions agreed for the first time to meet face-to-face on April 25 in Islamabad , capital of Pakistan .
Although the situation in Afghanistan never lacks the element of unpredictability and it is hard to forecast what will turn out if the proposed meeting is held , the agreement represents , by any means , the first dawn on the Afghan horizon since September 1996 when the Taliban took over the capital of Kabul .
It is clear that Washington is now pushing for an early and swift resumption of multi-party dialogue in Afghanistan .
However , the question remains of what has led to the renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan .
It is clear that the U.S. bid for peace in Afghanistan has two distinct goals .
The first and short-term one is to mediate an immediate cease-fire and end hostilities among the warring factions and give further impetus to the U.N. peace initiative .
The second and longer-term goal is to create a framework which can eventually lead to the desired establishment of a broadly -based government in that war-ravaged country .
But these are only the apparent reasons for the fresh U.S. interest in the Afghan issue .
There are also other considerations which are of strategic importance .
Analysts here noted that the United States first got involved in the Afghan issue because its security interests were under the threat of the former Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan , which could eventually result in the Soviet Union 's access to warm-water sea ports .
With the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and the later disintegration of the Soviet Union , the threat to U.S. interests receded .
However , the Americans believe that such a threat , or a potential one , now seems re-emerging for several reasons .
First , Afghanistan has become the world 's largest opium producer and is one of the most critical points on the route through which most drugs are smuggled into Europe and the United States .
The United States has made constant efforts to curb drug smuggling and eradicate poppy production in and around Afghanistan .
However , the efforts have produced limited success .
The Americans have finally realized that better results could be achieved only through deeper engagement and by ending Afghanistan 's endless civil war .
Second , Afghanistan has been a place where arms smugglers are active .
Although the problem of arms smuggling does not bother the United States as much as drug smuggling so long as its destination remains to be Pakistan , Washington could hardly afford to remain indifferent when terrorists begin looking for U.S. targets .
Third , the long-running civil war in Afghanistan could jeopardize U.S. trade interests in the fast-developing markets of Central Asian republics .
Exports to and from these newly-independent countries could be carried out much more profitably through Afghanistan than through other countries .
Last but not least , Afghanistan is the key to integrating natural resources-rich Central Asia into the global economy and to exploiting the region 's investment and business potential .
In the last few years , American companies have developed a huge financial stake in Central Asia and are desperate for gaining access to the region 's rich energy resources and developing trade links with it .
All these factors are believed to have made Afghanistan a crucial point for renewed U.S. interests , as reflected by the visit of Richardson .
Yet the U.S. efforts to create `` a broadly -based government '' in Afghanistan would mean nothing if the Taliban , which control more than two-thirds of Afghan territory , do not accept the idea of power sharing with its rival factions .
