AUSTIN , Texas --
Prison officials acknowledged Friday that a rare order to keep more than 120,000 inmates locked in their cells indefinitely was issued in an effort to keep two of the largest and most violent prison gangs from waging war inside the system .
In a memo to members of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice , Wayne Scott , executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , said he ordered the unusual lockdown because , `` We anticipate retaliation by -LRB- one gang -RRB- upon -LRB- the other -RRB- . ''
The lockdown was ordered Thursday following the gang-related stabbing death of an inmate at the Coffield Unit near Palestine , but in their public statements , prison officials downplayed concern over gang violence erupting .
Scott 's memo was released Friday to the Houston Chronicle .
`` Due to this most recent homicide and the potential for a violent retaliatory response by the -LRB- one gang -RRB- , I have imposed a lockdown of all secure TDCJ facilities effective immediately , '' Scott wrote in the memo .
`` This lockdown will allow unit staff and STG -LRB- security threat group -RRB- staff to monitor closely the communications of known and suspected STG members and will allow for a thorough and complete search for weapons at all of our facilities .
It is important to remember that suspected STG members are housed in facilities around the state and are found in all custody levels . ''
The TDCJ refers to gangs as security threat groups .
Prison spokesman Glen Castlebury declined to say which prison gangs were involved and the copy of the memo he released had the names deleted .
However , a veteran correctional officer at the Coffield Unit identified the gangs as the Texas Syndicate and Hermanos de Pistoleros Latinos -LRB- Brotherhood of Latin Gunmen -RRB- .
The officer , who was on duty when the stabbing occurred , asked not to be identified .
A prison gang expert estimated that as of last July , the Pistoleros Latinos had a confirmed membership of about 380 plus another 360 suspected members , while the Texas Syndicate had an estimated 840 confirmed members and 1,490 suspected members .
Castlebury said he did not know what specific intelligence reports gang experts had that prompted them to warn wardens throH UQ the system that the murder of Roland Rios , 41 , of Corpus Christi on Thursday was more likely to provoke gang warfare than other inmate stabbings in recent years .
The earlier stabbing incidents did not prompt a system-wide lockdown .
`` I think it was the gauging of the intelligence '' that made the difference in this incident , he said .
`` You 're going to get stabbings where gang members agree the -LRB- guy -RRB- deserved killing , and then you 're going to get stabbings '' that prompt retaliation .
He added it would `` not be wrong to assume '' that intelligence officers saw something different in Rios ' slaying .
But he also dismissed claims that a full-scale gang warfare was about to erupt .
And he stood by prison administrators ' earlier statements that a system-wide lockdown had been in the planning stages for about two weeks and was merely moved up after Rios was murdered .
Authorities identified Rios ' killer as 26-year -old Antonio Lara , who is serving a 15-year sentence for attempted murder , robbery and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Webb County .
Rios , who was serving 10 years for aggravated robbery and injury to a child convictions out of Nueces County , apparently was a member of the Texas Syndicate .
The Coffield correctional officer , however , predicted , `` This is going to be a blood bath .
The Texas Syndicate is not going to stand by and see one of theirs killed .
`` These people are going to retaliate , '' he added .
`` TDCJ is trying to stop a blood bath under the pretense of conducting a shakedown . ''
He said the shakedown had turned up only one weapon -- a 9 1/2-inch steel shank a prisoner had fashioned from a flat piece of metal -- as of Friday .
While system-wide lockdowns are rare , partial lockdowns at individual units are not .
For example , prison records indicate that last month alone , 25 of the state 's 112 prison units had at least some portions of their facilities in lockdown status .
Among those was the Coffield Unit , where felons in some wings had been locked in their cells since Feb. 17 because of gang disturbances .
Indeed , of those 25 units 19 still had some inmates restricted to their cells , and wardens at 11 of the facilities cited gang activity or racial tension as the reason for the lockdowns .
