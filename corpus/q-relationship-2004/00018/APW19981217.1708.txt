SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
After a nearly six-hour pursuit , South Korean navy ships sank a North Korean submarine Friday in a gun battle off the south coast , military officials said .
The body of one North Korean crewman was recovered after the 10-ton sub was sunk 100 kilometers -LRB- 62 miles -RRB- off the tip of the Korean Peninsula before dawn , the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said .
The sub was first spotted as it approached shore near Yosu , a small port 320 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- south of Seoul , shortly before midnight Thursday , it said .
The sub then fled southeast , pursued for 5 hours , 40 minutes by South Korean navy ships and air force planes , the office said .
The planes dropped depth charges to block its escape , the office said .
Hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped by a South Korean transport plane , the fleeing sub opened fire at the pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire , it said .
`` We fired several warning shots , but the enemy craft continued to flee and fired at us .
Therefore , we attacked and sank it , '' said Col. Hwang Dong -kyu , a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman .
About two hours later , South Korean troops recovered the body of the crewman .
A hand-grenade was found in his pocket , officials said .
Navy frogmen were searching for more bodies .
There were no South Korean casualties , they said .
On shore , South Korean soldiers and police were put on high alert , increasing security checks for possible infiltrators from the sub , officials said .
South Korean officials said the sub , with an estimated four crewmen , was believed to be on an espionage mission .
Chief presidential spokesman Park Jie -won praised the swift military action and urged North Korea to stop armed provocations to promote peace on the peninsula .
In Washington , U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley called the sub 's intrusion a `` very serious matter . ''
North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up spies along South Korea 's long coastline , officials said .
Several have been detected in recent years .
In June , a 70-ton Yugo -class North Korean submarine was found in South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and periscope tangled in a fishing net .
South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches and found nine bodies , all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact .
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission .
The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site .
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection .
North Korea claims that the facility under construction at Keumjang -ri north of the country 's capital , Pyongyang , is for civilian use , but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related .
North Korea 's military has denounced the U.S. demand for inspection as `` a declaration of war . ''
About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty .
The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 .
They are still technically at war , because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty .
