WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The United States warned Pakistan on Thursday that it could be branded a sponsor of terrorism -- making it ineligible for virtually all U.S. aid -- if it gave direct support to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir .
In issuing the warning the State Department was also sharply critical of the military-run government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf for requiring judges to take a loyalty oath .
`` This move by General Musharraf undermines the integrity and independence of the judiciary in Pakistan , '' spokesman James P. Rubin said .
On Wednesday , six Supreme Court justices refused to take the oath , which would shield the military from legal action .
`` Gen .
Musharraf needs to make clear in a comprehensive fashion how he intends to return Pakistan to an elected government with a functioning legislature and an independent judiciary under a democratic constitution , '' Rubin said .
President Clinton is expected to decide soon whether he will include Pakistan in a March trip to India and Bangladesh .
Earlier this week , Clinton and the State Department said there was no evidence Pakistan supported the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in December .
However , Rubin said at the time the hijackers may have been linked to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir .
The group , known as Harkat ul- Mujahedeen , was placed on the department 's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat ul- Ansar .
Rubin also said there has long been concern that agencies of the Pakistani government provided `` general support '' to a number of groups operating in the territory disputed by India and Pakistan .
On Thursday , the U.S. official said `` that is a matter of extreme concern to us '' and that senior administration officials had taken it up with top Pakistani officials .
`` If the secretary of state determines that a government has repeatedly provided support of international terrorism directly , then she would be prepared to designate that country as a state sponsor of terrorism , '' Rubin said .
He said that was not a threat , but rather `` a comment about the realities . ''
Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and Michael Sheehan , the coordinator of the department 's office to counter terrorism , conveyed U.S. concerns about terrorism and anti-democratic tendencies in talks last week in Pakistan , Rubin said .
The hijacking incident ended with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the Indian government 's release of three members of the group .
The seven countries listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism are ineligible , under federal law , for virtually all U.S. assistance and for U.S. support in international lending institutions .
They are Syria , Iran , Iraq , Cuba , Sudan , North Korea and Libya .
`` Let me be clear , '' Rubin said , `` we are not conducting business as usual with Pakistan , in light of the October coup there . ''
