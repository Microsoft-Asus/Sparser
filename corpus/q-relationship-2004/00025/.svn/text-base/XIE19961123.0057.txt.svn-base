SHENZHEN , November 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A senior legislator of China 's National People 's Congress , said here today that troops of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- stationed in Hong Kong will not be allowed to take part spontaneously in disaster-relief work .
Qiao Xiaoyang , deputy director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee , made the statement at a meeting on the Law on Stationing Troops , where he said that troops stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region `` must strictly abide by the Basic Law and the Law on Stationing of Troops .
Noting that the PLA is the Chinese people 's own army , he said that when a disaster occurs in interior areas , its men can take prompt action to involve themselves in combating the disaster or doing relief work .
However , after July 1 , 1997 , he noted , `` even if there is an unexpected catastrophe in Hong Kong , members of the resident troops cannot take part in disaster-relief work spontaneously , as they do in the interior areas . ''
Those troops in Hong Kong , he went on , can take part in disaster-relief work only after the SAR government submits a request to the central government and receives orders from the Central Military Commission .
And their actions should be coordinated by the SAR government and return to their barracks as soon as they accomplish the task , Qiao added .
Qiao explained that this part of the Law on Stationing Troops is based on the fact that the troops only play an assisting role in maintaining security in the SAR and in helping disaster victims .
A key point in the regulation is that a high degree of autonomy of the SAR be maintained and that the `` one country , two systems '' policy be fully implement , Qiao said .
