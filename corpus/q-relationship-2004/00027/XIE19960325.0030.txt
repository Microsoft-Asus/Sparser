HARARE , March 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Zimbabwean government moved fast on Monday to diffuse a latest health scare over the mad cow disease and assured the nation of total protection from the scourge threatening to ground British beef industry to a halt .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Veterinary Services Department Deputy Director Welbourne Madzima said today several measures including strict import controls had been effected to rule out chances of the disease spreading to Zimbabwe from Britain .</ENAMEX>
`` There is no need for people to start panicking , we are monitoring the situation , '' Madzima said .
The move came in the wake of reports that neighboring South Africa which is Britain 's most valuable export market outside Europe , last Friday joined other countries banning import of the meat because of fears of the mad cow disease .
Zimbabwe is a net exporter of beef and does not import the commodity .
Madzima said Zimbabwe also did not import live cattle from the UK , but semen and embryos subjected to strict veterinary import controls .
`` We emphasize that the beast from which the semen of the embryo is extracted must be free of any infectious disease , '' Madzima said .
In addition , Madzima said local cattle which died from any nervous disorders were thoroughly examined to rule out the bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- mad cow disease .
`` to-date our tests have ruled out any suspicions of the BSE locally , '' Madzima added .
