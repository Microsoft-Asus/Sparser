A CLOSER LOOK AT NATURAL SELECTION AS THE MECHANISM OF ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION

 

 Evolutionary fitness is the relative contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation



 

 The effect of selection on a varying characteristic can be directional, diversifying, or stabilizing



 

 Natural selection maintains sexual reproduction



 

 Sexual selection may lead to pronounced secondary differences between the sexes



 

 Natural selection cannot fashion perfect organisms



Adaptive evolution is a blend of chance and sorting--chance in the creation of new genetic variations by mutation and sexual recombination, and sorting in the workings of selection as it favors the propagation of some chance variations over others. From the range of variations available to it, natural selection increases the frequencies of certain genotypes and fits organisms to their environments. In this section, we take a closer look at natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary adaptation.
