 Plants require nine macronutrients and at least eight micronutrients

A particular chemical element is considered an essential nutrient if it is required for a plant to grow from a seed and complete the life cycle, producing another generation of seeds. Researchers can use a method known as hydroponic culture to determine which of the mineral elements are actually essential nutrients (FIGURE 37.2). Such studies have helped identify 17 elements that are essential nutrients in all plants and a few other elements that are essential to certain groups of plants. Most research has involved crop plants; little is known about the specific nutritional needs of uncultivated plants, even some of the most commercially important conifers that provide lumber.

Fig 37-2. Using hydroponic culture to identify essential nutrients. A researcher bathes the roots of plants in solutions of various minerals dissolved in known concentrations. Aerating the water provides the roots with oxygen for cellular respiration. A particular mineral, such as potassium, can be omitted from the culture medium to test whether it is essential to the plants. If the element deleted from the mineral solution is an essential nutrient, then the incomplete medium will cause plants to become abnormal in appear-ance compared with controls grown on a complete mineral medium. The most common symptoms of a mineral deficiency are stunted growth and discolored leaves.

Elements required by plants in relatively large amounts are called macronutrients. There are nine macronutrients in all, including the six major ingredients of organic compounds: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The other three macronutrients are potassium, calcium, and magnesium. (TABLE 37.1 lists some of their functions.)

The eight micronutrients are iron, chlorine, copper, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, boron, and nickel. These elements function in plants mainly as cofactors of enzymatic reactions (see Chapter 6). Iron, for example, is a metallic component of cytochromes, the proteins that function in the electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is because micronutrients generally play catalytic roles that plants need only minute quantities of these elements. The requirement for molybdenum, for example, is so modest that there is only one atom of this rare element for every 16 million atoms of hydrogen in dried plant material. Yet a deficiency of molybdenum or any other micronutrient can weaken or kill a plant.
