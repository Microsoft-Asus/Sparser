THE MAMMALIAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

 

 The oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus initiate food processing



 

 The stomach stores food and performs preliminary digestion



 

 The small intestine is the major organ of digestion and absorption



 

 Hormones help regulate digestion



 

 Reclaiming water is a major function of the large intestine



The general principles of food processing are similar for a diversity of animals, so we can use the digestive system of mammals as a representative example. The mammalian digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and various accessory glands that secrete digestive juices into the canal through ducts. Peristalsis, rhythmic waves of contraction by smooth muscles in the wall of the canal, pushes the food along the tract. At some of the junctions between specialized segments of the digestive tube, the muscular layer is modified into ringlike valves called sphincters, which close off the tube like drawstrings, regulating the passage of material between chambers of the canal. The accessory glands of the mammalian digestive system are three pairs of salivary glands, the pancreas, the liver, and the gallbladder, which stores a digestive juice.

Using the human digestive system as a model, we now follow a meal through the alimentary canal, seeing in more detail what happens to the food in each of the processing stations along the way (FIGURE 41.13).

After chewing and swallowing, it takes only 5 to 10 seconds for food to pass down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it spends 2 to 6 hours being partially digested. Final digestion and nutrient absorption occur in the small intestine over a period of 5 to 6 hours. In 12 to 24 hours, any undigested material passes through the large intestine, and feces are expelled through the anus.
