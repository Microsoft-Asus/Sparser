MOSCOW , February 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed `` mounting concern '' over `` the armed incidents in the so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern areas of Iraq . ''
It said in a statement that the sporadic airstrikes by U.S. and British planes on Iraqi territory `` are fraught not only with serious political consequences but also -- which is absolutely inadmissible -- with human casualties , including those civilian , '' Itar - Tass reported .
The statement said the creation of the no-fly zones was a unilateral move taken without a sanction of the U.N. Security council and therefore unacceptable from the point of view of the international law .
`` The references of the United States and Great Britain to resolution 688 of the Security Council are absolutely wrongful , '' the ministry said .
It warned that U.S. and British attempt to instigate armed uprisings against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein against the background of systematic bombings `` is a dangerous game fraught with a threat to the preservation of the Iraqi statehood and a disintegration of the country which can have unpredictable consequences for the whole region . ''
Russia urged all sides to `` show restraint and prevent a further aggravation of the situation , primarily to stop the military activity in the skies of Iraq . ''
`` It is now important as never before to create a favorable political atmosphere for further diplomatic efforts , primarily within the framework of the Security Council , to agree on a mutually acceptable platform for restoring the cooperation between the U.N. and Iraq and lifting economic sanctions on that country , '' the statement said .
