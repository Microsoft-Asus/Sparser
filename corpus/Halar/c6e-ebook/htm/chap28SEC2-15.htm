They are commonly reddish because of an accessory pigment called phycoerythrin. It belongs to a family of pigments known as phycobilins, also found in cyanobacteria. In fact, the plastids of red algae evolved from cyanobacteria by primary endosymbiosis.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Despite their name, not all rhodophytes are red. Species adapted to different water depths differ in their proportions of accessory pigments. Rhodophytes may be almost black in deep water, bright red at more moderate depths, and greenish in very shallow water because less phycoerythrin masks the green of chlorophyll. Some species lack pigmentation altogether and function heterotrophically as parasites on other red algae.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Red algae are the most abundant large algae in the warm coastal waters of tropical oceans, but there are also some freshwater and soil species. The phycobilins and other accessory pigments allow some species to absorb the light wavelengths (blues and greens) that penetrate down to deep water. A species of red alga has recently been discovered living near the Bahamas at a depth of more than 260 m.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Most red algae are multicellular, and the largest share the designation "seaweeds" with the brown algae, although none of the reds are as big as the giant browns (kelps). The thalli of many red algae are filamentous, often branched and interwoven in delicate lacy patterns (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.22</span>). The base of the thallus is usually differentiated as a simple holdfast.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-22','../fig/big/fig28-22.jpg','fig28-22');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-22.jpg" alt="fig28-22" name="myfig28-22"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-22.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Red algae.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Life cycles are especially diverse among the red algae.
