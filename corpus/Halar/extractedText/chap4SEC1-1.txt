THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON

 

 Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds



 

 Carbon atoms are the most versatile building blocks of molecules



 

 Variation in carbon skeletons contributes to the diversity of organic molecules



Although a cell is composed of 70-95%  water, the rest consists mostly of carbon-based compounds. Proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, and other molecules that distinguish living matter from inanimate material are all composed of carbon atoms bonded to one another and to atoms of other elements. Hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P) are other common ingredients of these compounds, but it is carbon (C) that accounts for the large diversity of biological molecules.
