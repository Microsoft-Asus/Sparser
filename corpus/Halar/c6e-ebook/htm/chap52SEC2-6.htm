No population--neither bacteria nor elephants nor any other organisms--can grow exponentially indefinitely. As any population grows larger in size, its increased density may influence the ability of individuals to harvest sufficient resources for maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Populations subsist on a finite amount of available resources, and as the population becomes more crowded, each individual has access to an increasingly smaller share. Ultimately, there is a limit to the number of individuals that can occupy a habitat. Ecologists define <span class="Emphasis2">carrying capacity</span> as the maximum population size that a particular environment can support at a particular time with no degradation of the habitat. Carrying capacity, symbolized as <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>, is not fixed, but varies over space and time with the abundance of limiting resources. For example, the carrying capacity for bats may be high in a habitat where flying insects are abundant and there are caves for roosting but lower in a habitat where food is abundant but suitable shelters are less common. Energy limitation is one of the most significant determinants of carrying capacity, although other factors, such as shelters, refuges from predators, soil nutrients, water, and suitable nesting and roosting sites, can be limiting.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Crowding and resource limitation can have a profound effect on the population growth rate. If individuals cannot obtain sufficient resources to reproduce, per capita birth rate will decline. If they cannot find and consume enough energy to maintain themselves, per capita death rates may also increase. A decrease in <span class="Emphasis1">b</span> or an increase in <span class="Emphasis1">d</span> results in a smaller <span class="Emphasis1">r</span> and a lower overall rate of population growth.</p><p class="Header3">The Logistic Growth Equation</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">We can modify our mathematical model of population growth to incorporate changes in growth rate as the population size nears the carrying capacity (as <span class="Emphasis1">N</span> grows toward <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>). The <span class="Emphasis2">logistic population growth</span> model incorporates the effect of population density on the per capita rate of increase, allowing this rate to vary from a maximum at low population size to zero as carrying capacity is reached. When a population’s size is below the carrying capacity, population growth is rapid, but as <span class="Emphasis1">N</span> approaches <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>, population growth slows down.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Mathematically, we construct the logistic model by starting with the model of exponential population growth and creating an expression that reduces the rate of population increase as <span class="Emphasis1">N</span> increases (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.10</span>).

These experimental populations are grown in a constant environment lacking predators and other species that may compete for resources, conditions that rarely occur in nature. Even under these laboratory conditions, not all populations show logistic growth patterns. Laboratory populations of water fleas (<span class="Emphasis1">Daphnia</span>)<span class="Emphasis1"></span>, for example, show exponential growth and overshoot their carrying capacity before settling down to a relatively stable density (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.12b</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig52-12','../fig/big/fig52-12.jpg','fig52-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig52-12.jpg" alt="fig52-12" name="myfig52-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 52-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">How well do these populations fit the logistic population growth model?</span> The dots on these graphs are the actual data points.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para40"></a><p class="BlockText">Most populations show some deviations from a smooth sigmoid curve. And while many natural populations increase in approximately logistic fashion, the stable carrying capacity is rarely observed. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.12c</span> shows population changes in the song sparrow on a small island in southern British Columbia. The population increases rapidly but suffers periodic catastrophes in winter, so that there is no stable population size.</p><a name="para41"></a><p class="BlockText">Some of the basic assumptions built into the logistic model clearly do not apply to all populations. For example, the model incorporates the idea that even at low population levels, each individual added to the population has the same negative effect on population growth rate. Some populations, however, show an <span class="Emphasis1">Allee effect</span> (named after W. C. Allee, of the University of Chicago, who first described it), in which individuals may have a more difficult time surviving or reproducing if the population size is too small. For example, a single plant standing alone may suffer from excessive wind but would be protected in a clump of individuals. And some seabirds that breed in colonies require large numbers at their breeding grounds to provide the necessary social stimulation for reproduction. Moreover, conservation biologists fear that populations of solitary animals, such as rhinoceroses, may become so small that individuals will not be able to locate mates in the breeding season. In all these cases, a greater number of individuals in the population has a positive effect, up to a point, on population growth, rather than a negative effect as assumed by the logistic model.</p><a name="para42"></a><p class="BlockText">The logistic model also makes the assumption that populations adjust instantaneously and approach carrying capacity smoothly. In most natural populations, however, there is a lag time before the negative effects of an increasing population are realized. For example, as some important resource, such as food, becomes limiting for a population, reproduction will be reduced, but the birth rate may not be affected immediately because the organisms may use their energy reserves to continue producing eggs for a short time. This may cause the population to overshoot the carrying capacity. Eventually, deaths will exceed births, and the population may then drop below carrying capacity; even though reproduction begins again as numbers fall, there is a delay until new individuals actually appear. Many populations fluctuate strongly, which makes it difficult to define what is meant by carrying capacity (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.12c</span>). Others overshoot it at least once before attaining a relatively stable size (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 52.12b</span>). We will examine some possible reasons for these fluctuations later in the chapter.</p><a name="para43"></a><p class="BlockText">As you will see in the next section, some populations do not necessarily remain at, or even reach, levels where population density is an important factor. In many insects and other small, quickly reproducing organisms that are sensitive to environmental fluctuations, physical variables such as temperature or moisture usually reduce the population well before resources become limiting.</p><a name="para44"></a><p class="BlockText">Overall, the logistic model is a useful starting point for thinking about how populations grow and for constructing more complex models. Although it fits few, if any, real populations closely, the logistic model is useful in conservation biology and in pest control to estimate how rapidly a particular population might increase in numbers after it has been reduced to a small size. And like any good starting hypothesis, the logistic model has stimulated much research and many discussions that, whether they support the model or not, lead to a greater understanding of the factors affecting population growth.</p><p class="Header3">The Logistic Population Growth Model and Life Histories</p><a name="para45"></a><p class="BlockText">The logistic model predicts different growth rates for low-density populations and high-density populations, relative to the carrying capacity of the environment. At high densities, each individual has few resources available, and the population can grow slowly, if at all. At low densities, the opposite is true: Resources per capita are relatively abundant, and the population can grow rapidly. Different life history features will be favored under these different conditions. At high population density, selection favors adaptations that enable organisms to survive and reproduce with few resources. Thus, competitive ability and maximum efficiency of resource utilization should be favored in populations that are at or near their carrying capacity. At low population density, on the other hand, even in the same species, the "empty" environment should favor adaptations that promote rapid reproduction. Increased fecundity and earlier maturity, for example, would be selected for.</p><a name="para46"></a><p class="BlockText">Thus, the life history traits that natural selection favors may vary with population density and environmental conditions. Selection for life history traits that are sensitive to population density can be called <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">K</span>-selection,</span> or density-dependent selection. In contrast, selection for life history traits that maximize reproductive success in uncrowded environments (low densities) can be called <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">r</span>-selection,</span> or density-independent selection. These names follow from the variables of the logistic equation. <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>-selection tends to maximize population size and operates in populations living at a density near the limit imposed by their resources (the carrying capacity <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>). By contrast, <span class="Emphasis1">r</span>-selection tends to maximize <span class="Emphasis1">r</span>, the rate of increase, and occurs in variable environments in which population densities fluctuate well below carrying capacity or in open habitats where individuals are likely to face little competition.</p><a name="para47"></a><p class="BlockText">In laboratory experiments, researchers have shown that different populations of the same species may show a different balance of <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>-selected and <span class="Emphasis1">r</span>-selected traits, depending on conditions. For example, cultures of the fruit fly <span class="Emphasis1">Drosophila melanogaster</span> raised under crowded conditions with minimal food for 200 generations are more productive at high density than populations raised in uncrowded conditions with maximal food. Larvae from cultures selected for living in crowded conditions feed faster than larvae selected for living in uncrowded cultures. The fruit fly genotypes that are most fit at low density do not have high fitness at high density, as predicted by <span class="Emphasis1">r-</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">K</span>- selection theory.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
