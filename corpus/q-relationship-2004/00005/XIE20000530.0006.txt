COLOMBO , May 29 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering Monday reiterated his country 's position that Sri Lankan ethnic conflicts must be resolved through a negotiated political solution .
Pickering , who is on a one-day visit to the island country , called on Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga , Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and leader of the opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe .

Sri Lanka has long been plagued by ethnic conflicts between the majority Sinhalese -dominated government and Tamil Tiger rebels who have been fighting for a separate state in the country 's north and east since 1983 .
In recent weeks , rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- launched a fierce attack on government troops in a bid to recapture their former stronghold of the Jaffna peninsula which they lost in 1996 .
`` The relevance of the facilitation process undertaken by Norway , with the aim of bringing the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE together for negotiations in this regard , was emphasized , '' said the statement .
It said Pickering had appreciated the detailed exposition he received of Sri Lanka 's efforts to resolve the ethnic question within the country 's democratic framework .
Pickering arrived here early Monday morning after his visits to India and Pakistan .
In New Delhi he held discussions with the Indian government on the situation in Sri Lanka .
He was also joined at those discussions by Norway 's Foreign State Secretary Raymond Johansen who was in Colombo last week continuing his country 's mediatory role .
