GENOME ORGANIZATION AT THE DNA LEVEL

 

 Repetitive DNA and other noncoding sequences account for much of a eukaryotic genome



 

 Gene families have evolved by duplication of ancestral genes



 

 Gene amplification, loss, or rearrangement can alter a cell's genome during an organism's lifetime



Now we are ready to examine how genes and other DNA sequences are organized within the genome. Because most of this unit has focused on genes, you may be surprised to learn that genes make up only a tiny portion of the genomes of most multicellular eukaryotes.
