Freeh , in Australia giving advice on law and order issues , made his comments on Channel Nine television Monday .
When asked if Sydney was at risk of attack by Bin Laden because of the large contingent of U.S. athletes and spectators attending the event , Freeh replied `` exactly . ''
`` His threat , or Fatwah , -LRB- is -RRB- against not only Americans but the friends of America who we believe are clearly most of the world , and certainly our very close friends here in this part of the world , '' Freeh said .
`` So I think the Olympics , APEC , the America 's Cup -- these are all opportunities for someone who has a terrorist agenda to take advantage of an opportunity . ''
