Before we look at these events, we must return to class I MHC proteins and their role in presenting antigen to cytotoxic T cells. Recall that all nucleated cells of the body continuously produce class I MHC molecules. As a newly synthesized class I molecule moves toward the cell surface, it captures a small fragment of one of the other proteins synthesized by that cell. If that cell happens to contain a replicating virus, peptide fragments of viral proteins are captured and transported to the cell surface. In this way, class I MHC molecules expose foreign proteins that are synthesized in infected or abnormal cells to cytotoxic T cells. The interaction between the antigen-presenting infected cell and a cytotoxic T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called <span class="Emphasis2">CD8.</span> Present on most cytotoxic T cells, CD8 binds to a portion of the class I MHC molecule. The CD8-class I MHC interaction helps keep the two cells in contact while activation of the T<SUB>C</SUB> cell is occurring (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.12</span>). Thus, the roles of class I MHC molecules and CD8 are similar to those of class II MHC molecules and CD4, except that different cells are involved.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig43-12a','../fig/big/fig43-12a.jpg','fig43-12a');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig43-12a.jpg" alt="fig43-12a" name="myfig43-12a"></a><br>a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig43-12b','../fig/big/fig43-12b.jpg','fig43-12b');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig43-12b.jpg" alt="fig43-12b" name="myfig43-12b"></a><br>b.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 43-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The functioning of cytotoxic T cells.

As ions and water flow into the target cell, it swells and eventually lyses (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 43.12a</span>). The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce but also exposes it to circulating antibodies, which mark it for disposal.

Because tumor cells carry distinctive molecules not found on normal cells, they are identified as foreign by the immune system. Class I MHC molecules on a tumor cell present fragments of <span class="Emphasis2">tumor antigen</span> to T<SUB>C</SUB> cells. Interestingly, certain cancers and viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus) actively reduce the amount of class I MHC protein on affected cells so that they escape detection by T<SUB>C</SUB> cells. The body has a backup defense: Natural killer (NK) cells, part of the body's nonspecific defenses, also lyse virus-infected and cancer cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
