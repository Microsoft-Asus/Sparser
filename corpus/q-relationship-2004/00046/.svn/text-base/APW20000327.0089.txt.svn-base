GROZNY , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Small rebel bands attacked Russian posts in Chechnya on Monday , and Russian jets bombed rebel targets in areas the military had claimed to control , indicating weaknesses in the Russians ' grip on the republic .
The attacks came despite heightened security for Russia 's presidential election Sunday , and cast doubt on the military 's claim to control most of Chechnya .
Rebels shot grenades at a police checkpoint near Urus - Martan , 12 miles southwest of the Chechen capital Grozny , drawing Russian fire , the ITAR - Tass news agency quoted the military command as saying .
Snipers also attacked a police headquarters in Urus - Martan .
Militants also ambushed a police checkpoint in Shali , 16 miles southeast of Grozny , ITAR - Tass said .
No casualty information was available .
Russian jets flew more than 90 attack sorties in the past 24 hours , the federal command said Monday .
The jets targeted the towns of Samashki , Roshni - Chu and Elistanzhi , all in Russian -held areas .
The heaviest fighting recently has been in the southern mountains , where hundreds of rebels are based , but smaller clashes have been reported in the Russian -held northern flatlands .
The military claimed Monday to have 1,500 rebels trapped in the village of Tsentoroi , 30 miles southeast of Grozny .
It maintained no fighting had begun but said Russian troops were preparing for battle .
Only a small part of the votes in the presidential election had been counted in Chechnya by Monday , but preliminary results indicated nationwide winner Vladimir Putin received 40 percent of the vote .
Putin was followed by Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov with 32 percent , said Sergei Yastrzhembsky , the presidential spokesman on Chechnya .
Nationwide , Putin won more than 52 percent of the vote , to Zyuganov 's 30 percent .
Placing third in Chechnya was ethnic Chechen Umar Dzhabrailov , a Moscow businessman .
He got 12.7 percent in Chechnya , but less than 1 percent nationwide .
Russian officials and the head of Chechnya 's electoral commission , Abdul - Kerim Arsakhanov , denied any foul play .
But some election officials suggested the results could have been rigged in Putin 's favor .

Streets in Chechen towns and cities were bare on election day , with few voters going to the polls .
But Yastrzhembsky said in Moscow that turnout in the republic was 65 percent .
Officials reported only two polling station incidents .
A bomb was defused at a polling station in the eastern village of Engel - Yurt , and a grenade launcher was fired at a polling station in the town of Argun , east of Grozny , Yastrzhembsky said .
Nobody was injured .
`` The main thing is that despite the multiple threats and risks , the election took place , '' Yastrzhembsky said .
`` For the first time in many years , the citizens of Chechnya alongside with the Russians took part in an electoral process . ''
President Clinton congratulated Putin on Monday , but used the opportunity to express U.S. dismay over the situation in ravaged Chechnya .
In a statement , Clinton said he stressed the U.S. view that Russia must launch `` investigations of reported human rights violations '' in Chechnya , and allow full access to the region for international relief organizations and the press .
Chechnya won de facto independence after a 1994-6 war that ended in a humiliating withdrawal for Russian troops .
Russian forces entered Chechnya again last September , after rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan .
