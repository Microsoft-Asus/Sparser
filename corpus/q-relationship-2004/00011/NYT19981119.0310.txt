Curiosity seekers will be tuning to ABC Sunday to see how Christopher Reeve fares in his first acting role since being paralyzed in 1995 .
They should be immensely pleased .
Relying only on facial expressions and an unpredictable voice , Reeve is solid and convincing in Hallmark Entertainment 's remake of `` Rear Window . ''
But others intent on making a comparison between this version and Alfred Hitchcock 's 1954 masterwork about voyeurism will not be impressed .
Aside from Reeve 's gutsy performance , the view from this `` Rear Window '' is unsatisfying .
It 's as if director Jeff Bleckner -LRB- `` Serving in Silence : The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story '' -RRB- spent so much energy focusing on Reeve 's comeback that he forgot to create a complete story .
As an executive producer , Reeve also deserves some blame for using the project as a platform to raise awareness about the abilities of people with spinal-cord injuries .
He 's not the first to act from a pulpit , but in choosing `` Rear Window '' as the vehicle Reeve has tinkered with the essence of a fine story and rendered it very dull .
The brilliance of Hitchcock 's film lay in the claustrophobic sense he created by shooting virtually every scene in the protagonist 's tiny apartment .
Bleckner , on the other hand , chooses to venture outside , especially at the beginning , to establish how Reeve 's character , Jason Kemp , becomes paralyzed .
In doing so he wastes precious time and ultimately fails on two key fronts : He never gives viewers time to make up their own mini-stories about the neighbors that Jason is spying upon , and he never gives the supporting players enough time to make an impact .
Daryl Hannah , for instance , is amazingly graceless in the role Grace Kelly made memorable nearly a half-century ago .
In a role that did n't offer much screen time , Kelly managed to convey the complexities of Lisa xr mont : sophisticated socialite , vulnerable girlfriend , scheming collaborator , mischievous adventurer .
No such luck this time .
Hannah 's character is named Claudia Henderson and she is not a girlfriend -- yet -- but rather a co-worker of Jason 's .
Both are architects , and Claudia has taken on Jason 's biggest project while he recuperates from the car accident that made him a quadriplegic .
Jason is clearly vexed when he returns home to a specially modified -- and hardly claustrophobic -- tri-level condo that has enough high-tech assistive gadgetry to send his wheelchair to the ninth ring of Saturn .
Though energized and motivated by six months at a rehab center , Jason is not a completely happy camper .
He thinks his partners have rendered him useless by farming out his prized project to Claudia , a junior associate whose motives he does n't trust .
We 're to assume here that Jason has so much time on his hands that he gives in to his Mr. Peepers tendencies and starts spying on neighbors across the way .
But in updating Cornell Woolrich 's original story , screenwriters Eric Overmeyer and Larry Gross have weakened it considerably , and perhaps unwittingly .
Hitchock 's 1954 protagonist , played by Jimmy Stewart , is L.B. Jeffries , a magazine photographer who ca n't work because of a broken leg .
Cranky and bored , he takes to watching the neighbors to pass the time and ends up convincing himself that he has witnessed a murder in the apartment building across from his .
Same thing happens to Jason Kemp in the remake .
But since his income allows him everything he needs to continue working , including voice-actuated computer and live-in assistant , the voyeur-out-of-ennui scenario is hard to swallow , especially with Claudia coming by daily to consult on work-related projects .
Hannah does n't help , offering a performance that is remarkable only for its complete lack of emotion , even as Claudia buys into Jason 's theory and becomes his willing accomplice in bringing down the bad guy .
Robert Forster , meanwhile , is simply underused as police detective Charlie Moore , leaving to carry the entire film .
Where the original `` Rear Window '' is stylish , sexy , funny and scary , Sunday 's remake gets maybe half a point for scary -- when the suspect confronts Jason -- but it comes up short on the other three .
Even more disappointing : In order to show `` Rear Window '' as a November sweeps stunt , ABC had to pre-empt `` The Practice . ''
