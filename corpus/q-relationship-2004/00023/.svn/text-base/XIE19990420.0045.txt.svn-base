UNITED NATIONS , April 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A new report on child soldiers in Africa has found that more than 120,000 children under 18 years of age are being used as soldiers across the continent , some of these children being no more than seven years of age .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The report , released here Monday by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , said the countries most affected were Algeria , Angola , Burundi , Congo - Brazzaville , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Sudan and Uganda .</ENAMEX>
`` African children are being targeted across the continent as tools fo war , '' said Reed Brody , director of Human Rights Watch , which chairs the international coalition .
He called on governments to stop recruiting children into their own armed forces and to end all support to rebel groups that used children as soldiers .
When not actively engaged in combat , children are often used to man checkpoints .
Adult soldiers tend to stand several meters further back so that if bullets start flying , the children will be the first victims , the report said .
The report , which is being published to coincide with the opening in Maputo , Mozambique , of a Regional Conference on the Use of Children as Soldiers , sources said .
The overwhelming majority of African countries have set 18 years as the minimum age for recruitment , whether voluntary or through conscription .
Notable exceptions are Angola , which recently reduced its conscription age to 17 , and Uganda , which appears to allow children over 13 years of age to enlist in certain circumstances .
South Africa , which currently accepts volunteers at 17 years , plans to raise its minimum recruitment age to 18 years in the coming months .
The conference , which is being jointly organized by the Coalition and Save the Children , a non-governmental organization , is the first of four regional conferences to be held this year .
The others will be held in Latin America , Asia and Europe .
The Maputo Conference will bring together the largest-ever gathering of African governments , non-governmental organizations , and representatives of the United Nations and the Red Cross to seek to end the use of children as soldiers .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The coalition , headed by seven international non-governmental organizations , was founded in May 1998</ENAMEX> .
