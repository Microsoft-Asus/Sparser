On a broader scale yet, the principles of community and ecosystem ecology are being brought to bear on studies of the biodiversity of whole landscapes. In an ecological sense, a <span class="Emphasis2">landscape</span> is a regional assemblage of interacting ecosystems, such as a forest or forest patches, adjacent open fields, wetlands, streams, and streamside (riparian) habitats.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Landscape ecology</span> is the application of ecological principles to the study of human land-use patterns. Understanding landscape dynamics is critically important in conservation because many species use more than one kind of ecosystem, and many live on the borders between ecosystems. The goal of landscape ecology, of which ecosystem management is part, is to understand patterns of landscape use in the past, present, and foreseeable future and to make biodiversity conservation a functional part of the picture. Such a broad view requires understanding community and ecosystem ecology as well as human population dynamics and economics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
