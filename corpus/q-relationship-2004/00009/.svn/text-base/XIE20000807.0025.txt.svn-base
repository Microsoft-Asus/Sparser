ANKARA , August 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Turkey , heavily feeling pressure of energy shortage , is making more efforts to find solutions to meet the growing energy demand which increases nearly 10 percent a year .
Following the cancellation of the tender for a nuclear plant in southern Akkuyu because of financial problem and environmental concerns , Turkey is desperately looking for alternative energy sources , with natural gas being the top option .
Turkish State Minister Suayip Usenmez said last Saturday that the cabinet was discussing a report titled `` Restructuring Works , Views , Criticisms , and Proposals in the Field of Oil and Natural Gas Under the Facts of the 21st Century . ''
The report said Turkey will mainly depend on import of oil and natural gas in the future given the country 's scarcity of oil and gas resources .
Turkey has realized that a real energy shortage will befall the country for lack of necessary measures to diversify energy types and supplying countries .
Russia , Turkmenistan , Azerbaijan and Iran are the main suppliers now .
Under the Blue Stream project signed with Russia , energy hungry Turkey will import 365 billion cubic meters of gas via a black sea pipeline of Russia in 25 years as of the year 2001 .
A pipeline linking Iran 's northwestern Tabriz to Ankara is under construction .
Under a protocol signed early this month , as of July 30 , 2001 , the pipeline will transfer 3 billion cubic metres of gas to Turkey annually .
Analysts said that the protocol cleared all obstacles to the construction of the pipeline which had been delayed due to the tense relations between the two neighbors and the U.S. opposition .
The United States has voiced opposition to the Turkish - Iranian deal on the grounds that it was a rival to the trans- Caspian pipeline .
To appease Washington , Ankara has repeatedly said the trans- Caspian pipeline is a priority .
Since the uncertainty of a pipeline project with Turkmenistan , Turkey is eying the newly-discovered Azeri natural gas reserves in the Caspian Sea .
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has recently visited Azerbaijan , highlighting the importance of Azeri gas for Turkey .
The two countries have agreed to start negotiations on transporting the gas through a pipeline adjacent to the strategic Baku - Ceyhan oil pipeline that will transport the rich Caspian oil to western markets via Turkey .
In addition , Ankara is rebuilding the Tarutina Compressor station in Ukraine to increase the capacity of the current Turkey natural gas pipeline via Ukraine and the station will be operational in the fourth quarter of this year .
By then , the transfer capacity of the pipeline will rise to 19.8 billion cubic meters from the current 16 billion cubic meters .
In a bid to diversify types of energy , the government will attach importance to the establishment of new wind , water and thermic power plants .
