PARIS , September 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- French government today decided to suspend the sale of cosmetics products containing essences of the eye , brain and marrow of cows and sheep likely to be infected with the `` mad cow '' disease .
However , the ordinance will seriously affect the local cosmetics market , because French cosmetics producers have been observing a government recommendation of not to use possible `` mad cow '' cattle essences from Britain since November 1992 , said the State Secretariat of Health .
The ordinance said that cosmetics producers containing eye , brain and marrow essences of cows older than six months , and sheep and goat more than one year old cannot be sold .
Eye , brain and marrow are considered to be the easiest parts of cattle to be infected with the `` mad cow '' disease virus .
The ordinance also bans the sale of cosmetics and body hygiene products containing essences of cattle slaughtered in Britain , no matter what age the slaughtered cattle are .
