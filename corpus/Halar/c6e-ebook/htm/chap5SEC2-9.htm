In almost every case, the function of a protein depends on its ability to recognize and bind to some other molecule. For instance, an antibody binds to a particular foreign substance that has invaded the body, and an enzyme recognizes and binds to its substrate, the substance the enzyme works on. In Chapter 2, you learned that one nerve cell in the brain signals another by dispatching specific molecules that have a unique shape. The receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell are proteins that fit the signal molecules something like a lock and key (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.18</span>).</p><p class="Header3">Four Levels of Protein Structure</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">When a cell synthesizes a polypeptide, the chain generally folds spontaneously to assume the functional conformation for that protein. This folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of a variety of bonds between parts of the chain. Thus, the function of a protein--the ability of a receptor protein to identify and associate with a particular chemical messenger, for instance--is an emergent property resulting from exquisite molecular order. In the complex architecture of a protein, we can recognize three superimposed levels of structure, known as primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. A fourth level, quaternary structure, arises when a protein consists of two or more polypeptide chains.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Primary Structure.</span> The <span class="Emphasis2">primary structure</span> of a protein is its unique sequence of amino acids. As an example, we will examine the primary structure of lysozyme, the antibacterial enzyme illustrated in its three-dimensional form in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.17</span>. Lysozyme is a relatively small protein, its single polypeptide chain only 129 amino acids long. In <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.18</span>, the polypeptide chain is unraveled for a closer look at its primary structure. A specific one of the 20 amino acids occupies each of the 129 positions along the chain. The primary structure is like the order of letters in a very long word. If left to chance, there would be 20<SUP>129</SUP> different ways of arranging amino acids into a polypeptide chain of this length. However, the precise primary structure of a protein is determined not by the random linking of amino acids, but by inherited genetic information.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-18','../fig/big/fig5-18.jpg','fig5-18');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-18.jpg" alt="fig5-18" name="myfig5-18"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 5-18.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The primary structure of a protein.</span> This is the unique amino acid sequence, or primary structure, of the enzyme lysozyme.

Normal red blood cells are disk-shaped, but in sickle-cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to crystallize, deforming some of the cells into a sickle shape (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.19</span>).

His approach was to use protein-digesting enzymes and other catalysts that break polypeptides at specific places rather than completely hydrolyzing the chains. Treatment with one of these agents cleaves a polypeptide into fragments that can be separated by a technique called chromatography. Hydrolysis with another agent breaks the polypeptide at different sites, yielding a second group of fragments. Sanger used chemical methods to determine the sequence of amino acids in these small fragments. Then he searched for overlapping regions among the pieces obtained by hydrolyzing with the different agents. Consider, for instance, two fragments with the following sequences:<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM5-1.gif">
We can deduce from the overlapping regions that the intact polypeptide contains in its primary structure the following segment:<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM5-2.gif"></p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Just as we could reconstruct this sentence from a collection of fragments with overlapping sequences of letters, Sanger and his co-workers were able, after years of effort, to reconstruct the complete primary structure of insulin. Since then, most of the steps involved in sequencing a polypeptide have been automated. However, it was Sanger’s analysis of insulin that first demonstrated what is now a fundamental axiom of molecular biology: A protein has a unique primary structure, a precise sequence of amino acids.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Secondary Structure.</span> Most proteins have segments of their polypeptide chain repeatedly coiled or folded in patterns that contribute to the protein’s overall conformation. These coils and folds, collectively referred to as <span class="Emphasis2">secondary structure,</span> are the result of hydrogen bonds at regular intervals along the polypeptide backbone (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.20</span>). Only the atoms of the backbone are involved, not the amino acid side chains. Both the oxygen and the nitrogen atoms of the backbone are electronegative, with partial negative charges (see Chapter 2). The weakly positive hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom has an affinity for the oxygen atom of a nearby peptide bond. Individually, these hydrogen bonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein. One such secondary structure is the <span class="Emphasis2"><span class="symbol">a</span> helix,</span> a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid. The regions of <span class="symbol">a</span> helix in the enzyme lysozyme are evident in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.20</span>, where one <span class="symbol">a</span> helix is enlarged to show the hydrogen bonds. Lysozyme is fairly typical of a globular protein in that it has a few stretches of <span class="symbol">a</span> helix separated by nonhelical regions.

Thus, what we call a hydrophobic interaction is actually caused by the action of water molecules, which exclude nonpolar substances as they hydrogen-bond to one another and to hydrophilic parts of the protein. Once nonpolar amino acid side chains are close together, van der Waals interactions help hold them together. Meanwhile, hydrogen bonds between polar side chains and ionic bonds between positively and negatively charged side chains also help stabilize tertiary structure. These are all weak interactions, but their cumulative effect helps give the protein a specific shape.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-22','../fig/big/fig5-22.jpg','fig5-22');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-22.jpg" alt="fig5-22" name="myfig5-22"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 5-22.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Examples of interactions contributing to the tertiary structure of a protein.</span> Hydrophobic side chains usually end up in the interior of a protein, away from water.

You already know most of the answer: A polypeptide chain of a given amino acid sequence can spontaneously arrange itself into a three-dimensional shape determined and maintained by the interactions responsible for secondary and tertiary structure. This normally occurs as the protein is being synthesized within the cell. However, protein conformation also depends on the physical and chemical conditions of the protein’s environment. If the pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other aspects of its environment are altered, the protein may unravel and lose its native conformation, a change called <span class="Emphasis2">denaturation</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.25</span>). Because it is misshapen, the denatured protein is biologically inactive. Most proteins become denatured if they are transferred from an aqueous environment to an organic solvent, such as ether or chloroform; the protein turns inside out, its hydrophobic regions changing places with its hydrophilic portions. Other denaturation agents include chemicals that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and disulfide bridges that maintain a protein’s shape. Denaturation can also result from excessive heat, which agitates the polypeptide chain enough to overpower the weak interactions that stabilize conformation. The white of an egg becomes opaque during cooking because the denatured proteins are insoluble and solidify.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig5-25','../fig/big/fig5-25.jpg','fig5-25');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig5-25.jpg" alt="fig5-25" name="myfig5-25"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 5-25.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Denaturation and renaturation of a protein.</span> High temperatures or various chemical treatments will denature a protein, causing it to lose its conformation and hence its ability to function.

One would think that by correlating the primary structures of many proteins with their conformations, it would be relatively easy to discover the rules of protein folding. Unfortunately, the protein-folding problem is not that simple. Most proteins probably go through several intermediate states on their way to a stable conformation, and looking at the "mature" conformation does not reveal the stages of folding that are required to achieve that form. However, biochemists have developed methods for tracking a protein through its intermediate stages of folding. Researchers have also discovered <span class="Emphasis2">chaperonins</span> (also called chaperone proteins), protein molecules that assist the proper folding of other proteins. Chaperonins do not actually specify the correct final structure of a polypeptide. Instead they work by keeping the new polypeptide segregated from "bad influences" in the cytoplasmic environment while it folds spontaneously.
