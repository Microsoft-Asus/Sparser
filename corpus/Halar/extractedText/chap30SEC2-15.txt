 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource

The exploding human population and its demand for space and natural resources are extinguishing plant species at an unprecedented rate. The problem is especially critical in the tropics, where more than half the human population lives and population growth is fastest. Tropical rain forests are being destroyed at a frightening pace. The most common cause of this destruction is slash-and-burn clearing of the forest for agricultural use. Fifty million acres, an area about the size of the state of Washington, are cleared each year, a rate that would completely eliminate Earth's tropical forests within 25 years. As the forest disappears, so do thousands of plant species. Extinction is irrevocable; plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource. Insects and other rain forest animals that depend on these plants are also vanishing. In all, researchers estimate that the destruction of habitat in the rain forest and other ecosystems is claiming hundreds of species each year. The toll is greatest in the tropics, because that is where most species live; but environmental assault is a generically human tendency. Europeans eliminated most of their forests centuries ago, and habitat destruction is endangering many species in North America (FIGURE 30.19).

Many people have ethical concerns about contributing to the extinction of living forms. But there are also practical reasons to be concerned about the loss of plant diversity. We depend on plants for thousands of products, including food, building materials, and medicines. TABLE 30.2 lists only a few examples of how we use the unique secondary compounds of plants (see p. 582 to review secondary compounds). So far, we have explored the potential uses of only a tiny fraction of the 250,000 known plant species. For example, almost all our food is based on the cultivation of only about two dozen species. More than 25%  of prescription drugs are extracted from plants, and many more medicinal compounds were first discovered in plants and then synthesized artificially. However, researchers have investigated fewer than 5,000 plant species as potential sources of medicine. Pharmaceutical companies were led to most of these species by local people who use the plants in preparing their traditional medicines.

TABLE 2.2, p. 37.The tropical rain forest may be a medicine chest of healing plants that could be extinct before we even know they exist. This is only one reason to value what is left of plant diversity and to search for ways to slow the loss. The solutions we propose must be economically realistic. If the goal is only profit for the short term, then we will continue to slash and burn until the forests are gone. If, however, we begin to see rain forests and other ecosystems as living treasures that can regenerate only slowly, we may learn to harvest their products at sustainable rates. What else can we do to preserve plant diversity? Few questions are as important.
