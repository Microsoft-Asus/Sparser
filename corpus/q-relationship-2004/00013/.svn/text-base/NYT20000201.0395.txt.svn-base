WASHINGTON --
The director of central intelligence , George J. Tenet , said Tuesday that he had taken `` decisive action '' last year after receiving the results of an investigation by the CIA 's inspector general into evidence that a former agency director , John M. Deutch , had mishandled classified documents .
Tenet suspended Deutch 's security clearances indefinitely last August , after receiving the results of the inspector general 's investigation .
In a statement Tuesday , responding to an article in The New York Times about the inspector general 's report , Tenet also denied that senior CIA officials had impeded an internal investigation into evidence that Deutch had placed classified documents on unclassified computers in his home .
`` The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done , decisive action was taken and steps have been implemented to improve our security process , '' Tenet said .
`` At the conclusion of the IG 's investigation last August , I made the tough decision to suspend the security clearances of my former boss and predecessor .
Copies of the IG report were provided to our congressional oversight committees at that time .
The IG report did not conclude that anyone intentionally impeded the investigation .
Had the IG any information to that effect , he would have had an obligation to refer the matter to the Justice Department .
He did not do so . ''
According to the inspector general 's report , which remains classified , senior CIA officials took actions that had the effect of delaying an initial investigation into evidence that Deutch had placed classified material on unclassified computers , potential violations of CIA rules and U.S. law .
After the material was found on Deutch 's computers as he was leaving the CIA in December 1996 , the report says officials failed to notify the Justice Department immediately that he may have broken the law .
The report also says the application of the independent counsel statute was not adequately considered by CIA officials handling the Deutch case .
It adds that `` given their failure to report to the Department of Justice on a timely basis , this in effect avoided the potential application of the independent counsel statute . ''
The Deutch case was finally referred to the Justice Department in 1998 by the CIA inspector general 's office , more than a year after CIA security officials first discovered that Deutch had placed classified material on an unclassified computer in his home .
In April 1999 Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch , according to the inspector general 's report .
A special panel has now been created inside the CIA to review the actions of officials involved in the Deutch case , officials said .
The panel was established by Tenet on the recommendation of the CIA 's inspector general .
The former CIA executive director Nora Slatkin and the former CIA general counsel Michael O'Neill , both of whom left the agency in 1997 , are cited in the report for taking actions that `` had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this matter . ''
Tenet , who was Deutch 's deputy and then acting CIA director before being named director of the agency in 1997 , is also cited in the inspector general 's report , which found that he had not acted aggressively enough at first to make sure the Deutch matter was resolved .
After Tenet suspended his security clearances last August , Deutch issued a statement expressing regret for his actions .
He said that he never considered the information on his home computers to be at risk , but said he respected Tenet 's decision to act .
