HANOI , September 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Vietnam has finalized the draft of its first commercial law and ready to submit it to the National Assembly for approval in mid- October , sources here said today .
If passed , the commercial law will cover a wide scope including definitions of free trade , healthy competition , traders and their obligations and interests , equality before the law , leading roles played by state-owned businesses , etc .
All these definitions and concepts have not been included in any legal documents in Vietnam , where numerous commercial activities are undertaken spontaneously while trade links and cooperation are set up on consensus .
After 10 years of renovation , trade in Vietnam is now fast paced .
As a result , many new trading relationships have emerged and require legal regulation and intervention in line with international commercial laws and practices .
Current legal documents in this area are mainly sub-laws such as decrees , ordinances , instructions and regulations monitoring commercial activities or relating to trading relationships .
Luu Van Dat , head of the commercial law drafting sub-committees , said the draft commercial law has been built on the basis of the current commercial ordinance with reference to commercial laws of other countries as well as surveys of Vietnam 's trading activities at present .
When it is effective , the commercial law will replace all current sub-laws in trade and ensure impartiality in commercial operations among traders .
