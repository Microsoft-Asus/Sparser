The UNP , founded in 1946 , is the main opposition party and the largest party in the country .
The UNP ruled Sri Lanka for more than 30 years on four terms -- from 1947 to 1956 , from March to July in 1960 , from 1965 to 1970 , and from 1977 to 1994 .
The UNP 's main aims are to advocate free and fair society and democratic socialism , free economic policy , independent foreign policy and non-aligned foreign policy .
The UNP was strongly in favor of adopting Sinhalese as the official language and offering state aid to denominational schools .
The UNP was led by President Ranasinghe Premadasa until his assassination in 1993 .
The party was defeated in the August 1994 general election by the People 's Alliance , a coalition at whose center is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party , which the UNP had trounced to come to power in the 1977 elections .
The party has about 700,000 members and its leader is former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe who will challenge the incumbent President Kumaratunga at Sri Lanka 's fourth presidential election on Tuesday .
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna -LRB- JVP -RRB- or People 's Liberation Front The JVP , founded in 1964 , is a leftist party which has led two violent uprisings in 1971 and between 1988 and 1990 .
It was banned following a coup attempt in 1971 , regained legal status in 1977 , banned again in August 1983 , but regained legal status in May 1988 .
The party was virtually eradicated in 1989 when its former charismatic leader Rohana Wijeweera and almost its entire politburo was wiped out by security forces .
However , the JVP has slowly reappeared and emerged as Sri Lanka ` s third largest party with a membership of 25,000 to 30,000 .
The party contested the August 1994 parliamentary elections and won one seat .
The JVP is looking for about 10 percent of the 225 seats in parliament in the next general election as it got 6.5 percent of the vote in April 's five provincial council elections and later garnered 12 percent in the Southern Provincial Council polls .
The party has fielded a candidate to contest the December 21 election with the objective of scrapping the executive presidency and ushering in a `` socialist system . ''
During the last presidential election in November 1994 the JVP candidate pulled out after obtaining a promise from People 's Alliance 's Chandrika Kumaratunga that she would abolish the all powerful presidency .
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- The LTTE , which was banned by the government in January 1998 , is the largest and most militant Tamil separatist guerrilla group in Sri Lanka with 5,000 to 6,000 fighting cadres .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The LTTE , led by Velupillai Prabhakaran , has been fighting for the creation of an independent Tamil homeland since its founding in 1972 as the Tamil New Tigers </ENAMEX>.
The LTTE has shifted its headquarters to Mullaitivu from the Jaffna peninsula , the former stronghold of the group for 10 years until the government forces retook it in 1996 .
In the run-up to the presidential election slated for Tuesday , LTTE guerrillas have intensified their offensives in the north of the country in a bid to gain more bargaining chips once the new president calls for talks after inauguration .
The LTTE is regarded as the primary obstacle to the government ' s efforts to resolve the ethnic conflicts because of its hard-line militant position and terrorist activities .
Its members are blamed for the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa and a string of other political and military leaders .
