In fact, the <span class="Emphasis2">mitotic (M) phase,</span> which includes both mitosis and cytokinesis, is usually the shortest part of the cell cycle. Mitotic cell division alternates with a much longer <span class="Emphasis2">interphase,</span> which often accounts for about 90%  of the cycle. It is during interphase that the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Interphase can be divided into subphases: the <span class="Emphasis2">G</span><SUB>1</SUB><span class="Emphasis2">phase</span> ("first gap"), the <span class="Emphasis2">S phase,</span> and the <span class="Emphasis2">G</span><SUB>2</SUB><span class="Emphasis2">phase</span> ("second gap"). During all three subphases, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase (S stands for synthesis of DNA). Thus, a cell grows (G<SUB>1</SUB>), continues to grow as it copies its chromosomes (S), grows more as it completes preparations for cell division (G<SUB>2</SUB>), and divides (M). The daughter cells may then repeat the cycle.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig12-4','../fig/big/fig12-4.jpg','fig12-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig12-4.jpg" alt="fig12-4" name="myfig12-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 12-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The cell cycle.</span> In a dividing cell, the mitotic (M) phase alternates with interphase, a growth period.
