It has been said that an oak is an acorn's way of making more acorns. Indeed, in a Darwinian view of life, the fitness of an organism is measured only by its ability to replace itself with healthy, fertile offspring. Consider the century plant (Agave) in the photograph on this page. It lives for decades without flowering, and then one spring it grows a floral stalk as tall as a telephone pole. That season the plant produces seeds and then withers and dies, its food reserves, minerals, and water spent in the formation of its massive bloom. Although not all flowering plants are as completely consumed as the century plant in leaving offspring, most of their other functions--for example, photosynthesis and growth--can be interpreted, in the broadest Darwinian sense, as mechanisms contributing to propagation. Sexual reproduction, as in the case of oak and Agave, however, is not the sole means by which flowering plants reproduce: Many species can also reproduce asexually, creating offspring that are genetically identical to themselves.

In Chapters 29 and 30, we approached plant reproduction from an evolutionary perspective, tracing the descent of angiosperms and other land plants from their aquatic ancestors, charophycean algae. In this chapter, we explore the reproductive biology of flowering plants (angiosperms) in much greater detail because they are the most important group of plants in most terrestrial ecosystems and in agriculture. In addition to examining both sexual and asexual reproduction of angiosperms, we will place plant biotechnology in the broader context of human intervention in the propagation and genetics of the angiosperm varieties we have been cultivating for millennia.

Plant biotechnology has two meanings. In the general sense, it refers to innovations in the use of plants, or of substances obtained from plants, to make products of use to humans--an endeavor that began in prehistory. Used in a more specific sense, biotechnology refers to the use of genetically modified (GM) organisms in agriculture and industry. Indeed, in the last two decades, genetic engineering has become such a powerful--some would say too powerful--force in biotechnology that the terms genetic engineering and biotechnology have become synonymous in the media. In this last section, we examine the question of how humans have altered plants to suit their purposes from the birth of agriculture to the present.





 Sporophyte and gametophyte generations alternate in the life cycles of plants: a review

In Chapter 30 you learned about the life cycle of a flowering plant from an evolutionary perspective. The life cycles of angiosperms and other plants are characterized by an alternation of generations, in which haploid (n) and diploid (2n) generations take turns producing each other (see FIGURE 29.6). The diploid plant, which is called the sporophyte, produces haploid spores by meiosis. These spores divide by mitosis, giving rise to multicellular male and female haploid plants--the gametophytes. By mitosis and cellular differentiation, the gametophytes develop and produce gametes--sperm and eggs. Fertilization results in diploid zygotes, which divide by mitosis and form new sporophytes. FIGURE 38.1 follows the main stages of the angiosperm life cycle.

Fig 38-1. Simplified overview of angiosperm life cycle. See FIGURE 30.17 for a more detailed version of the life cycle.

In angiosperms, the sporophyte is the dominant generation in the sense that it is the conspicuous plant we see. Over the course of seed plant evolution, gametophytes became reduced in size and dependent upon their sporophyte parents: Angiosperm gametophytes are the most reduced of all, consisting of only a few cells. The sporophyte also develops a reproductive structure unique to angiosperms--the flower. Male and female gametophytes develop within the anthers and ovaries, respectively, of a sporophyte flower (see FIGURE 38.1). Pollination by wind or animals brings a male gametophyte (pollen grain) to a female gametophyte; union of their gametes (fertilization) takes place within the ovary, as does the development of the seeds containing sporophyte embryos. The ovary itself becomes a fruit (another unique structure of the angiosperms).





 Flowers are specialized shoots bearing the reproductive organs of the angiosperm sporophyte

Flowers, the reproductive shoots of the angiosperm sporophyte, are typically composed of four whorls of highly modified leaves called floral organs, which are separated by very short internodes. Unlike vegetative shoots, which grow indeterminately, flowers are determinate shoots, meaning that they cease growing once the flower and fruit are formed.

The four kinds of floral organs, in sequence from the outside to the inside of the flower, are the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Their site of attachment to the stem is the receptacle (FIGURE 38.2). Stamens and carpels are the male and female reproductive organs, respectively, whereas sepals and petals are nonreproductive organs. Sepals, which enclose and protect the floral bud before it opens, are usually green and more leaflike in appearance than the other floral organs. In many angiosperms, the petals are more brightly colored than sepals and advertise the flower to insects and other pollinators.

Fig 38-2. Review of an idealized flower.

A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a terminal structure called the anther; within the anther are chambers called pollen sacs, in which pollen is produced. A carpel has an ovary at its base and a slender neck called the style. At the top of the style is a sticky structure called the stigma that serves as a landing platform for pollen. Within the ovary are one or more ovules (the number depends on the species). The flower shown in FIGURE 38.2 has a single carpel, but the flowers of many species have multiple carpels. In some species, several carpels are fused into a single structure; the result is an ovary with two or more chambers, each containing one or more ovules.

The stamen and carpels of flowers contain the sporangia, the structures where first the spores and then the gametophytes develop. The male gametophytes are sperm-producing structures called pollen grains, which form within the pollen sacs of anthers. The female gametophytes are egg-producing structures called embryo sacs, which form within the ovules in ovaries.

For the egg within the embryo sac to be fertilized, the male and female gametophytes must meet and their gametes must unite. Pollination occurs when pollen released from anthers and carried by wind or animals lands on a stigma (not necessarily on the same flower or plant). Each pollen grain produces a structure called a pollen tube, which grows down into the ovary via the style and discharges sperm into the embryo sac, resulting in fertilization of the egg (see FIGURE 38.1). The zygote gives rise to an embryo, and as the embryo grows, the ovule that contains it develops into a seed. The entire ovary, meanwhile, develops into a fruit containing one or more seeds, depending on the species. Fruits, carried by wind or by animals, help disperse seeds some distance from their source plants. If deposited in sufficiently moist soil, seeds germinate; that is, their embryos start growing into seedlings, a new generation of flowering sporophytes.

Numerous floral variations have evolved during the 130 million years of angiosperm history (FIGURE 38.3, p. 786). In certain flowers, one or more of the four basic floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--have been eliminated. Plant biologists distinguish between complete flowers, those having all four organs, and incomplete flowers, those lacking one or more of the four floral parts. For example, most grasses have incomplete flowers lacking petals.

Fig 38-3. A few examples of floral diversity. (a) Trillium. This Trillium flower is complete, meaning that sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are all present. (b) Lupines. Lupines are examples of plants with inflorescences, clusters of flowers. (c) Sunflowers. What appears in this sunflower to be a single flower is actually a collection of hundreds. The central disk of this composite inflorescence consists of tiny complete flowers. What appear to be petals ringing the central disk are actually imperfect flowers called ray flowers. (d) Hibiscus. The diverse shapes, colors, and odors of flowers also reflect adaptations to different modes of pollination. For example, Hibiscus pollinators include hummingbirds, which are attracted to the red color. (e) Maize. Maize is a monoecious species with inflorescences of carpellate (female) and staminate (male) flowers on the same individual plant. An "ear" of maize is a collection of kernels (one-seeded fruits) that develops from an inflorescence of fertilized carpellate flowers. The maize "silk" is composed of numerous long styles (left). The staminate inflorescences are the tassels (right). (f) Sagittaria. Sagittaria is dioecious, its staminate (left) and carpellate (right) flowers on separate plants.

The presence or absence of reproductive organs further distinguishes flowers. A bisexual flower (in older terminology termed a "perfect" flower) is equipped with both stamens and carpels. Complete flowers such as the Trillium shown in FIGURE 38.3a are always bisexual, because they have all four types of floral organs, but an incomplete flower that lacks sepals or petals may also be bisexual.

A unisexual flower (or "imperfect" flower in older terminology) is missing either stamens or carpels. Unisexual flowers are called staminate or carpellate, depending on which set of reproductive organs is present. If staminate and carpellate flowers are located on the same individual plant, then that plant species is said to be monoecious (from a Greek word meaning "one house"). Maize and other corn varieties are examples. The "ears" of a maize plant are derived from clusters of carpellate flowers, while the tassels consist of staminate flowers (FIGURE 38.3e). In contrast, a dioecious ("two houses") species, such as Sagittaria, has staminate flowers and carpellate flowers on separate plants (FIGURE 38.3f). Date palms are dioecious. Because dates develop only on the carpellate (female) palms, commercial date growers plant mostly carpellate individuals. A few staminate male plants provide enough pollen for hundreds of females.

In addition to these differences based on the presence of floral organs, flowers have many variations in size, shape, and color (see FIGURE 38.3). Much of this diversity represents adaptations of flowers to different animal pollinators. Indeed, the presence of animals in the environment was a key factor in angiosperm evolution (see Chapter 30).

The following concepts describe the development of angiosperm gametophytes, then trace how pollination leads to fertilization and the development of embryos, seeds, and fruits. Keep in mind, however, that there are many variations in the details of these processes, depending on the species of flowering plant.





 Male and female gametophytes develop within anthers and ovaries, respectively: Pollination brings them together

Development of the Male Gametophyte (Pollen Grain)

Within the sporangia (pollen sacs) of an anther are numerous diploid cells called microsporocytes. Each microsporocyte undergoes meiosis, forming four haploid microspores, each of which can eventually give rise to a haploid male gametophyte (FIGURE 38.4a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 38-4. The development of angiosperm gametophytes (pollen and embryo sacs). (a) Pollen grains (immature male gametophytes) develop within the sporangia (pollen sacs) of anthers at the tips of stamens. The pollen grain becomes a mature male gametophyte when its generative cell divides to form two sperm. This usually occurs after a pollen grain lands on the stigma of a carpel and the pollen tube begins to grow (see FIGURE 38.1). (b) The embryo sac (female gametophyte) develops within an ovule, itself enclosed by the ovary at the base of a carpel. Within the ovule's sporangium is a large, diploid cell called the megasporocyte. The megasporocyte in this species divides by meiosis and gives rise to four haploid cells, but only one of these survives as the megaspore. (This contrasts with pollen formation, in which all four products of meiosis go on to form gametophytes.) Three mitotic divisions of the megaspore form the embryo sac, a multicellular female gametophyte. The ovule now consists of the embryo sac along with the surrounding integuments (protective tissues).

A microspore divides once by mitosis and produces two cells, a generative cell and a tube cell. The generative cell will eventually produce sperm. The tube cell, which encloses the generative cell, will produce the pollen tube, a structure essential for sperm delivery to the egg. The two-celled structure is encased in a thick, resistant wall that becomes sculptured into an elaborate pattern unique to the particular plant species (FIGURE 38.5). Together, the two cells and their wall constitute a pollen grain, which at this stage of its development is an immature male gametophyte.

Fig 38-5. Pollen grains have tough, ornate, and distinctive walls. The resilient wall of a pollen grain protects the male gametophyte. This is ragweed pollen (colorized SEM). Because of their tough walls, pollen grains are preserved well in the fossil record. The species of fossilized pollen found in an area can provide insights into the past climates of the area.

A pollen grain becomes a mature male gametophyte when the generative cell divides by mitosis to form two sperm cells. In most species, this process occurs after the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a carpel and the pollen tube begins to form (see FIGURE 38.1).

Development of the Female Gametophyte (Embryo Sac)

Ovules, each containing a single sporangium, form within the chambers of the ovary. One cell in the sporangium of each ovule, the megasporocyte, grows and then goes through meiosis, producing four haploid megaspores (FIGURE 38.4b).

The details of the next steps vary extensively, depending on the species. In many angiosperms (such as the one illustrated in FIGURE 38.4), only one of the megaspores survives. This megaspore continues to grow, and its nucleus divides by mitosis three times, resulting in one large cell with eight haploid nuclei. Membranes then partition this mass into a multicellular female gametophyte--the embryo sac. At one end of the embryo sac are three cells: the egg cell, or female gamete, and two cells called synergids. The synergids flank the egg cell and function in the attraction and guidance of the pollen tube. At the opposite end of the embryo sac are three antipodal cells of unknown function. The remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei, are not partitioned into separate cells but share the cytoplasm of the large central cell of the embryo sac. The ovule, which will eventually become a seed, now consists of the embryo sac and the surrounding integuments (protective layers of sporophytic tissue).

Pollination

Pollination, which brings the male and female gametophytes together, is the first step in the chain of events that leads to fertilization. This step is accomplished in various ways. Some angiosperms, including grasses and many trees, use wind as a pollinating agent. They compensate for the randomness of this dispersal by releasing enormous quantities of tiny pollen grains. At certain times of the year, the air is loaded with pollen, as anyone plagued with pollen allergies can attest. Many angiosperms, however, do not rely on the aimless wind to carry pollen but interact with insects or other animals that transfer pollen directly between flowers.





 Plants have various mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization

Some flowers self-fertilize (this is called "selfing"), but the majority of angiosperms have mechanisms that make it difficult or impossible for a flower to fertilize itself. The various barriers that prevent self-fertilization contribute to genetic variety by ensuring that sperm and eggs come from different parents. (The evolutionary and ecological importance of sexual reproduction is discussed in Chapter 23.) Dioecious plants, of course, cannot self-fertilize because they are unisexual, being either staminate or carpellate. In some plants with bisexual flowers, the stamens and carpels mature at different times or are structurally arranged in such a way that it is unlikely that an animal pollinator could transfer pollen from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower (FIGURE 38.6). However, the most common anti-selfing mechanism in flowering plants is self-incompatibility, the ability of a plant to reject its own pollen and the pollen of closely related individuals. If a pollen grain from an anther happens to land on a stigma of a flower on the same plant, a biochemical block prevents the pollen from completing its development and fertilizing an egg.

Fig 38-6. "Pin" and "thrum" flower types reduce self-fertilization. Some species, such as primrose (Oenothera biennis), produce two types of flowers: "pins," which have long styles and short stamens, and "thrums," which have short styles and long stamens. An insect foraging for nectar would collect pollen on different parts of its body; pin pollen would be deposited on thrum stigmas, and vice versa.

Researchers are unraveling the molecular mechanisms of self-incompatibility. This plant response is analogous to the immune response of animals, in the sense that both are based on the ability of organisms to distinguish the cells of "self" from those of "nonself." The key difference is that the animal immune system rejects nonself, as when the system mounts a defense against a pathogen or attempts to reject a transplanted organ. Self-incompatibility in plants, in contrast, is a rejection of self.

Recognition of "self" pollen is based on genes for self-incompatibility, called S-genes (FIGURE 38.7). In a particular plant population, as many as 50 different alleles can occur at the S-locus. If a pollen grain and the carpel's stigma upon which it lands have matching alleles at the S-locus, then the pollen grain fails to initiate or complete formation of a pollen tube, and thus no fertilization occurs. The pollen grain is haploid, and it will be recognized as "self" if its one S-allele matches either of the two S-alleles of the diploid stigma.

Fig 38-7. Genetic basis of self-incompatibility. In the gene pool of a plant population, there can be dozens of alleles of the S-gene. If a pollen grain has an allele that matches an allele of the stigma upon which it lands, then a pollen tube fails to grow.

Although self-incompatibility genes are all referred to as S-loci, such genes have actually evolved independently in various plant families. As a consequence, self-recognition blocks pollen tube growth by different molecular mechanisms. In some cases, the block occurs in the pollen grain itself; this is called gametophytic self-incompatibility. For example, in some members of the tobacco, rose, and bean (legume) families, self-recognition leads to enzymatic destruction of RNA within a rudimentary pollen tube. The RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes, or RNases, are present in the style of the carpel, but apparently they can enter a pollen tube and attack its RNA only if the pollen is of a "self" type.

In other cases, the block is a response by the cells of the carpel's stigma; this is called sporophytic self-incompatibility (because the carpel is part of the sporophyte). In members of the mustard family, for example, self-recognition activates a signal-transduction pathway in epidermal cells of the stigma that prevents germination of the pollen grain (FIGURE 38.8). Recent research suggests that one of the responses of the stigma to self-pollen is the opening of aquaporins, membrane proteins that function in water transport (see Chapter 36). Uptake of additional water by the stigma cell might block pollen germination by preventing the stigma from hydrating the relatively dry pollen, a step required for growth of a pollen tube. This model of self-incompatibility will certainly evolve as researchers learn more about how certain plants reject their own pollen.

Fig 38-8. A possible mechanism of sporophytic self-incompatibility. In plants of the mustard family, there are at least two protein products of the S-locus. (The genes coding for these proteins are so tightly linked that they are inherited as though a single gene.) One of the protein products, labeled R in this diagram, is a receptor protein located in the extracellular matrix (wall) of the stigma epidermal cell. Another product of the S-locus is a protein kinase (K) embedded in the plasma membrane of the stigma cell. (A protein kinase, recall from Chapter 11, is an enzyme that activates other proteins by phosphorylating them.) These proteins interact according to the steps in this diagram of a hypothetical mechanism for self-incompatibility.

Basic research on mechanisms of self-incompatibility may lead to agricultural applications. Plant breeders sometimes hybridize different varieties of a crop plant to combine the best traits of the varieties and counter the loss of vigor that can result from excessive inbreeding (see Chapter 14). Many agriculturally important plants are self-compatible. To maximize the number of hybrid seeds, breeders currently must prevent self-fertilization by laboriously removing the anthers from the parent plants that provide the seeds. Eventually, it may be possible instead to impose self-incompatibility on crop species that are normally self-compatible.





 Double fertilization gives rise to the zygote and endosperm

After landing on a receptive stigma, a pollen grain absorbs moisture and germinates--that is, it produces a pollen tube that extends down between the cells of the style toward the ovary (FIGURE 38.9, p. 790). The generative cell divides by mitosis and forms two sperm, the male gametes. The germinated pollen grain is the mature male gametophyte. Directed by a chemical attractant, possibly calcium, the tip of the pollen tube enters the ovary, probes through the micropyle (a gap in the integuments of the ovule), and discharges its two sperm within the embryo sac.

Fig 38-9. Growth of the pollen tube and double fertilization. After a pollen grain is carried by wind or an animal to the stigma, a long pollen tube begins growing down the style toward the ovary. The tube discharges two sperm into the embryo sac of an ovule. One sperm fertilizes the egg, forming the zygote. The other combines with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac's large central cell and forms a triploid cell that will develop into a nutritive tissue called endosperm.

The events that follow are a distinctive feature of the an giosperm life cycle (shared only with a few gymnosperms, in which the process probably evolved independently). One sperm fertilizes the egg to form the zygote. The other sperm combines with the two polar nuclei to form a triploid (3n) nucleus in the center of the large central cell of the embryo sac. This large cell will give rise to the endosperm, a food-storing tissue of the seed. The union of two sperm cells with different nuclei of the embryo sac is termed double fertilization. Double fertilization ensures that the endosperm will develop only in ovules where the egg has been fertilized, thereby preventing angiosperms from squandering nutrients.

The nonreproductive tissues surrounding the embryo sac have prevented researchers from visualizing fertilization in plants. Recently, however, scientists isolated sperm cells from pollen grains and eggs from embryo sacs and observed the merging of plant gametes invitro. The first cellular event that takes place after gamete fusion is an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels of the egg, as also occurs during animal gamete fusion (see Chapter 47). Another similarity to animals is the establishment of a block to polyspermy, the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm cell. Maize (Zea mays) sperm cannot fuse with zygotes in vitro. This barrier is established as early as 45 seconds after the initial sperm fusion with the egg in maize. The block to polyspermy in animals occurs in two stages; a fast block within milliseconds reinforced by a slow block to polyspermy that requires many seconds. In the case of plants, one hypothesis for the slow block to polyspermy is a deposition of cell wall material that mechanically impedes sperm. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the fertilization envelope that leads to a slow block to polyspermy in several animal species. The opening of ion channels in the plasma membrane of the egg might also lead to a fast block to polyspermy, as occurs in several animal species (see Chapter 47).





 The ovule develops into a seed containing an embryo and a supply of nutrients

After double fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed, and the ovary develops into a fruit enclosing the seed(s). As the embryo develops from the zygote, the seed stockpiles proteins, oils, and starch. This is why seeds are such major nutrient sinks (see Chapter 36). Initially, these nutrients are stored in the endosperm, but later in seed development in many species, the storage function of the endosperm is more or less taken over by the swelling storage leaves (cotyledons) of the embryo itself.

Endosperm Development

Endosperm development usually precedes embryo development. After double fertilization, the triploid nucleus of the ovule's central cell divides, forming a multinucleate "supercell" having a milky consistency. This liquid mass, the endosperm, becomes multicellular when cytokinesis partitions the cytoplasm by forming membranes between the nuclei. Eventually, these "naked" cells produce cell walls, and the endosperm becomes solid. Coconut "milk" is an example of liquid endosperm; coconut "meat" is an example of solid endosperm.

The endosperm is rich in nutrients, which it provides to the developing embryo. In most monocots and some dicots, the endosperm also stores nutrients that can be used by the seedling after germination. In many dicots (including bean seeds), the food reserves of the endosperm are completely exported to the cotyledons (seed leaves) before the seed completes its development, and consequently the mature seed lacks endosperm.

Embryo Development

The first mitotic division of the zygote is transverse, splitting the fertilized egg into a basal cell and a terminal cell (FIGURE 38.10). The terminal cell eventually gives rise to most of the embryo. The basal cell continues to divide transversely, producing a thread of cells called the suspensor, which anchors the embryo to its parent. The suspensor functions in the transfer of nutrients to the embryo from the parent plant and, in some plants, from the endosperm. Meanwhile, the terminal cell divides several times and forms a spherical proembryo attached to the suspensor. The cotyledons (seed leaves) begin to form as bumps on the proembryo. A dicot, with its two cotyledons, is heart-shaped at this stage. Only one cotyledon develops in monocots.

Fig 38-10. The development of a dicot plant embryo. By the time the ovule becomes a mature seed and the integuments harden and thicken to form the seed coat, the zygote has given rise to an embryonic plant with rudimentary organs.

Soon after the rudimentary cotyledons appear, the embryo elongates. Cradled between the cotyledons is the apical meristem of the embryonic shoot. At the opposite end of the embryo's axis, where the suspensor attaches, is the apex of the embryonic root, also with a meristem. After the seed germinates, the apical meristems at the tips of shoot and root will sustain primary growth as long as the plant lives (see Chapter 35). The three primary meristems--protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium--are also present in the embryo. Thus, development of the embryo establishes two features of plant form: the root-shoot axis, with meristems at opposite ends; and a radial pattern of protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium, set to give rise to the three tissue systems (dermal, ground, and vascular tissues).

Structure of the Mature Seed

During the last stages of its maturation, the seed dehydrates until its water content is only about 5-15%  of its weight. The embryo, surrounded by its enlarged cotyledons or endosperm, or both, stops growing until the seed germinates. The embryo and its food supply are enclosed by a protective seed coat formed from the integuments of the ovule.

We can take a closer look at one type of dicot seed by splitting open the seed of a common bean. At this stage, the embryo consists of an elongate structure, the embryonic axis, attached to fleshy cotyledons (FIGURE 38.11a, p. 792). Below the point at which the cotyledons are attached, the embryonic axis is called the hypocotyl (from the Greek hypo, "under"). The hypocotyl terminates in the radicle, or embryonic root. The portion of the embryonic axis above the cotyledons is the epicotyl (from the Greek epi, "on" or "over"). At its tip is the plumule, consisting of the shoot tip with a pair of miniature leaves.

Fig 38-11. Seed structure.

The cotyledons of the common bean are fleshy before the seed germinates because they absorbed food from the endosperm when the seed developed. However, the seeds of some dicots, such as castor beans (Ricinus communis), retain their food supply in the endosperm and have cotyledons that are very thin (FIGURE 38.11b). The cotyledons will absorb nutrients from the endosperm and transfer them to the embryo when the seed germinates.

The seed of a monocot has a single cotyledon (FIGURE 38.11c). Members of the grass family, including maize and wheat, have a specialized type of cotyledon called a scutellum (L. scutella, "small shield," a reference to the scutellum's shape). The scutellum is very thin, with a large surface area pressed against the endosperm, from which the scutellum absorbs nutrients during germination. The embryo of a grass seed is enclosed by two sheathes, a coleorhiza, which covers the young root, and a coleoptile, which covers the young shoot.





 The ovary develops into a fruit adapted for seed dispersal

As the seeds are developing from ovules, the ovary of the flower is developing into a fruit, which protects the enclosed seeds and aids in their dispersal by wind or animals. Pollination triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to begin its transformation into a fruit (FIGURE 38.12). If a flower has not been pollinated, fruit usually does not develop, and the entire flower withers and falls away.

Fig 38-12. Development of a pea fruit (pod). (Also, see FIGURE 30.15.) These photographs illustrate the changes in a pea plant leading to pod formation. (a) Soon after pollination, (b) the flower drops its petals, and hormonal changes make the ovary start growing. The ovary expands, and its wall thickens, (c) forming the pod, or fruit.

During fruit development, the wall of the ovary becomes the pericarp, the thickened wall of the fruit. As the ovary grows, the other parts of the flower wither and are shed. (The pointed tip of the pea pod in FIGURE 38.12 is the withered remains of the pea flower's stigma.) However, in some angiosperms, other floral parts also contribute to what we call a fruit in grocery store vernacular. In apple flowers, for example, the ovary is embedded in the receptacle (see FIGURE 38.2), and the fleshy part of the fruit is derived mainly from the swollen receptacle; only the core of the apple fruit develops from the ovary. Fruits are classified into several types, depending on their developmental origin (see TABLE 30.1).

The fruit usually ripens about the same time that its seeds are completing their development. For a dry fruit such as a soybean pod, ripening is little more than senescence (aging) of the fruit tissues, which allows the fruit to open and release the seeds. The ripening of a fleshy fruit is more elaborate, its steps controlled by the complex interactions of hormones. In this case, ripening results in an edible fruit that serves as an enticement to the animals that help spread the seeds. The "pulp" of the fruit becomes softer as a result of enzymes digesting components of the cell walls. There is usually a color change from green to some other color such as red, orange, or yellow. The fruit becomes sweeter as organic acids or starch molecules are converted to sugar, which may reach a concentration of as much as 20%  in a ripe fruit.

By selectively breeding plants, humans have capitalized on the production of edible fruits. The apples, oranges, and other fruits in grocery stores are exaggerated versions of much smaller natural varieties of fleshy fruits. However, the staple foods for humans are the dry, wind-dispersed fruits of grasses, which are harvested while still on the parent plant. The cereal grains of wheat, rice, maize, and other grasses are easily mistaken for seeds, but each is actually a fruit with a dry pericarp that adheres tightly to the seed coats of the single seed within.





 Evolutionary adaptations of seed germination contribute to seedling survival

As a seed matures, it dehydrates and enters a phase referred to as dormancy (from the Latin word meaning "to sleep"), a condition of extremely low metabolic rate and a suspension of growth and development. A plant resumes the growth and development that were temporarily suspended when the seed and its embryo became dormant. Conditions required to break dormancy vary between plant species. Some seeds germinate as soon as they are in a suitable environment. Other seeds remain dormant and will not germinate, even if sown in a favorable place, until a specific environmental cue causes them to break dormancy.

Seed Dormancy

Seed dormancy increases the chances that germination will occur at a time and place most advantageous to the seedling. Breaking dormancy generally requires certain environmental conditions. Seeds of many desert plants, for instance, germinate only after a substantial rainfall. If they were to germinate after mild drizzle, the soil might soon be too dry to support the seedlings. Where natural fires are common, many seeds require intense heat to break dormancy; seedlings are therefore most abundant after fire has cleared away competing vegetation. Where winters are harsh, seeds may require extended exposure to cold; seeds sown during summer or fall do not germinate until the following spring. This assures a long growth season before the next winter. Very small seeds, such as those of some lettuce varieties, require light for germination and will break dormancy only if they are buried shallow enough for the seedlings to poke through the soil surface. Some seeds have coats that must be weakened by chemical attack as they pass through an animal's digestive tract, and thus are likely to be carried some distance before germinating.

The length of time a dormant seed remains viable and capable of germinating varies from a few days to decades or even longer, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Most seeds are durable enough to last a year or two until conditions are favorable for germinating. Thus, the soil has a pool of nongerminated seeds that may have accumulated for several years. This is one reason vegetation reappears so rapidly after a fire, drought, flood, or some other environmental disruption.

From Seed to Seedling

Germination of seeds depends on the physical process of imbibition, the uptake of water due to the low water potential of the dry seed. Imbibing water causes the seed to expand and rupture its coat and also triggers metabolic changes in the embryo that enable it to resume growth (FIGURE 38.13). Following hydration, enzymes begin digesting the storage materials of the endosperm or cotyledons, and the nutrients are transferred to the growing regions of the embryo (FIGURE 38.13).

Fig 38-13. Mobilization of nutrients during the germination of a barley seed. After the seed imbibes water, the embryo releases hormones called gibberellins (GA) as signals to the aleurone, the thin outer layer of the endosperm. The aleurone responds by synthesizing and secreting digestive enzymes that hydrolyze stored foods in the endosperm, producing small, soluble molecules. One example is a-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch. (A similar enzyme in our saliva helps us digest bread and other foods made from the starchy endosperm of ungerminated seeds.) Sugars and other nutrients absorbed from the endosperm by the scutellum are consumed during growth of the embryo into a seedling.

The first organ to emerge from the germinating seed is the radicle, the embryonic root. Next, the shoot tip must break through the soil surface. In garden beans and many other dicots, a hook forms in the hypocotyl, and growth pushes the hook aboveground (FIGURE 38.14a). Stimulated by light, the hypocotyl straightens, raising the cotyledons and epicotyl. Thus, the delicate shoot apex and bulky cotyledons are pulled aboveground, rather than being pushed tip-first through the abrasive soil. The epicotyl now spreads its first foliage leaves (true leaves, so called to distinguish them from cotyledons, or "seed leaves"). The foliage leaves expand, become green, and begin making food by photosynthesis. The cotyledons shrivel and fall away from the seedling, their food reserves having been consumed by the germinating embryo.

Fig 38-14. Seed germination. The radicle, the root of the embryo, emerges from the seed first. Then the shoot breaks the soil surface by one of the following mechanisms. (a) In beans, straightening of a hook in the hypocotyl pulls the cotyledons from the soil. (b) In peas, the hook is above the cotyledons on the epicotyl, and the cotyledons remain underground. (c) In corn and other grasses, the shoot grows straight up through the tube of the coleoptile.

Light seems to be the main cue that tells the seedling it has broken ground. We can trick a bean seedling into behaving as though it is still buried by germinating the seed in darkness. The seedling extends an exaggerated hypocotyl with a hook at its tip, and the foliage leaves fail to green. After it exhausts its food reserves, the spindly seedling stops growing and dies.

Peas, although in the same family as beans, have a different style of germinating (FIGURE 38.14b). A hook forms in the epicotyl rather than the hypocotyl, and the shoot tip is lifted gently out of the soil by elongation of the epicotyl and straightening of the hook. Pea cotyledons, unlike those of beans, remain behind underground.

Corn and other grasses, which are monocots, use yet a different method for breaking ground when they germinate (FIGURE 38.14c). The coleoptile, the sheath enclosing and protecting the embryonic shoot, pushes upward through the soil and into the air. The shoot tip then grows straight up through the tunnel provided by the tubular coleoptile.

Seed germination is a precarious stage in a plant's life. The tough seed gives rise to a fragile seedling that will be exposed to predators, parasites, wind, and other hazards. In the wild, only a small fraction of seedlings endure long enough to become parents themselves. Production of enormous numbers of seeds compensates for the odds against individual survival and gives natural selection ample genetic variations to screen. However, this is a very expensive means of reproduction in terms of the resources consumed in flowering and fruiting. Asexual reproduction, generally simpler and less hazardous for offspring than sexual reproduction, is an alternative means of plant propagation.





 Many plants clone themselves by asexual reproduction

Imagine some of your fingers separating from your body, taking up life on their own, and eventually developing into entire copies of yourself. This would be an example of asexual reproduction: offspring derived from a single parent without genetic recombination (which, of course, does not actually occur in humans). The result would be a clone, a population of asexually produced, genetically identical organisms. Many plant species clone themselves by asexual reproduction, also called vegetative reproduction.

Asexual reproduction is an extension of the capacity of plants for indeterminate growth. Plants, remember, have meristematic tissues of dividing, undifferentiated cells that can sustain or renew growth indefinitely. In addition, parenchyma cells throughout the plant can divide and differentiate into the various types of specialized cells, enabling plants to regenerate lost parts. Detached fragments of some plants can develop into whole offspring; a severed stem, for instance, may develop adventitious roots and become a whole plant. Fragmentation, the separation of a parent plant into parts that re-form whole plants, is one of the most common modes of vegetative reproduction (FIGURE 38.15a). A variation of this process occurs in some species of dicots, in which the root system of a single parent gives rise to many adventitious shoots that become separate shoot systems. The result is a clone formed by asexual reproduction from one parent (FIGURE 38.15b). Such asexual propagation has produced the oldest of all known plant clones, a ring of creosote bushes in the Mojave Desert of California, believed to be at least 12,000 years old.

Fig 38-15. Natural mechanisms of vegetative reproduction. (a) Kalanchoe is known as the maternity plant because of the numerous plantlets it produces along its leaf margins. The asexually produced plantlets fragment from their parent and become independent plants. (b) Some aspen groves, such as those shown here, are actually clones of thousands of trees descended by asexual reproduction from the root system of one parent. Notice that genetic differences among the clones result in different timing for the development of fall color and the loss of leaves.

An entirely different mechanism of asexual reproduction has evolved in dandelions and some other plants, which produce seeds without their flowers being fertilized. This asexual production of seeds is called apomixis. A diploid cell in the ovule gives rise to the embryo, and the ovules mature into seeds, which in the dandelion are dispersed by windblown fruit. Thus, though these plants clone themselves by an asexual process, they also have the advantage of seed dispersal, an adaptation usually associated with sexual reproduction.





 Sexual and asexual reproduction are complementary in the life histories of many plants

Many plants are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and each offers advantages in certain situations. Sex generates variation in a population, an asset in an environment where evolving pathogens and other variables affect survival and reproductive success. An additional benefit of sexual reproduction in plants is the seed, which can disperse to new locations and can also wait to grow until hostile environmental conditions have improved.

An advantage of asexual reproduction is that a plant well suited to a particular environment can clone many copies of itself rapidly. Moreover, the offspring of vegetative reproduction, usually mature fragments of the parent plant, are not as frail as the seedlings produced by sexual reproduction. A sprawling clone of prairie grass may cover an area so thoroughly that seedlings of the same or other species have little chance of competing. But in the soil is a pool of seeds, waiting in the wings for some cue to germinate. After a fire, drought, or some other disturbance clears patches of the turf, seedlings can finally get a foothold when conditions improve. The seedlings are unequal in their traits, for their genotypes are products of the sexual recombination of genes. A new competition ensues, in which certain plants excel and clone themselves. Both modes of reproduction, sexual and asexual, have contributed to the success of plants in diverse terrestrial environments.





 Vegetative propagation of plants is common in agriculture

With the objective of improving crops, orchards, and ornamental plants, various methods have been devised for propagating plants asexually. Most are based on the ability of plants to form adventitious roots or shoots.

Clones from Cuttings

Most houseplants, woody ornamentals, and orchard trees are asexually reproduced from plant fragments called cuttings. In some cases, shoot or stem cuttings are used. At the cut end of the shoot a mass of dividing, undifferentiated cells called a callus forms, and then adventitious roots develop from the callus. If the shoot fragment includes a node, then adventitious roots form without a callus stage. Some plants, including African violets, can be propagated from single leaves rather than stems. For still other plants, cuttings are taken from specialized storage stems. For example, a potato can be cut up into several pieces, each with a vegetative bud, or "eye," that regenerates a whole plant.

In a modification of vegetative reproduction from cuttings, a twig or bud from one plant can be grafted onto a plant of a closely related species or a different variety of the same species. Grafting makes it possible to combine the best qualities of different species or varieties into a single plant. The graft is usually done when the plant is young. The plant that provides the root system is called the stock; the twig grafted onto the stock is referred to as the scion. For example, scions from French varieties of vines that produce superior wine grapes are grafted onto root stock of American varieties, which are more resistant to certain soil pathogens. The quality of the fruit, determined by the genes of the scion, is not diminished by the genetic makeup of the stock. In some cases of grafting, however, the stock can alter the characteristics of the shoot system that develops from the scion. For example, dwarf fruit trees are made by grafting normal twigs onto dwarf stock varieties that retard the vegetative growth of the shoot system. Because seeds are produced by the part of the plant derived from the scion, they would give rise to plants of the scion species if planted.

Test-Tube Cloning and Related Techniques

Plant biotechnologists have adopted in vitro methods to create and clone novel plant varieties. It is possible to grow whole plants by culturing small explants (pieces of tissue cut from the parent), or even single parenchyma cells, on an artificial medium containing nutrients and hormones (FIGURE 38.16). The cultured cells divide and form an undifferentiated callus. When the hormonal balance is manipulated in the culture medium, the callus can sprout shoots and roots with fully differentiated cells. The test-tube plantlets can then be transferred to soil, where they continue their growth. A single plant can be cloned into thousands of copies by subdividing calluses as they grow. This method is used for propagating orchids and also for cloning pine trees that deposit wood at unusually fast rates (see FIGURE 30.8f).

Plant tissue culture also facilitates genetic engineering in plants. Most techniques for the introduction of foreign genes into plants require the use of small pieces of plant tissue or single plant cells as the starting material. Test-tube culture makes it possible to regenerate genetically modified (transgenic) plants from a single plant cell into which the foreign DNA has been incorporated. For example, researchers have used recombinant DNA technology to transfer a gene for bean protein into cultured cells from a sunflower plant. The experiment improved the protein quality of sunflower seeds harvested from the transgenic plants. Firing DNA-coated pellets from a gun is one method researchers use to insert foreign DNA into plant cells (FIGURE 38.17). The techniques of genetic engineering are discussed in more detail in Chapter 20.

Some researchers are coupling a technique known as protoplast fusion with tissue culture methods to actually invent new plant varieties that can be cloned. Protoplasts are plant cells that have had their cell walls enzymatically removed by treatment with cell-wall-degrading enzymes (cellulases and pectinases) isolated from fungi (FIGURE 38.18). Before they are cultured, the protoplasts can be screened for mutations that may improve the agricultural value of the plant. It is also possible in some cases to fuse two protoplasts from different plant species that would otherwise be reproductively incompatible, and then culture the hybrid protoplasts. Each of the many protoplasts can regenerate a wall and eventually form a hybrid plantlet. One success of this method has been a hybrid between a potato and a wild relative called black nightshade. The nightshade is resistant to an herbicide that is commonly used to kill weeds. The hybrids are also resistant, and this makes it possible to "weed" a potato field with the herbicide without killing the potato plants.

Researchers can fuse protoplasts from different species to make hybrids and can also culture the hybrid cells to produce a new plant.

The in vitro culturing of plant cells and tissues is fundamental to most types of plant biotechnology. The other basic process behind modern plant biotechnology is the ability to produce transgenic plants through various methods of genetic engineering. In this chapter's last section, we take a closer look at plant biotechnology.





 Neolithic humans created new plant varieties by artificial selection

Humans have intervened in the reproduction and genetic makeup of plants for thousands of years. It is no exaggeration to say that maize is an unnatural monster created by humans. Left on its own in nature, maize would soon become extinct for the simple reason that it cannot spread its seeds. Maize kernels not only are permanently attached to the central axis (the "cob") but also are permanently protected by tough, overlapping leaf sheathes (the "husk"). Obviously, these attributes, so useful to people, arose not by natural selection but by artificial selection by humans (FIGURE 38.19). (See Chapter 22 to review the basic concept of artificial selection.) Indeed, Neolithic (late Stone Age) humans domesticated virtually all of our crop species over a relatively short period about 10,000 years ago. But genetic modification began long before humans started altering crops by artificial selection. For example, the wheat groups we rely on for much of our food supply are the result of natural hybridization between different species of grasses. Such hybridization is common in plants, and has long been exploited by plant breeders to introduce additional genetic variation for artificial selection and crop improvement. Let's consider one modern example, the selective breeding of maize.

Fig 38-19. Maize: a product of artificial selection. Modern maize (bottom) was derived from teosinte (top). Teosinte kernels are tiny, and each one has a husk that must be removed to get at the kernel. The cob shatters during seed dispersal, which probably made harvesting difficult for early farmers. Neolithic farmers selected for larger cob and kernel size as well as the permanent attachment of seeds to the cob and the encasing of the entire cob by a tough husk.

Maize is a major staple in many developing countries. Nevertheless, the most common varieties are relatively poor sources of protein, thus requiring that diets be supplemented with other protein sources such as beans. The proteins that are stored in these popular maize varieties are very low in lysine and tryptophan, two of the eight essential amino acids that humans cannot synthesize and must obtain from their diet (see FIGURE 41.4). Forty years ago, researchers discovered a mutant maize known as opaque-2 that had much higher levels of lysine and tryptophan. But, as is often the case in plant breeding, a highly desirable trait turned out to be closely associated with several undesirable ones. The opaque-2 maize kernels have a soft endosperm that makes them difficult to harvest and more vulnerable to attack by pests. But, of course, this maize variety is more nutritious. Swine fed with opaque-2 maize gain weight three times faster than those fed with normal maize. Using the conventional breeding methods of hybridization and artificial selection, plant breeders were able to convert the original soft opaque-2 endosperm into a more desirable hard endosperm type. This transition took nearly 20 years. Had modern methods of genetic engineering been available then, the genes responsible for the high lysine and tryptophan condition could have been inserted directly into hard-endosperm maize varieties.

Unlike traditional plant breeders, modern plant biotechnologists, using the techniques of genetic engineering, are not limited solely to the transfer of genes between closely related species or varieties of the same species. For example, traditional plant breeding techniques could not be used to insert a desired gene from daffodil into rice, but genetic engineering makes this possible. The term transgenic is used to describe organisms that have been genetically engineered to express a foreign gene from another species. The reason that traditional plant breeders cannot introduce daffodil genes into rice is that the many intermediate species between rice and daffodil and their common ancestor are extinct. In theory, if plant breeders did have the intermediate species at their disposal, they could, probably over the course of several centuries, introduce a daffodil gene into rice by traditional hybridization and breeding methods. With genetic engineering technology, this gene transfer can be accomplished without the need for intermediate species.





 Biotechnology is transforming agriculture

Eight hundred million people on earth suffer from nutritional deficiencies. Forty thousand people die each day of malnutrition, half of them children. Disagreements exist over the causes of such hunger. Some argue that food shortages arise not from a lack of food production but from inequities in distribution: The dire poor simply cannot afford food. Others regard food shortages as evidence that the world is overpopulated--that the human species has exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet (see Chapter 52). Whatever the social and demographic causes of starvation, increasing food production seems like a humane objective. Because land and water are the most limiting resources for food production, the best option will be to increase yields on the available land. Indeed, there is very little "extra" land that can be put to the plow, especially if the few remaining pockets of wilderness are to be conserved. Based on conservative estimates of population growth, the world's farmers will have to produce 40%  more grain per hectare to feed the human population in 2020. Plant biotechnology could help make these crop yields possible.

Already, the commercial adoption by farmers of transgenic crops has been one of the most rapid cases of technology transfer in the history of agriculture. Between 1996 and 1999, the area planted commercially with transgenic crops increased from 1.7 to 39.9 million hectares. These crops include transgenic varieties and hybrids of cotton, maize, and potatoes that contain genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. These "transgenes" encode for a protein (Bt toxin) that effectively controls a number of serious insect pests. The use of such plant varieties greatly reduces the need for spraying crops with chemical insecticides. Considerable progress also has been made in the development of transgenic plants of cotton, maize, soybeans, sugar beet, and wheat that are tolerant to a number of herbicides. The cultivation of these plants could lower production costs and enable farmers to "weed" crops with herbicides (which won't damage the transgenic crop plants) instead of by heavy tillage, which can cause erosion of soil. Researchers are also engineering transgenic plants with enhanced resistance to disease. In one case, a transgenic papaya resistant to a ringspot virus was introduced into Hawaii, thereby saving the papaya industry (FIGURE 38.20). The nutritional quality of plants is also being improved. "Golden Rice," a transgenic variety with a few daffodil genes that increase quantities of vitamin A, was specifically designed to prevent the blindness that develops in many of the world's poor whose diet is chronically deficient in vitamin A (see FIGURE 20.20).

 Plant biotechnology has incited much public debate

Many people, including some scientists, are concerned about the unknown risks associated with the release of GM organisms into the environment. Much of the animosity regarding GM organisms in agriculture is political, economic, or ethical in nature, and outside the scope of this book. But we should consider the biological concerns about GM crops. The most fundamental debate centers on the extent to which GM organisms are an unknown risk that could potentially cause harm to human health or to the environment. Those who want to proceed more slowly with agricultural biotechnology, or stop it entirely, are concerned about the unstoppable nature of the "experiment." If a drug trial produces unanticipated harmful results, the trial is stopped: We cannot stop the "trial" of novel organisms that have been introduced into the biosphere. Chapter 20 introduced the key concerns. Here, we take a closer look at a few of the controversies surrounding plant biotechnology in agriculture.

One of the specific concerns is that genetic engineering could potentially transfer allergens, which are molecules to which some humans are allergic, from a gene source to a plant used for food. So far, there is no credible evidence that any GM plants specifically designed for human consumption have had any adverse effect on human health. Nevertheless, because of these health concerns, activists continue to lobby for the clear labeling of all foods made wholly or in part from products of GM organisms. Some activists also argue for strict regulations against the mixing of GM foods with non-GM foods during food transport, storage, and processing. Some biotechnology advocates, however, point out that similar demands were not raised when "transgenic" crops produced by traditional plant breeding techniques were put on the market. For example, triticale, a completely new crop, was artificially synthesized a few decades ago by combining the genomes of wheat and rye--two distinct genera that do not interbreed in nature. Triticale is now grown on over three million acres worldwide.

Many environmentalists are concerned that the growing of GM crops might have unforeseen effects on nontarget organisms. One recent study indicated that the larvae (caterpillars) of monarch butterflies responded adversely and even died following their consumption in the laboratory of milkweed leaves (their preferred food) heavily dusted with pollen from transgenic maize that produces the Bt toxin. This effect is not too surprising if one considers that Bt toxin was engineered into crop plants specifically because it is toxic to pests closely related to monarchs. Debate about this specific issue now centers on just how big an effect Bt maize pollen has on monarchs in nature, in contrast to the extreme exposure to the Bt toxin in the laboratory experiments. Maize pollen is produced for only a short time during the growing season, and most of it is not wind-dispersed too far from the field. A recent study provided evidence that only those milkweed plants bordering a maize field would potentially be dusted heavily enough with Bt pollen to adversely affect nontarget larvae. Moreover, in considering the negative effects of Bt pollen on monarch butterflies, one must also weigh the effects of the most likely alternative to the cultivation of Bt maize--the spraying of non-Bt maize with chemical pesticides. Such spraying may be even more harmful to the nearby monarch population.

Perhaps the most serious concern that some scientists raise about GM crops is the possibility of the introduced genes escaping from a transgenic crop into related weeds through crop-to-weed hybridization. Perhaps, for example, spontaneous hybridization between a crop engineered for herbicide resistance and a wild relative might give rise to a "superweed" that would be much more difficult to control. Crop-to-weed transgene escape does occur. Its likelihood depends on the ability of the crop and weed to hybridize and on how the transgenes affect the overall fitness of the hybrids. In some cases, a desirable crop trait--a dwarf phenotype, for example--would be disadvantageous to a weed growing in the wild. In other instances, there are no weedy relatives nearby with which to hybridize; soybean, for example, has no wild relatives in the United States. However, many crops, such as cabbage and broccoli, are members of the mustard family and hybridize readily with wild mustard (generally considered to be a weed). In such cases, the planting of nontransgenic plant borders around fields of transgenic crops can help to "brush" the pollen off insect pollinators, thereby reducing crop-to-weed gene transfer. Efforts are also under way to breed male sterility into transgenic crops. These plants will still produce seeds and fruit if they are pollinated by nearby nontransgenic bisexual plants, but they will produce no viable pollen of their own. Another approach is to engineer the transgene into the chloroplast DNA of the crop; chloroplast DNA is inherited strictly from the maternal plant, so transgenes in the chloroplast cannot be transferred by pollen.

The continuing debate about GM organisms in agriculture exemplifies one of this textbook's themes: the relationships of science and technology to society. Technological advances almost always involve some risk that unintended outcomes could occur. In the case of plant biotechnology, zero risk is unrealistic and probably unattainable. Scientists and the public need to assess the possible benefits of transgenic products versus the risks society is willing to take on a case-by-case basis. The best scenario would be for these discussions and decisions to be based on sound scientific information and testing rather than on reflexive fear or blind optimism.
