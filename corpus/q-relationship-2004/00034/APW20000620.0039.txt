SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- North Korea 's economy expanded 6.2 percent in 1999 , the first growth in nine years and a rate that officials said was sustainable .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Officials at Seoul 's central Bank of Korea said this week 's easing of U.S. economic sanctions against Pyongyang and the expected increase in South Korean investment would positively affect the North 's economy .</ENAMEX>
`` It 's reasonable to predict that the worst is over for the North Korean economy , '' said Park Suk -sam , a senior Bank of Korea analyst .
`` We believe that plus economic growth will continue in the North . ''
In its preliminary report , the South Korean bank said that the North 's economy turned around in 1999 for the first time since 1990 , helped by growth in almost all sectors .
Despite the turnaround , the size of North Korea 's economy in 1999 still remained at 75 percent of that 10 years ago in 1989 , it said .
North Korea does not release any economic statistics .
South Korean officials said they calculated the figures with data collected from North Korea 's trading partners and U.N. and other international groups helping the communist country .
Growth in the North 's construction sector was strongest at 24.3 percent , farming at 9.2 percent and mining and manufacturing at 9.9 percent , the report said .
The fall of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe deprived North Korea of its traditional barter trading partners and aid providers .
That caused the North 's economy to shrink 3.7 percent in 1990 and from between 1.1 percent to 6.3 percent through 1998 , the report said .
The report estimated the North 's 1999 gross national product at $ 15.8 billion , less than 4 percent that of South Korea .
The North 's per capita income of $ 714 was about 8 percent that of its southern neighbor .
North Korea 's 1999 trade totaled $ 1.48 billion , compared with $ 263.4 billion in South Korea , it said .
Food and energy shortages were blamed for the North 's economic difficulty , the report said .
Famine hit North Korea in the early 1990s , forcing the reclusive communist country to appeal for outside aid in 1995 to feed its 22 million people .
In 1999 , food production increased with foreign fertilizer aid , bank officials said .
South Korea is currently shipping 200,000 tons of free fertilizer to the North .
Lifting a half-century economic embargo , the United States on Monday allowed trade with North Korea in nonmilitary goods and opened air travel and shipping routes between the two countries .
Washington also eased restrictions on investment by U.S. companies .
U.S. officials said the action was heavy in symbolism and would not spur large trade with North Korea in the immediate future , given that the communist country is just trying to come out of long and extreme isolation .
Seoul officials said North Korea can expect quicker benefit from economic aid and investment from South Korea , following a successful inter- Korea summit last week .
In a deal signed during the first-ever summit , South Korea promised to help rebuild the North 's shattered economy .
