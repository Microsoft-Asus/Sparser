JAWLESS VERTEBRATES

 

 Class Myxini: Hagfishes are the most primitive living "vertebrates"



 

 Class Cephalaspidomorphi: Lampreys provide clues to the evolution of the vertebral column



 

 Some extinct jawless vertebrates had ossified teeth and bony armor



The two extant classes of jawless vertebrates, or agnathans (which means "without jaws"), are the hagfishes and the lampreys. These animals are eel-like in shape, but the true eels are actually bony fishes. In fact, the agnathans represent ancient vertebrate lineages that predate the origin of paired fins, teeth, and bones hardened by mineralization (ossification). Thus, agnathans provide clues about early stages in the evolution of vertebrates.
