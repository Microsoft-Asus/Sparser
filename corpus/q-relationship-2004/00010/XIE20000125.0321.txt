Clinton made the statement at the White House at an event when responding to a published report that implicated the Pakistani government .
The New York Times reported Tuesday that the United States now believes that a terrorist group supported by the Pakistani military was responsible for the hijacking of an Indian airlines jet last month .
`` I guess the simplest thing I can tell you is that we do not have evidence that the Pakistani government was in any way involved in that hijacking , '' Clinton told reporters .
The U.S. Stated Department , however , said the hijackers may have been linked to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir -- a territory disputed by Pakistan and India .
The group , known as Harkat ul- Mujahedeen , was placed on the department 's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat ul- Ansar .
At the State Department , spokesman James Rubin also rejected the speculation that the Pakistani government involved in the hijacking of the plane .
`` We have no reason to believe that the government of Pakistan had foreknowledge , supported or helped carry out '' the hijacking , Rubin said .
Reports also said that the U.S. is considering to put Pakistan into the list of countries that support terrorism .
Meanwhile , Clinton and his senior advisers are weighing a decision whether he should visit Pakistan in March on a planned trip to India and Bangladesh .
