PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The mayor says one of the two police officers shot in a confrontation in north Philadelphia has died.
Mayor Michael Nutter said Tuesday afternoon that the second officer was wounded.
The officer who was killed is the fourth Philadelphia officer to die in the line of duty in the last year.
Authorities earlier Tuesday afternoon said a third person was dead at the scene of the confrontation in a residential area. They have not said what sparked the shooting. News reports have said the dead man was a suspect.
