 Animal diversity exploded during the early Cambrian period

Although the history of animal life dates back to the late Precambrian era, a much greater diversity of animals evolved just after the dawn of the Paleozoic era 543 million years ago. Cnidarians (the phylum that includes jellies) and poriferans (sponges) were already present in the late Precambrian. However, most of the major groups (phyla) of animals make their first fossil appearances during the relatively short span of the Cambrian period's first 20 million years (FIGURE 26.8). In Chapter 32, we'll evaluate a few hypothetical explanations for the so-called Cambrian explosion.
