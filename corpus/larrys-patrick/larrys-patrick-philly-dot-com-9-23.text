Another fallen Phila. officer leaves city reeling

A 30-year-old Philadelphia policeman was shot and killed yesterday by a wanted felon who fired several times into the fallen officer as he lay wounded on a North Philadelphia street.
"He stood over the top of him and killed him," said Homicide Capt. James Clark, who called the killing of Officer Patrick McDonald an "execution."

The officer's slaying came at the end of a foot pursuit and was followed by a shoot-out that left the felon dead, a second policeman seriously wounded, and the city grappling with the death of another police officer killed in the line of duty.

McDonald, an eight-year veteran, was the third Philadelphia officer to die this year and the fifth in the last two years. He was single, a member of the elite Highway Patrol, and lived alone in the Morrell Park neighborhood in the Far Northeast.

The gunman was identified as Daniel Giddings, 27, who was recently released from state prison after serving time for a 1998 robbery and aggravated assault. A warrant had been issued last month for his arrest in connection with an altercation with police.

One of the officers who responded to McDonald's 1:45 p.m. call for assistance, Richard Bowes, 36, was wounded in a leg during the shoot-out, in which police said at least 30 shots were exchanged.

Police said that Giddings was clutching a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol when he fell on the 2300 block of North 17th Street. He died at the scene.

McDonald, who police said had been able to unholster his sidearm but not to fire it, was pronounced dead at Temple University Hospital at 2:08 p.m.

"I do not know what is going on in the minds of some of these individuals out here," an angry Mayor Nutter said outside the hospital. "When they come upon a Philadelphia police officer . . . somehow they believe they can engage in gunfights with us."

Though Philadelphia has recorded a 21 percent decline in homicides this year under Nutter and Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey, the attacks on police officers have increased.

McDonald's killing occurred less than two weeks after the department buried Officer Isabel Nazario, who was killed Sept. 5 when a suspect in a stolen car crashed into her vehicle during a pursuit.

Yesterday, several hundred officers, still wearing black crepe mourning bands on their badges for Nazario, wept openly as news spread outside the hospital of McDonald's death.

His flag-draped body was carried in a gray hearse, escorted by about 20 officers riding thundering motorcycles, from North Philadelphia to the Medical Examiner's Office in University City.

Homicide detectives said that McDonald had been patrolling alone in a vehicle moments before he was killed.

The young officer apparently stopped a car occupied by Giddings and driven by a woman on Bouvier Street near Susquehanna Avenue, about three blocks northwest of Temple University.

As the officer checked the records on the vehicle, Giddings got out of the car and bolted.

While calling on his radio for assistance, McDonald gave chase for about a block, catching up with Giddings on the 2200 block of North Colorado Street, Clark said. The two got into a scuffle, he said, and the gunman stood over the fallen officer and fired multiple shots into his upper body.

Giddings then took a bicycle from a bystander and fled north. Three Highway Patrol officers who arrived on motorcycles confronted the man on Dauphin Street, where he threw the bicycle at them and began shooting, with the officers returning fire, Clark said.

The wounded gunman ran around the corner to 17th Street, where he dropped dead, Clark said.

Bowes, a 12-year veteran who is the married father of three children, was shot in one leg and also taken to Temple Hospital.

"He's going to be fine," Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop Joseph P. McFadden told reporters after visiting the officers' families at the hospital. "Obviously, he's very sad."

Deputy Commissioner Richard J. Ross Jr. said Bowes was fortunate to survive.

"We're just lucky it wasn't two officers," he said.

Police last night were looking for the woman who had been in the car with Giddings. They said she was driving a burgundy 1995 Buick with a registration tag GVM-1665 or GVH-7189.

Police said that Giddings was convicted in 2000 of robbery and assault charges from an attack two years earlier. He was sentenced to six to 12 years and was released earlier this year, police said.

On Aug. 27, Giddings was pulled over in a stolen car and escaped after an altercation with police, Clark said. A warrant for his arrest was issued.

Yesterday's killing took place in the 22d Police District, one of nine districts targeted by Ramsey earlier this year for stepped-up patrols as part of his plan to reduce violent crime.

Some residents expressed frustration about the continuing numbers of shootings and killings in the impoverished neighborhood and the inability of authorities to put an end to it.

"The mayor can't do it," said Audrea Stancil, 60, a funeral director. "The government can't do it. The people here need to do it. This is crazy. This is crazy."

McDonald, a 1996 graduate of Archbishop Ryan High School, was a paramedic before he joined the Police Department in 2000. His father is a retired fire captain.

McDonald's only surviving sibling, a sister, lives in New York. New York City police flew her to Temple Hospital yesterday in a helicopter.

"They're good people," said Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers, who visited the McDonald family at the hospital.

McDonald's slaying added a somber note to the Philadelphia Orchestra's neighborhood concert at City Hall last night.

"One of our own was killed protecting the rest of us," Nutter told the audience of 3,000. "All he wanted to do was to come home to his family after his tour of duty."

Nutter then listed the names of the city police officers killed recently.

"These heroes have been cut down doing their jobs for us," the mayor said. "We must wrap our arms around their families. It is in times such as these that we feel anger, despair and even frustration. However, we must remain resolute. We must stand shoulder to shoulder. These are our heroes."
