SHALI , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Military troops on Sunday raided a home where suspected Chechen rebels were hiding , triggering a shootout in which five people were killed , two of them Russian soldiers , an official said .
The troops used an armored personnel carrier and other vehicles to smash through a fence of the home in the Chechen town of Shali .
A hail of gunfire came from inside the house , killing one soldier and a colonel in Russia 's Federal Security Service , the official said on condition of anonymity .
The Russians returned fire , killing three people , including the target of the raid -- Musa Dzhamalkhanov .
Three women were also wounded , and two unidentified people in the house were detained .
It was unclear why the Russians wanted to arrest Dzhamalkhanov .
The official said he had fought in the previous Chechen conflict in 1994-96 , but not in the ongoing one .
Meanwhile , rebels fired on a government convoy on a major Chechen highway and severely wounded a Russian soldier , the military said Sunday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The convoy of trucks from the Emergency Situations Ministry had been heading west from the Chechen capital , Grozny , to the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia</ENAMEX> .
The highway through the forest has become increasingly dangerous for Russian forces , as rebels continue their hit-and-run attacks , undercutting Russian claims that the organized rebel resistance has been crushed .
Russian artillery bombarded the forest where the rebels escaped after the attack Saturday night in the western Samashki region .
Commandos searching for rebels in the forest Sunday found and defused several mines laid by the retreating militants , the military said .
The military claimed to have destroyed 10 rebel bases since Saturday , and said federal forces in Grozny had arrested three female snipers and the owner of the apartment they used as a base .
The claims could not be independently confirmed ; the military has often exaggerated its success in destroying rebel forces and equipment .
The military conceded on Saturday that as many as 500 rebels were in Grozny , even though the Russians took control of the city more than four months ago .
Russian warplanes continued Sunday to bomb suspected rebel hide-outs in the woods in the Nozhai - Yurt region , near Chechnya 's eastern border with Dagestan .
The planes were shelling suspected bases in the southern Argun and Vedeno gorges , which serve as vital rebel supply routes to Georgia in the south -- the only foreign country bordering Chechnya .
The Russians were driven out of Chechnya in the 1994-96 war .
They re-entered in September , after Islamic militants based in the breakaway republic crossed over into the region of Dagestan and seized several villages .
