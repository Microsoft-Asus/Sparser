 Most species have small geographic ranges

Most species in all taxonomic groups have small geographic ranges; only a small minority of species are widespread. FIGURE 50.27 illustrates this for North American birds and British vascular plants. Ecologists do not know the reason for this pattern, even though it occurs in plants and animals, in aquatic and terrestrial groups, in invertebrates and vertebrates. This pattern of small ranges is related to the observation that most species are relatively rare in nature, and only common organisms tend to have widespread geographic ranges. But this observation simply begs the question: Why are some organisms rare and others common? To explain these patterns of life in the biosphere is one of the research challenges ecologists face. In Chapters 52 and 53, we'll examine how ecologists are trying to answer such questions about abundance and distribution in the biosphere. And throughout this ecology unit, we'll see the impact that we humans, by far the most abundant and widely distributed of all large animals, are having on the entire biosphere.
