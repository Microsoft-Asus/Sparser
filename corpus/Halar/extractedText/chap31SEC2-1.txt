 Absorptive nutrition enables fungi to live as decomposers and symbionts

Fungi are heterotrophs that acquire their nutrients by absorption. In this mode of nutrition, small organic molecules are absorbed from the surrounding medium. A fungus digests food outside its body by secreting powerful hydrolytic enzymes into the food. These exoenzymes, as they are called, decompose complex molecules to the simpler compounds that the fungus can absorb and use.

The absorptive mode of nutrition is associated with the ecological roles of fungi as decomposers (saprobes), parasites, or mutualistic symbionts. Saprobic fungi absorb nutrients from nonliving organic material, such as fallen logs, animal corpses, or the wastes of live organisms. In the process of this saprobic nutrition, fungi decompose the organic material. Parasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells of living hosts. Some of these fungi, such as certain species infecting the lungs of humans, are pathogenic. Pathogenic fungi cause about 80%  of plant diseases. Mutualistic fungi also absorb nutrients from a host organism, but they reciprocate with functions beneficial to their partners in some way, such as aiding a plant in the uptake of minerals from the soil.
