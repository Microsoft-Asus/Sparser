 Phylum Nemertea: Proboscis worms are named for their prey-capturing apparatus

Members of the phylum Nemertea are called proboscis worms or ribbon worms (FIGURE 33.15). A proboscis worm's body is structurally acoelomate, like that of a flatworm, but it contains a small fluid-filled sac that may be a reduced version of a true coelom. The sac and fluid hydraulically operate an extensible proboscis by which the worm captures prey.

Proboscis worms range in length from less than 1 mm to more than 30 m. Nearly all of the 900 or so members of this phylum are marine, but a few species inhabit fresh water or damp soil. Some are active swimmers, and others burrow in the sand.

Proboscis worms and flatworms have similar excretory, sensory, and nervous systems. But, in addition to the unique proboscis apparatus, two anatomical features not found in flatworms have evolved in the phylum Nemertea: a complete digestive tract (with mouth and anus) and a closed circulatory system--the blood is contained in vessels and is therefore distinct from fluid in the body cavity. Proboscis worms have no heart, but the blood is propelled by muscles squeezing the vessels.
