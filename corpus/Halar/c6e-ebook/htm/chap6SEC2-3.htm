What happens to this energy after it has performed work in a machine or an organism? If energy cannot be destroyed, what prevents organisms from behaving like closed systems and recycling their energy? The second law answers these questions.</p><p class="Header3">The Second Law of Thermodynamics</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">second law of thermodynamics</span> can be stated many ways. Let’s begin with the following statement of the second law: Every energy transfer or transformation makes the universe more disordered. Scientists use a quantity called <span class="Emphasis2">entropy</span> as a measure of disorder, or randomness. The more random a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy. We can therefore restate the second law as follows: <span class="Emphasis1">Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe.</span> Although order can increase locally, there is an unstoppable trend toward randomization of the universe as a whole.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">In many cases, increased entropy is evident in the physical disintegration of a system’s organized structure. For example, you can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building. Much of the increasing entropy of the universe is less apparent, however, because it takes the form of an increasing amount of heat, which is the energy of random molecular motion. As the car in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.3b</span> converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, it is also increasing the disorder of its surroundings in the form of heat and the small molecules that are the breakdown products of gasoline.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">In most energy transformations, ordered forms of energy are at least partly converted to heat. Only about 25%  of the chemical energy stored in the fuel tank of an automobile is transformed into the motion of the car; the remaining 75%  is lost from the engine as heat, which dissipates rapidly through the surroundings. Similarly, the children in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.2</span> convert only a fraction of the energy stored in their food to the kinetic energy of ladder climbing and other play. In performing various kinds of work, living cells unavoidably convert organized forms of energy to heat. (This can make a room crowded with people uncomfortably warm.)</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">In machines and organisms, even energy that performs useful work is eventually converted to heat. The organized energy of an automobile’s forward movement becomes heat when the friction of the brakes and tires stops the car. Conversion to heat is the fate of <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> the chemical energy a child uses to climb a slide: Metabolic breakdown of food generates heat during the climb, and the fraction of energy temporarily stored as gravitational potential energy is converted to heat on the way down, as friction warms the surrounding air.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">Conversion of other forms of energy to heat does not violate the first law of thermodynamics. Energy has been conserved, because heat is a form of energy, though energy in its most random state. By combining the first and second laws of thermodynamics, we can conclude that the <span class="Emphasis1">quantity</span> of energy in the universe is constant, but its <span class="Emphasis1">quality</span> is not. In a sense, heat is the lowest grade of energy, as uncoordinated movement of molecules. A system can put heat to work only when there is a temperature difference that results in the heat flowing from a warmer location to a cooler one. If temperature is uniform, as it is in a living cell, then the only use for heat energy is to warm a body of matter, such as an organism.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">How can we reconcile the second law of thermodynamics--the unstoppable increase in the entropy of the universe--with the orderliness of life (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 6.4</span>), which is one of this book’s themes? The key is to remember another theme: Organisms are open systems that exchange energy and materials with their surroundings. It is true that cells create ordered structures from less organized starting materials. For example, amino acids are ordered into the specific sequences of polypeptide chains. But an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms. For example, an animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases carbon dioxide and water--small, simple molecules that store less chemical energy than the food did. The depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism. On a larger scale, energy flows into an ecosystem in the form of light and leaves in the form of heat. Living systems increase the entropy of their surroundings, as predicted by thermodynamic law.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig6-4','../fig/big/fig6-4.jpg','fig6-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig6-4.jpg" alt="fig6-4" name="myfig6-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 6-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Order as a characteristic of life.</span> Order is evident in the detailed anatomy of this root tissue from a buttercup plant (the micrograph shows a cross section). As open systems, organisms can increase their order at the expense of the order of their surroundings.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">During the early history of life, complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors. For example, we can trace the ancestry of the plant kingdom to much simpler organisms called green algae. However, this increase in organization over time in no way violates the second law. The entropy of a particular system, such as an organism, may actually decrease, so long as the total entropy of the <span class="Emphasis1">universe--</span>the system plus its surroundings--increases. Thus, organisms are islands of low entropy in an increasingly random universe. The evolution of biological order is perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
