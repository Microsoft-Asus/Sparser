WHAT IS A SPECIES?

 

 The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation



 

 Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers isolate the gene pools of biological species



 

 The biological species concept hassome major limitations



 

 Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species



Species is a Latin word meaning "kind" or "appearance." Indeed, we learn to distinguish between the kinds of plants or animals--between dogs and cats, for instance--from differences in their appearance. In addition to comparing morphology (body form), modern taxonomists also consider differences in body functions, biochemistry, behavior, and genetic makeup. However, dividing organisms into different species based on comparative data is only part of an extensive effort to better understand the nature of species and the factors that maintain their distinctiveness in nature.
