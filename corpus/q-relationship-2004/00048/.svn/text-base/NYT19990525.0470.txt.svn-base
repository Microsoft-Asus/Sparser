The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday , May 26 : A devastating pattern of security lapses is laid out in the congressional report on China 's acquisition of America 's most vital nuclear and missile secrets .
Beijing remains far from nuclear parity with the United States .
But a bipartisan House committee , headed by Christopher Cox , R - Calif. , , found that China has systematically exploited poor security at American nuclear weapons labs , lax satellite licensing and weak export control laws to speed work on a new generation of nuclear weapons and missiles .
Though some of the committee 's findings have been outlined in news accounts over recent months , the report adds fresh detail and serves as a powerful indictment of failed security and law enforcement by Democratic and Republican administrations dating back to the 1970s .
The Clinton administration , in particular , has a great deal of explaining to do about its anemic response when it first learned of possible Chinese espionage .
The Cox committee has performed an invaluable public service with its unsparing investigation .
The committee found that China had obtained classified information on seven of America 's most modern thermonuclear weapons .
These include the miniaturized bombs used in multiple-warhead missiles as well as in missiles launched from mobile platforms and from submarines .
With this information , China may be able to produce similar weapons of its own .
The stolen material , including computer codes that are essential to warhead design , most likely came from supposedly secure computers at America 's nuclear weapons laboratories .
The report also found that Beijing had exploited commercial deals with American aerospace companies to learn how to avoid launch failures and design missiles more capable of delivering multiple warheads .
The committee specifically found that two companies , Hughes Electronics and Loral Space and Communications , improperly advised the Chinese on rocket design in the mid-1990s without obtaining State Department licenses for such discussions .
Despite these breakdowns , the Clinton administration shifted authority for licensing satellite sales from the security-minded State Department to the business-oriented Commerce Department , a decision wisely reversed by Congress last year .
Though earlier administrations also failed to secure America 's nuclear secrets , the Clinton administration 's performance seems especially abysmal .
In particular , the failure of the national security adviser , Samuel Berger , to respond more vigorously when first briefed about possible nuclear espionage three years ago requires further inquiry .
At a minimum Berger should have informed President Clinton and Vice President Gore , coordinated investigative efforts and made sure that his request for tightened security at the labs was carried out immediately .
He also played an important role in the mistaken decision to give the Commerce Department lead authority in satellite licensing decisions .
Republican calls for Berger 's resignation feel premature , but his fitness is in question and must be carefully weighed in the days ahead .
Similarly disturbing is the failure two years ago by Janet Reno 's Justice Department to authorize government investigators to pursue a wiretap of the principal suspect , Wen Ho Lee .
Justice 's handling of the Lee investigation was lackadaisical .
This is but the latest in a series of law-enforcement lapses or political blunders that would have led to Ms. Reno 's removal in any recent administration other than this one .
Serious lapses also occurred at the Energy Department , which , at least until Bill Richardson took over as secretary last fall , failed to assert managerial control over the national weapons labs .
Congress must continue investigating these issues of responsibility , taking care , as the Cox committee did , to avoid sensationalism and undue partisanship .
Together with the administration , it should also move quickly to assure better protection of America 's national security secrets .
Better coordination is needed among the various intelligence and law-enforcement agencies in detecting , investigating and prosecuting nuclear espionage .
The Energy Department must clearly demonstrate that it can manage the labs .
Otherwise it may make sense to transfer them to Pentagon control .
Whichever department is in charge , more rigorous security screening is needed for those engaged in the most sensitive weapons work .
Export -control laws , excessively relaxed at the end of the Cold War and further loosened as part of the Clinton administration 's efforts to encourage commerce with China , must be significantly tightened , particularly with regard to satellites and supercomputers .
The Cox report makes clear the seriousness of Chinese efforts to acquire militarily sensitive technology and underscores America 's vulnerability to such efforts .
Stricter export laws and tighter security at nuclear weapons laboratories will help safeguard American secrets .
But at least as important is a more careful approach on the part of the Clinton administration to dealings with China .
Beijing is worth cultivating as a diplomatic and commercial partner .
But its potential threat to American national security should never be ignored or underestimated .
