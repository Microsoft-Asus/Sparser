SEOUL , October 2 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- South Korea has reponded strongly to the United States ' decision on Wednesday to invoke a punitive trade ruling and force South Korea to open wider its auto market .
Trade , Industry and Energy Minister Lim Chang -yuel today threatened to bring the U.S. move , an escalation of the bilateral trade disputes , to the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- for review .
The Office of U.S. Trade Representative -LRB- USTR -RRB- announced its decision to apply the priority foreign countries practice -LRB- PFCP -RRB- designation to South Korea under the so-called Super 301 Section .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The unilateral decision was based on U.S. allegations that South Korea 's restrictions on foreign entry into the country 's auto market have not relaxed as requested by the U.S. government .
In Washington , U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky noted that South Korea 's cumulative tariffs and tax disadvantages against foreign cars have unfavorably influenced car imports .
Although some progress was made in recent U.S. - South Korea auto talks , she said , South Korea is not prepared to formulate the necessary reform to allow much wider access to its auto market .
South Korea has emerged as the world 's third largest auto exporting country , but foreign cars accounted for only 1 percent of its auto market in 1996 despite the 1995 U.S. - South Korea auto agreement , the top U.S. trade negotiator added .</ENAMEX>
In his response , Lim Chang -yuel said if the U.S. invocation of Super 301 hurts South Korea 's exports even before the USTR takes retaliatory measures , Seoul will bring the case to the WTO .
Seoul and Washington are scheduled to resume their auto talks .
But if the two sides fail to strike an agreement within 12-18 months , the USTR will be likely to take retaliatory measures , such as tariffs and quotas , against South Korea .
U.S. officials at a meeting in Washington on September 25-30 strongly demanded a wider opening of South Korea 's auto market , saying Seoul 's plan to ease foreign access is unsatisfactory .
Washington called for a cut in South Korea 's auto import tariff from 8 percent to 2.5 percent , and a change in the country 's auto taxation system from basing on the engine power to the auto price .
But South Korea had rejected its demand .
Barshefsky said South Korea had failed to explain effectively its complex and expensive type certification procedures for cars , restrictions on auto financing and a biased view of foreign cars .
South Korea exports 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in auto products to the U.S. market annually , and the invocation of Super 301 will adversely affect these exports .
