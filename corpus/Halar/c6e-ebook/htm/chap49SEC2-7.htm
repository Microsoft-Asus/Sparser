These photoreceptors communicate with ganglion cells via bipolar cells. The axons of the ganglion cells transmit the visual sensations (action potentials) to the brain. There is not a one-to-one relationship among the rods and cones, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells; each bipolar cell receives information from several rods or cones, and each ganglion cell from several bipolar cells. The horizontal and amacrine cells carry information across the retina to integrate the signals. All the rods or cones that feed information to one ganglion cell form the receptive field for that cell. The larger the receptive field (the more rods or cones that supply a ganglion cell), the less sharp the image, because it is less evident exactly where the light struck the retina. The ganglion cells of the fovea have very small receptive fields, so visual acuity is very sharp in this area. Black arrows indicate the pathway of visual information (action potentials) from the retina to the optic nerve.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Signals from the rods and cones may follow either vertical or lateral pathways. In the so-called vertical pathway, information passes directly from the receptor cells to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. In the lateral pathway, the horizontal and amacrine cells provide lateral integration of visual signals. Horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptor cells and to several bipolar cells; amacrine cells spread the information from one bipolar cell to several ganglion cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant receptors and bipolar cells that are not illuminated, making the light spot appear lighter and the dark surroundings even darker. This integration, called <span class="Emphasis2">lateral inhibition,</span> sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the image. Lateral inhibition is repeated by the interactions of the amacrine cells with the ganglion cells and occurs at all levels of visual processing.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerves that transmit sensations from the eyes to the brain. The optic nerves from the two eyes meet at the <span class="Emphasis2">optic chiasm</span> near the center of the base of the cerebral cortex (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.16</span>). The nerve tracts of the optic chiasm are arranged in such a way that visual sensations from the left visual field of both eyes are transmitted to the right side of the brain, and visual sensations in the right visual field are transmitted to the left side of the brain. Most of the ganglion cell axons lead to the <span class="Emphasis2">lateral geniculate nuclei</span> of the thalamus. Neurons of the lateral geniculate nuclei continue back to the <span class="Emphasis2">primary visual cortex</span> in the occipital lobe of the cerebrum. Additional interneurons carry the information to other, more sophisticated visual processing and integrating centers elsewhere in the cortex.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig49-16','../fig/big/fig49-16.jpg','fig49-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig49-16.jpg" alt="fig49-16" name="myfig49-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 49-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Neural pathways for vision.</span> Because of the arrangement of neurons in the retinas, optic nerves, and optic chiasm, the right side of the brain receives sensory information about objects in the left visual field (blue), while the left side of the brain receives information from the right visual field (red). Each optic nerve contains about a million axons that synapse with interneurons in the lateral geniculate nuclei. The nuclei relay sensations to the visual cortex, believed to be the first of many brain centers that cooperate in constructing our visual perceptions.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Point-by-point information in the visual field is projected along neurons onto the visual cortex according to its position in the retina, but the information the brain receives is highly distorted. How does the brain convert a complex set of action potentials representing two-dimensional images projected onto our retinas into three-dimensional perceptions of our surroundings? Researchers estimate that at least 30%  of the cerebral cortex--hundreds of millions of interneurons in perhaps dozens of integrating centers--take part in formulating what we actually "see." Determining how these centers integrate such components of our vision as color, motion, depth, shape, and detail is the focus of an exciting, fast-moving research effort.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
