Such a gene pool is described by the <span class="Emphasis2">Hardy-Weinberg theorem,</span> named for the two scientists who derived the principle independently in 1908. The theorem states that the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population’s gene pool remain constant over the generations unless acted upon by agents other than Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles. Put another way, the shuffling of alleles due to meiosis and random fertilization has no effect on the overall gene pool of a population.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">To apply the Hardy-Weinberg theorem, let’s return to our imaginary wildflower population of 500 plants (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 23.3a</span>, p. 448).

How will meiosis during sexual reproduction affect the frequencies of the two alleles in the next generation of our wildflower population? We will assume that the union of sperm and ova in the population is completely random; that is, all male-female mating combinations are equally likely. The situation is analogous to mixing all gametes in a sack and then drawing them randomly, two at a time, to determine the genotype for each zygote (fertilized egg). Each gamete has one allele for flower color, and the allele frequencies of the gametes will be the same as the allele frequencies in the parent population. Every time a gamete is drawn from the pool at random, the chance that the gamete will bear an <span class="Emphasis1">R</span> allele is 0.8, and the chance that the gamete will have an <span class="Emphasis1">r</span> allele is 0.2.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-3a','../fig/big/fig23-3a.jpg','fig23-3a');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-3a.jpg" alt="fig23-3a" name="myfig23-3a"></a><br>a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig23-3b','../fig/big/fig23-3b.jpg','fig23-3b');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig23-3b.jpg" alt="fig23-3b" name="myfig23-3b"></a><br>b.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 23-3.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The Hardy-Weinberg theorem.</span> The gene pool of a nonevolving population remains constant over the generations; Mendelian segregation alone will not alter the relative frequencies of alleles or genotypes.

Thus, about 64%  of the plants in the next generation will have the genotype <span class="Emphasis1">RR</span>. The frequency of <span class="Emphasis1">rr</span> individuals will be about 0.04 (0.2 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.04), or 4% .

The Hardy-Weinberg theorem describes how the Mendelian system has no tendency to alter allele frequencies. For instance, the dominant allele (<span class="Emphasis1">R</span>) has no tendency to increase in frequency from one generation to the next relative to the recessive allele (<span class="Emphasis1">r</span>). The system operates somewhat like shuffling a deck of cards: No matter how many times the deck is reshuffled to deal out new hands, the deck itself remains the same. Aces do not grow more numerous than jacks. And the repeated shuffling of a population’s gene pool over the generations cannot, in itself, increase the frequency of one allele relative to another.</p><p class="Header3">The Hardy-Weinberg Equation</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">We can use our imaginary wildflower population to describe the Hardy-Weinberg theorem in more general terms. We will restrict our analysis to the simplest case of only two alleles, one dominant over the other.

Note that <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> + <span class="Emphasis1">q</span> = 1; the combined frequencies of all possible alleles must add to 100%  for that locus in the population. If there are only two alleles and we know the frequency of one, the frequency of the other can be calculated:</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">If <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> + <span class="Emphasis1">q</span> = 1 then <span class="Emphasis1">p</span> = 1 - <span class="Emphasis1">q</span> and <span class="Emphasis1">q</span> = 1 - <span class="Emphasis1">p</span></p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">When gametes combine their alleles to form zygotes, the probability of generating an <span class="Emphasis1">RR</span> genotype is <span class="Emphasis1">p</span><SUP>2</SUP> (an application of the rule of multiplication).

There are two ways in which an <span class="Emphasis1">Rr</span> genotype can arise, depending on which parent contributes the dominant allele. Therefore, the frequency of heterozygous individuals in the population is 2<span class="Emphasis1">pq</span> (2 &#160;X&#160; 0.8 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.32 in our example).

For instance, one out of approximately 10,000 babies in the United States is born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that, left untreated, results in mental retardation and other problems. (Newborn babies are now routinely tested for PKU, and symptoms can be prevented by following a strict diet.) The disease is caused by a recessive allele; thus, the frequency of individuals in the U.S. population born with PKU corresponds to <span class="Emphasis1">q</span><SUP>2</SUP> in the Hardy-Weinberg equation (<span class="Emphasis1">q</span><SUP>2</SUP> = frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype). Given one PKU occurrence per 10,000 births, <span class="Emphasis1">q</span><SUP>2</SUP> = 0.0001. Therefore, assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions, the frequency of the recessive allele for PKU in the population is <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM23-1.gif"> and the frequency of the dominant allele is <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM23-2.gif"> The frequency of carriers, heterozygous people who do not have PKU but may pass the PKU allele on to offspring, is <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM23-3.gif"> Thus, about 2%  of the U.S. population carries the PKU allele.</p><p class="Header3">The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem and Genetic Variation</p><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText">The Hardy-Weinberg theorem is important conceptually and historically because it shows how Mendel’s theory of inheritance plugs a hole in Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Natural selection requires genetic variation; it cannot act in a genetically uniform population. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem explains how Mendelian inheritance preserves genetic variation from one generation to the next. Pre-Mendelian theories of inheritance were mainly "blending" theories, in which the hereditary factors in the offspring were thought to be a blend of the hereditary factors inherited from the two parents. If a red flower mates with a white one, blending theory predicts that the offspring will be a paler red and will now have hereditary factors for this paler red color. Genetic variation has been eliminated, since the two kinds of factors in the parents have been reduced to only one kind in the offspring. Such a hereditary mechanism would soon produce a uniform population. In Mendelian inheritance, however, the hereditary mechanism has no tendency by itself to reduce genetic variation. The set of alleles inherited by each generation from its parents are in turn passed on when that generation breeds. This nonblending mechanism of inheritance preserves the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts.</p><p class="Header3">The Assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg Theorem</p><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText">For a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it must satisfy five main conditions:</p><TABLE CLASS="Box" WIDTH="100%"><TR><TD><OL type="1"><LI><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Very large population size</span>.
