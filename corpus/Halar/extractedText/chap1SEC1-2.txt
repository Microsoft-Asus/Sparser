EVOLUTION, UNITY, AND DIVERSITY

 

 Diversity and unity are the dual faces of life on Earth



 

 Evolution is the core theme of biology



We can think of biology's enormous scope as having two dimensions. The "vertical" dimension is the size scale that reaches all the way from molecules to the biosphere, as you learned in the preceding section. But there is also a "horizontal" dimension stretching across the great diversity of life, now and throughout life's history. Evolution is the key to understanding this biological diversity. Evolutionary change has been a central feature of life since it arose about 4 billion years ago. The evolutionary connections among all organisms explain the unity and diversity of life. This section introduces two related themes that will help you see these evolutionary connections throughout your study of life.
