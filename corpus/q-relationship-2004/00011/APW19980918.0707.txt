Cuba accused the United States of waging a `` campaign '' against its communist government with its arrest of 10 alleged Cuban spies , and said America holds the `` world record '' in spying .
`` In terms of spying , and especially in undermining the political stability of other countries , there is none in this world with a record like that of the United States , especially in the case of Cuba , '' foreign ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said Thursday in Havana .
He would neither confirm nor deny that the 10 people rounded up last weekend in Florida and charged with spying on the United States were indeed spies , but said Cuba is accustomed to that kind of accusation from the United States .
`` For 40 years , they have organized all kinds of undercover and open activities against the security , the stability and the well-being of the Cuban people , '' he said .
`` We 're used to all kind of campaigns from the United States , '' he said at a weekly news conference .
Cuban officials have said they were studying the arrests and would have an official response sometime soon .
The 10 under arrest in Florida are charged with trying to penetrate U.S. military bases , infiltrate anti- Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations .
Prosecutors say it is the biggest Cuban spy ring uncovered in the United States since Castro took power in 1959 .
The Pentagon says none of the alleged spies obtained U.S. secrets .
