DONGHAE , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Navy salvage teams worked through the night Tuesday in an attempt to raise a captured North Korean submarine that sank while being towed into this South Korean naval base .
With the sub 's crew given up for dead -- or possibly back home in the North -- the South 's government appeared ready to write off its incursion and get on with the business of seeking peace with its northern rival .
In sharp contrast to similar events in the past , there were no calls from Seoul for apologies from the North or threats of retribution .
Instead , President Kim Dae -jung urged a calm assessment of the incident .
The Defense Ministry called the sub 's incursion `` a clear armed provocation , '' but there was no echo from the newly installed civilian government .
`` The submarine incident will not shake our sunshine policy , '' a presidential aide said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
`` The government will try even harder to embrace the North to prevent the repetition of similar incidents . ...
We will deal with the North with patience . ''
`` Today , we realized again how difficult it is to deal with North Korean threats and seek economic cooperation at the same time , '' said the mass-circulation Joong Ang daily .
`` How Kim handles the case will be a litmus test of his North Korea policy . ''
Highlighting the government 's dilemma was the return from North Korea on Tuesday of Chung Ju -yung , chairman of South Korea 's giant Hyundai Group , with word that the North had agreed to lift a decades -old ban on South Korean visits .
Chung , the South 's richest man , said North Korea had agreed to allow Hyundai to run tourist excursions to a scenic mountain region on its east coast , not far from where the doomed submarine departed .
North Korea 's official news agency broke a daylong silence Tuesday and reported that one of the country 's submarines was missing on a training mission after experiencing mechanical problems .
It apparently was referring to the small submarine that South Korean navy Capt. Bang Kuk -joon said sank in 33 meters -LRB- yards -RRB- of water a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- off Donghae when it broke loose from a warship 's tow line .
Defense Ministry officials speculated that the crew either died in the sub before or after it sank , or managed to escape before their vessel was seized Monday after becoming entangled in a fishing net .
`` It will take quite a while to bring it back to the surface . ...
Then things will become clearer , '' Bang said .
As night fell , the waters off this naval port , 180 kilometers -LRB- 112 miles -RRB- east of Seoul , were illuminated with searchlights from helicopters and warships .
The submarine , already mostly submerged and listing badly , was being towed to the harbor Tuesday by a South Korean warship when it broke away from one of the two tow ropes and went nose down to the bottom .
South Korean officials said the submarine got caught in a mackerel fishing net about 18 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- east of the town of Sokcho , just south of the North Korean border .
They described the craft as a `` midget submersible '' used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct coastal surveillance , carrying up to six crewmen .
South Korean fishermen who first spotted the craft reported seeing three crewmen struggling to set their craft free .
But navy frogmen pounded on the sub 's hull with a hammer and used sonar scans without detecting any signs of life .
`` I believe the North Koreans have already killed themselves , '' said Li Gwang Su , 32 , the only sailor captured alive from another , larger North Korean sub that ran aground off the east coast in 1996 .
North Korean agents are reportedly instructed to commit suicide to avoid capture .
In the 1996 incursion , 11 of the 26 North Koreans were said to have been shot to death by one of their commanders , who then killed himself .
That incursion triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years .
One North Korean was believed to have escaped .
North Korea was quest dialogue to build confidence , prevent misunderstanding and reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula . ''
The command said the meeting was a `` good first step in establishing a crisis management mechanism to help prevent or deal with any military incidents '' -- a need it said was underscored by the seizure of the North Korean sub .
The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two nations are technically still at war .
Their border on the divided peninsula is the world 's most heavily guarded , with 2 million troops on both sides .
