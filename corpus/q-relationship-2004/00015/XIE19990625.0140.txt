ISLAMABAD , June 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Officials from the United Nations Drug Control Program -LRB- UNDCP -RRB- said Friday that opium production in Afghanistan is likely to rise again this year .
UNDCP representative in Pakistan and Afghanistan Bernard Frahi told a news briefing here that bad weather depressed opium production to 2,100 tons in Afghanistan last year , but weather has been good for the crop this year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Afghanistan is now believed to be the world 's largest producer and trafficker of narcotics with opium grown on 63,000 hectares , producing an average 3,000 tons of opium every year .
Frahi said the Afghan Taliban are cooperating with the UNDCP in fighting the drug problem but collect tax on poppy crop also .</ENAMEX>
`` We can not accept that , '' he said , adding that pressure should be put on the Taliban to stop it .
The Taliban signed an agreement with the UNDCP in 1997 to fight the drug problem .
The Taliban had destroyed 32 opium-processing factories in Nangarhar province and some poppy plants in Kandahar province , he said .
The poppy crop over 30,000 hectares in Helmand province would be targeted next , Frahi added .
Frahi dispelled the impression that Taliban leaders are involved in drug business , saying that the Taliban could not be ignored and `` we will have to involve them to combat drug trafficking . ''
`` We do not have the resources to address the whole problem , '' Frahi said , referring to the complex problem of weaning poor Afghan farmers away from growing the lucrative poppy crop .
He said Afghanistan is the major supply route of drug smuggling to European countries through Central Asian states .
