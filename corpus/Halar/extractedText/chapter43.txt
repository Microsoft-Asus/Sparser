An animal must defend itself against unwelcome intruders, the many potentially dangerous viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens it encounters in the air, in food, and in water. It must also deal with abnormal body cells, which, in some cases, may develop into cancer. Three cooperative lines of defense that counter these threats have evolved (FIGURE 43.1). Two of these are nonspecific--that is, they do not distinguish one infectious agent from another. The first line of nonspecific defense is external, consisting of epithelial tissues that cover and line our bodies (skin and mucous membranes) and the secretions they produce. The second line of nonspecific defense is internal: It is triggered by chemical signals and involves phagocytic cells and antimicrobial proteins that indiscriminately attack invaders that penetrate the body's outer barriers. The appearance of inflammation is a sign that this second line of defense has been deployed.

The third line of defense is the immune system. The immune system comes into play simultaneously with the second line of defense, but it responds in a specific way to particular microorganisms, aberrant body cells, toxins, and other substances marked by foreign molecules. The body's three lines of defense are somewhat analogous to the defenses of a besieged city: first the city walls, then ordinary soldiers, and finally intelligence officers who identify and track down specific dangerous infiltrators. The immune response, which includes the production of specific defensive proteins called antibodies, involves a diverse group of white blood cells called lymphocytes (seeFIGURES 42.14andFIGURES 42.15). The photograph on this page (a colorized SEM) shows specialized lymphocytes (light green) attacking a cancer cell (brown). This chapter examines how an animal's nonspecific and specific defenses work together to protect the body. Our main focus is on the defense mechanisms of vertebrates, which have a highly developed immune system.

An invading microbe must penetrate the external barrier formed by the skin and mucous membranes, which cover the surface and line the openings of an animal's body. If it succeeds in doing so, the pathogen encounters the second line of nonspecific defense, interacting mechanisms that include phagocytosis, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins.

 Lymphocyte development gives rise to an immune system that distinguishes self from nonself



While microorganisms are under assault by phagocytic cells, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins, they inevitably encounter lymphocytes, the key cells of the immune system--the body's third line of defense. Lymphocytes respond to such contacts by generating efficient and selective immune responses that work throughout the body to eliminate the particular invaders. Keep in mind that the cells of the immune system respond similarly to transplanted cells and even cancer cells, which they detect as foreign.

 Invertebrates have a rudimentary immune system



The immune system can mount two types of responses to antigens: a humoral response and a cell-mediated response. Humoral immunity involves B cell activation and results from the production of antibodies that circulate in the blood plasma and lymph, fluids that were long ago called humors. Around the end of the nineteenth century, researchers performed an experiment in which they transferred such fluids from animals that had recovered from an infection to others that had not been exposed to it. For a short time the latter animals were protected from the infection. The investigators had transferred humoral immunity (antibodies) from animal to animal. They also found that immunity to some infections could be passed along only if cells, later identified as T lymphocytes, were transferred. This second type of immunity, which depends on the action of T cells, became known as cell-mediated immunity.

The circulating antibodies of the humoral response defend mainly against free bacteria, toxins, and viruses present in body fluids. In contrast, the T cells of the cell-mediated response are active against viruses and bacteria within infected body cells and against fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Cell-mediated immunity is crucial in the body's response against transplanted tissue and cancer cells, both of which are perceived as "nonself."FIGURE 43.10 provides an overview of the humoral and cell-mediated responses, the two branches of the immune system, which we will explore shortly. In addition to introducing these two branches, the figure shows the connections linking them--cell-signaling interactions among the lymphocytes. Central to this network of cell-signaling is the helper T cell, which responds to antigen presented by a macrophage and stimulates both B cells and other T cells.

As we continue to learn more about the vertebrate immune system, we expand our understanding of the body's battles against infections and cancer, its establishment of long-term immunity, and its reaction to blood transfusions and tissue transplants. We also gain insight into the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of numerous diseases, including disorders of the immune system itself.





 The skin and mucous membranes provide first-line barriers to infection

Intact skin is a barrier that cannot normally be penetrated by bacteria or viruses, although even minute abrasions may allow their passage. Likewise, the mucous membranes that line the digestive, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts bar the entry of potentially harmful microbes (see FIGURE 40.1). Beyond their role as a physical barrier, the skin and mucous membranes counter pathogens with chemical defenses. In humans, for example, secretions from sebaceous and sweat glands give the skin a pH ranging from 3 to 5, which is acidic enough to prevent colonization by many microbes. (Bacteria that make up the skin's normal flora are adapted to its acidic, relatively dry environment.) Microbial colonization is also inhibited by the washing action of saliva, tears, and mucous secretions that continually bathe the surfaces of exposed epithelia. In addition, all these secretions contain antimicrobial proteins. One of these protective proteins is the enzyme lysozyme (see FIGURE 5.17), which digests the cell walls of many bacteria and thus destroys many bacteria entering the upper respiratory tract and the openings around the eyes.

Mucus, the viscous fluid secreted by cells of mucous membranes, also traps microbes and other particles that contact it. In the trachea, ciliated epithelial cells sweep out mucus with its trapped microbes, preventing them from entering the lungs (FIGURE 43.2). Microbes present in food or water, or those in swallowed mucus, must contend with the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The acid destroys many microbes before they can enter the intestinal tract. There are exceptions, however: Hepatitis A virus, for example, is one of many pathogens that survives gastric acidity and gains access to the body via the digestive tract.

Fig 43-2. First-line respiratory defenses. In the lining of the trachea, shown here, specialized cells (orange) produce mucus that traps microbes before the invaders can enter the lungs. The mucous membrane is also equipped with ciliated cells (yellow). Synchronized beating of the cilia expels mucus and the trapped microbes upward into the pharynx (colorized SEM).





 Phagocytic cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins function early in infection

Microbes that penetrate the first line of defense, such as those that enter through a break in the skin, face the second line of defense. The body's internal mechanisms of nonspecific defense depend mainly on phagocytosis, the ingestion of invading organisms by certain types of white cells (see FIGURES 8.19a and 42.15). As you will see, phagocyte function is intimately associated with an effective inflammatory response and also with certain antimicrobial proteins. These nonspecific mechanisms help limit the spread of microbes in advance of specific immune response.

Phagocytic and Natural Killer Cells

The phagocytic cells called neutrophils constitute about 60% -70%  of all white blood cells (leukocytes). Cells damaged by invading microbes release chemical signals that attract neutrophils from the blood. The neutrophils enter the infected tissue, engulfing and destroying microbes there. (This migration toward the source of a chemical attractant is called chemotaxis.) However, neutrophils tend to self-destruct as they destroy foreign invaders, and their average life span is only a few days.

Monocytes, although they constitute only about 5%  of leukocytes, provide an even more effective phagocytic defense. New monocytes circulate in the blood for only a few hours, then migrate into tissues, developing into large macrophages ("big eaters"). Macrophages, the largest phagocytic cells, are especially effective, long-lived phagocytes. These cells extend long pseudopodia that can attach to polysaccharides on a microbe's surface (FIGURE 43.3). A macrophage engulfs a microbe in a vacuole that fuses with a lysosome (like the "food vacuole" in FIGURE 7.14). The lysosome has two ways of killing the trapped microbe. First, it can generate toxic forms of oxygen. Two of these toxic molecules, superoxide anion and nitric oxide, are now thought to be the main antimicrobial agents within phagocytes. Second, lysosomal enzymes, including lysozyme, digest microbial components. Interestingly, some microbes have evolved mechanisms for evading phagocytic destruction. Some bacteria have outer capsules to which a macrophage cannot attach. Others, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are readily engulfed but are resistant to lysosomal destruction and can even reproduce inside a macrophage. These microorganisms are a particular problem for both nonspecific and specific defenses of the body.

Fig 43-3. Phagocytosis by a macrophage. This micrograph shows fibril-like pseudopodia of a macrophage attaching to rod-shaped bacteria, which will be ingested and destroyed (colorized SEM).

Some macrophages migrate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in certain tissues: in lung (alveolar macrophages), liver (Kupffer's cells), kidney (mesangial cells), brain (microglial cells), connective tissues (histiocytes), and especially in lymph nodes and the spleen, key organs of the lymphatic system (FIGURE 43.4). The fixed macrophages in the spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues are particularly well located to contact infectious agents. Microorganisms, microbial fragments, and foreign molecules that enter the blood encounter macrophages as they become trapped in the netlike architecture of the spleen, while those in tissue fluid flow into lymph and are filtered through the lymph nodes.

About 1.5%  of all leukocytes are eosinophils. Their main contribution to defense is against larger parasitic invaders, such as the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni (see FIGURE 33.10). Eosinophils position themselves against the external wall of a parasite and discharge destructive enzymes from cytoplasmic granules. These cells have only limited phagocytic activity.

Nonspecific defense also includes natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells do not attack microorganisms directly; instead, they destroy virus-infected body cells (as well as abnormal body cells that could become cancerous). NK cells are not phagocytic; rather, they mount an attack on the cell's membrane, causing the cell to lyse (burst open).

The Inflammatory Response

Damage to tissue by a physical injury (such as a cut) or by the entry of microorganisms triggers a localized inflammatory response (FIGURE 43.5). In the injured area, precapillary arterioles dilate and postcapillary venules constrict, increasing the local blood supply (see FIGURE 42.7). These events are responsible for the characteristic redness and heat of inflammation (L. inflammo, "to set on fire"). The blood-engorged capillaries leak fluid into neighboring tissues, causing the edema (swelling) also associated with inflammation.

Fig 43-5. A simplified view of the inflammatory response.

The inflammatory response is initiated by chemical signals. Some of these signals arise from the invading organism itself. Others, such as histamine, are released by cells of the body in response to tissue injury. Histamine is produced by circulating leukocytes called basophils and by mast cells found in connective tissue. When injured, these cells release histamine, triggering both dilation and increased permeability of nearby capillaries. Leukocytes and damaged tissue cells also discharge prostaglandins (see discussion of local regulators in Chapter 45) and other substances that further promote blood flow to the site of injury. Enhanced blood flow and vessel permeability aid in delivering clotting elements to the injured area. Blood clotting marks the beginning of the repair process and helps block the spread of microbes to other parts of the body (see FIGURE 42.16).

Increased local blood flow and capillary permeability also enhance the migration of phagocytic cells from the blood into the injured tissues. Probably the most important element of inflammation--indeed, of nonspecific defense--is phagocytosis. Phagocyte migration to the damage site usually begins within an hour after injury. Chemotactic factors released from invading bacteria and injured tissues attract phagocytes. In addition, molecules called chemokines, secreted by blood vessel endothelial cells and monocytes, also attract phagocytes to the area. Chemokines constitute a group of about 50 different proteins that bind to receptors on many types of leukocytes and induce numerous other changes central to inflammation. For example, they induce the production of toxic forms of oxygen in phagocyte lysosomes and the release of histamine from basophils.

Neutrophils are the first phagocytes to arrive at the point of assault, followed by macrophages that have developed from migrating monocytes. Macrophages not only phagocytose pathogens and their products, but also clean up damaged tissue cells and the remains of neutrophils destroyed in the phagocytic process. The pus that accumulates at the site of some infections consists mostly of dead phagocytic cells and the fluid and proteins that leaked from the capillaries during the inflammatory response. Usually, the pus is absorbed by the body within a few days.

A sliver or other minor injury causes localized inflammation, as you have just seen, but the body may also mount a systemic (widespread) nonspecific response to severe tissue damage or infection. Injured cells often put out a call for reinforcements, emitting chemicals that stimulate the release of more neutrophils from the bone marrow. In a severe infection such as meningitis or appendicitis, the number of leukocytes in the blood may increase severalfold within a few hours of the initial inflammatory events. Another systemic response to infection is fever. Toxins produced by pathogens may trigger the fever, but certain leukocytes also release molecules called pyrogens, which set the body's thermostat at a higher temperature. A very high fever may be dangerous, but a moderate fever contributes to defense by inhibiting the growth of some microorganisms. Fever may also facilitate phagocytosis and, by speeding up body reactions, may speed the repair of tissues.

Certain bacterial infections can induce an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response leading to a condition known as septic shock. Characterized by high fever and low blood pressure, septic shock is the most common cause of death in U.S. critical care units. Clearly, while local inflammation is an essential step toward healing, widespread inflammation can be devastating.

Antimicrobial Proteins

A variety of proteins function in nonspecific defense either by attacking microbes directly or by impeding their reproduction. You have already learned about lysozyme, an antimicrobial enzyme present in tears, saliva, and mucous secretions. Other antimicrobial agents include a set of about 20 serum proteins, known collectively as the complement system, that carry out a cascade of steps leading to the lysis of microbes. Some complement components also function along with chemokines in attracting phagocytic cells to sites of infection. Complement proteins are an essential part of both nonspecific and specific defense. We will learn about them in detail later in this chapter.

Another set of proteins that provide nonspecific defense are the interferons, which are secreted by virus-infected cells. While they do not seem to benefit the infected cell, these antiviral proteins diffuse to neighboring cells and induce them to produce other chemicals that inhibit viral reproduction. In this way, interferons limit the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in the body, helping to control viral infections such as colds and influenza. The defense is not virus-specific; interferons produced in response to one virus may confer short-term resistance to unrelated viruses. In addition to its role as an antiviral agent, one type of interferon activates phagocytes, enhancing their ability to ingest and kill microorganisms. Interferons can now be mass-produced by recombinant DNA technology and are being tested clinically for the treatment of viral infections and cancer.

Let's review the body's nonspecific forms of defense: The first line of defense, the skin and mucous membranes, prevents most microbes from entering the body; the second line of defense uses phagocytes, natural killer cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins to defend against microbes that have managed to enter the body. These two lines of defense are nonspecific in that they do not distinguish among pathogens.





 Lymphocytes provide the specificity and diversity of the immune system

The vertebrate body is populated by two main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells). Like macrophages, both types of lymphocytes circulate throughout the blood and lymph and are concentrated in the spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues (see FIGURE 43.4). Because lymphocytes recognize and respond to particular microbes and foreign molecules, they are said to display specificity. A foreign molecule that elicits a specific response by lymphocytes is called an antigen. Antigens include molecules belonging to viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Antigenic molecules are also found on the surfaces of foreign materials such as pollen and transplanted tissue. B cells and T cells specialize in different types of antigens, and they carry out different, but complementary, defensive actions, as we will see later. One way that an antigen elicits an immune response is by activating B cells to secrete proteins called antibodies. The term antigen is a contraction of antibody-generator: Each antigen has a particular molecular shape and stimulates certain B cells to secrete antibodies that interact specifically with it. In fact, B and T cells can distinguish among antigens with molecular shapes that are only slightly different. So, in contrast to the nonspecific defenses, the immune system targets specific invaders.

The means by which B cells and T cells recognize specific antigens are their plasma membrane-bound antigen receptors. Antigen receptors on a B cell are actually transmembrane versions of antibody molecules and are often referred to as membrane antibodies (or membrane immunoglobulins). The antigen receptors on a T cell, called T cell receptors, are structurally related to membrane antibodies, and they recognize antigens just as specifically. But, unlike antibodies, T cell receptors are never produced in a secreted form. A single T or B lymphocyte bears about 100,000 receptors for antigen, all with exactly the same specificity. The particular structure of a lymphocyte's receptors is determined by genetic events that occur in the lymphocyte during its early development (see FIGURE 19.6). As an unspecialized cell differentiates into a B or T lymphocyte, segments of antibody genes or receptor genes are linked together by a type of genetic recombination, generating a single functional gene for each polypeptide of an antibody or receptor protein. This process, which occurs before any contact with foreign antigens, creates an enormous variety of B and T cells in the body, each bearing antigen receptors of particular specificity. With this diversity of lymphocytes, the immune system has the capacity to respond to millions of different antigenic molecules (even ones that do not yet exist)--and thus to millions of different potential pathogens.





 Antigens interact with specific lymphocytes, inducing immune responses and immunological memory

Although it encounters a large repertoire of B cells and T cells in the body, a microorganism interacts only with lymphocytes bearing receptors specific for its various antigenic molecules. The "selection" of a lymphocyte by one of the microbe's antigens activates the lymphocyte, stimulating it to divide and to differentiate. Eventually the lymphocyte forms two clones of cells. One clone consists of a large number of effector cells, short-lived cells that combat the same antigen. The other clone consists of memory cells, long-lived cells bearing receptors specific for the same antigen. This antigen-driven cloning of lymphocytes is called clonal selection (FIGURE 43.6). The concept of clonal selection is so fundamental to understanding immunity that it is worth restating: Each antigen, by binding to specific receptors, selectively activates a tiny fraction of cells from the body's diverse pool of lymphocytes; this relatively small number of selected cells gives rise to clones of thousands of cells, all specific for and dedicated to eliminating that antigen.

Fig 43-6. Clonal selection. The B cells and T cells in lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs collectively recognize an enormous number of antigens, but each individual cell recognizes only one type of antigen. In this diagram, a B cell is "selected" by an antigen to proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and antibody-secreting cells called plasma cells. For simplicity, we show the anti-gen as free molecules rather than as part of a microbe.

The selective proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes that occurs the first time the body is exposed to an antigen is the primary immune response. In the primary response, about 10 to 17 days are required from the initial exposure to antigen for selected lymphocytes to generate the maximum effector cell response. During this period, selected B cells and T cells generate antibody-producing effector B cells, called plasma cells, and effector T cells, respectively. While these effector cells are developing, a stricken individual may become ill. Eventually, symptoms of illness diminish and disappear as antibodies and effector T cells clear the antigen from the body. If that individual is exposed to the same antigen at some later time, the response is faster (only 2 to 7 days), of greater magnitude, and more prolonged. This is the secondary immune response. Measures of antibody concentrations in the blood serum over time show clearly the difference between primary and secondary immune responses (FIGURE 43.7). In addition to being more numerous, antibodies produced in the secondary response tend to have greater affinity for the antigen than those secreted in the primary response. The immune system's capacity to generate secondary immune responses is called immunological memory. As you have seen, an initial exposure to an antigen gives rise not only to effector cells but also to clones of long-lived T and B memory cells (see FIGURE 43.6). The memory cells are poised to proliferate and differentiate rapidly when they later contact the same antigen. The long-term protection developed after exposure to a pathogen was recognized 2,400 years ago by Thucydides of Athens, who described how those sick and dying of plague were cared for by others who had recovered, "for no one was ever attacked a second time."

Fig 43-7. Immunological memory. This experiment demonstrates that the heightened secondary response, which is due to long-lived memory cells, is specific for a particular antigen--here, antigen A.





 Lymphocyte development gives rise to an immune system that distinguishes self from nonself

Lymphocytes, like all blood cells, originate from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow or liver of a developing fetus. Early lymphocytes are all alike, but they later develop into T cells or B cells, depending on where they continue their maturation (FIGURE 43.8). Lymphocytes that migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, a gland in the thoracic cavity above the heart, develop into T cells ("T" for thymus). Lymphocytes that remain in the bone marrow and continue their maturation there become B cells. The "B" actually stands for the bursa of Fabricius, an organ unique to birds where avian B cells mature, and the place where B lymphocytes were first discovered. But since the B cells of all other vertebrates develop in bone marrow, you can equate "B" with "bone" as well as with "bursa."

Fig 43-8. The development of lymphocytes. Like other blood cells, lymphocytes differentiate from pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow (see FIGURE 42.14). Lymphocytes that continue their maturation in bone marrow develop into B cells, while lymphocytes that move to the thymus and complete their maturation there differentiate into T cells. When mature, lymphocytes of both classes migrate to the other lymphatic organs, where they encounter antigens (see FIGURE 43.4).

Immune Tolerance for Self

While B cells and T cells are maturing in the bone marrow and thymus, their antigen receptors are tested for potential self-reactivity. For the most part, lymphocytes bearing receptors specific for molecules already present in the body are either rendered nonfunctional or destroyed by apoptosis (programmed cell death; see FIGURE 21.18), leaving only lymphocytes that react to foreign molecules. This capacity to distinguish self from nonself continues to develop even as the cells migrate to lymphatic organs. Thus, the body normally has no mature lymphocytes that react against self components: The immune system exhibits the critical feature of self-tolerance. Failure of self-tolerance can lead to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. As you will see in the next section, certain body cell surface molecules are essential in the development of T cell self-tolerance as well as in T cell activity.

The Role of Cell Surface Markers in T Cell Function and Development

Lymphocytes do not react to most self antigens, but T cells do have a crucial interaction with one important group of native molecules. These are a collection of cell surface glycoproteins (proteins with attached sugar chains) encoded by a family of genes called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In humans, the MHC glycoproteins are also known as the HLA (for human leukocyte antigens). Two main classes of MHC molecules mark body cells as "self."Class I MHC molecules are found on almost all nucleated cells--that is, on almost every cell of the body. Class II MHC molecules are restricted to a few specialized cell types, including macrophages, B cells, activated T cells, and the cells that make up the interior of the thymus.

For a vertebrate species, there are numerous different possible alleles for each class I and class II MHC gene; the MHC proteins are the most polymorphic known. As a result of the large number of different alleles in the human population, for example, most of us are heterozygous for every one of our MHC genes. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that any two people, except identical twins, will have exactly the same set of MHC molecules. Thus, the major histocompatibility complex provides a biochemical fingerprint virtually unique to each individual. In fact, the discovery of the MHC occurred in the process of studying the phenomena of skin graft rejection and acceptance; the histo in histocompatibility refers to tissues.

The MHC and its role in the body's rejection of tissue grafts initially puzzled scientists: Why would the vertebrate body have evolved markers that prevent members of the same species from sharing tissues? We now know that MHC molecules are varied from person to person because of their central role in the immune response. Through a process known as antigen presentation, an MHC molecule cradles a fragment of an intracellular protein antigen in its hammocklike groove, carries it to the cell surface, and "presents" it to an antigen receptor on a nearby T cell. Thus T cells are alerted to an infectious agent after it has been internalized by a cell (through phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis), or after it has entered and replicated within a cell (through virus infection). There are two main types of T cells, and each responds to one of the two classes of MHC molecule. Cytotoxic T cells (TC) have antigen receptors that bind to protein fragments (peptides) displayed by the body's class I MHC molecules (FIGURE 43.9a). Helper T cells (TH) have receptors that bind to peptides displayed by the body's class II MHC molecules (FIGURE 43.9b).

Fig 43-9. The interaction of T cells with MHC molecules. Molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surfaces of body cells "present" antigen fragments to T cells. (a) Cytotoxic T cells have receptors for antigen-bearing class I MHC molecules. (b) Helper T cells have receptors for antigen-bearing class II MHC molecules.

Whether or not T cells respond to a pathogen, then, depends on the ability of MHC molecules to present a fragment of it. Fortunately, any one MHC molecule can present a variety of peptides that are structurally similar, and, because of the heterozygosity of our MHC genes, we each make two different MHC polypeptides per gene. So chances are good that at least one of our MHC molecules will be able to present at least one fragment of a particular pathogen to our T cells--and generate an immune response against it. In addition, human populations benefit from having hundreds of different MHC alleles in the gene pool, so that individual collections of MHC molecules vary from person to person. This polymorphism is adaptive because it increases the likelihood that at least some individuals of a population will survive an epidemic.

Let's look at the distribution and roles of class I and class II MHC molecules in the body, in terms of how they defend us against infection. Class I MHC molecules, found in almost all cells, are poised to present fragments of proteins made by infecting microbes, usually viruses, to cytotoxic T cells. As we will see in detail later, cytotoxic T cells respond by killing the infected cells. Because all of our cells are vulnerable to infection by one or another virus, the wide distribution of class I MHC molecules is critical to our health. Class II MHC molecules, on the other hand, are made by only a few cell types, chiefly macrophages and B cells. These cells, called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in this context, ingest bacteria (and viruses) and then destroy them. Class II MHC molecules in these cells collect peptide remnants of this degradation and present them to helper T cells. In response, the helper T cells send out chemical signals that incite other cell types to fight the pathogen.

MHC proteins also play a key role in the development of T-cell self-tolerance. During the development of T cells in the thymus, developing T cells interact with other thymic cells, which have high levels of both class I and class II MHC molecules. Only T cells bearing receptors with affinity for self MHC proteins reach maturity. Developing T cells having receptors with affinity for class I MHC become cytotoxic T cells. Those having receptors with affinity for class II MHC become helper T cells.

Now let's review what you've learned so far about the immune system: The immune responses of B and T lymphocytes exhibit four attributes that characterize the immune system as a whole: specificity, diversity, memory, and the capacity to distinguish self from nonself. A critical component of the immune response is the MHC: Proteins encoded by this gene complex display a combination of self (MHC molecule) and nonself (antigen fragment) that is recognized by specific T cells. In the following section you will learn more about how lymphocytes recognize and respond to foreign substances, and how they generate immunity.





 Helper T lymphocytes function in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity:

an overview

Before we look at the function of helper T lymphocytes, we must return to the MHC and its role in antigen presentation. Recall that class II MHC molecules, the ones recognized by helper T cells, are found only on certain cell types, mainly those that engulf foreign antigens. These antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and some B cells, tell the immune system, via helper T cells, that foreign antigen is in the body. For example, a macrophage that has engulfed and broken down a bacterium contains small fragments of bacterial proteins. As a newly made class II MHC molecule moves toward the macrophage surface, it captures one of these bacterial peptides in its antigen-binding groove and carries it to the surface, revealing the foreign peptide to a helper T cell (FIGURE 43.11, p. 910). The interaction between an APC and a helper T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called CD4. Present on most helper T cells, CD4 binds to part of the class II MHC protein. The interaction between CD4 and a class II MHC molecule helps keep the helper T cell and the APC joined while activation of the TH cell occurs.

Fig 43-11. The central role of helper T cells: a closer look. Helper T cells mobilize both humoral and cell-mediated branches of the immune response. The  indicates stimulation.

When a helper T cell is selected by specific contact with the class II MHC-antigen complex on an APC, the TH cell proliferates and differentiates into a clone of activated helper T cells and memory helper T cells. Activated helper T cells secrete several different cytokines, proteins or peptides that stimulate other lymphocytes. For example, the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps B cells that have contacted antigen differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL-2 also helps cytotoxic T cells become active killers.

The helper T cell itself is also subject to regulation by cytokines. As a macrophage phagocytoses and presents antigen, the macrophage is stimulated to secrete a cytokine called interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-1, in combination with the presented antigen, is what activates the helper T cell to produce IL-2 and other cytokines. Also, in an example of positive feedback, IL-2 secreted by the helper T cell stimulates that same cell to proliferate more rapidly and to become an even more active cytokine producer. In these ways, helper T cells modulate both humoral (B cell) and cell-mediated (cytotoxic T cell) immune responses.





 In the cell-mediated response, cytotoxic T cells counter intracellular pathogens:

a closer look

Antigen-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill cancer cells and cells infected by viruses or other intracellular pathogens. Before we look at these events, we must return to class I MHC proteins and their role in presenting antigen to cytotoxic T cells. Recall that all nucleated cells of the body continuously produce class I MHC molecules. As a newly synthesized class I molecule moves toward the cell surface, it captures a small fragment of one of the other proteins synthesized by that cell. If that cell happens to contain a replicating virus, peptide fragments of viral proteins are captured and transported to the cell surface. In this way, class I MHC molecules expose foreign proteins that are synthesized in infected or abnormal cells to cytotoxic T cells. The interaction between the antigen-presenting infected cell and a cytotoxic T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called CD8. Present on most cytotoxic T cells, CD8 binds to a portion of the class I MHC molecule. The CD8-class I MHC interaction helps keep the two cells in contact while activation of the TC cell is occurring (FIGURE 43.12). Thus, the roles of class I MHC molecules and CD8 are similar to those of class II MHC molecules and CD4, except that different cells are involved.

Fig 43-12. The functioning of cytotoxic T cells. (a) A cytotoxic T cell (TC cell) responds to an infected cell (or cancer cell) that displays an antigen fragment recognized by its T-cell receptor. A class I MHC molecule presents the antigen fragment. (b) In this SEM, the TC cell has lysed the cancer cell.

A cytotoxic T cell, when activated by specific contacts with class I MHC-antigen complexes on an infected cell and further stimulated by IL-2 from a helper T cell, differentiates into an active killer. It kills its target cell--the antigen-presenting cell--primarily by releasing perforin, a protein that forms pores in the target cell's membrane. As ions and water flow into the target cell, it swells and eventually lyses (see FIGURE 43.12a). The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce but also exposes it to circulating antibodies, which mark it for disposal. After destroying an infected cell, the TC cell moves on to kill other cells infected with the same pathogen.

In the same way, TC cells defend against malignant tumors. Because tumor cells carry distinctive molecules not found on normal cells, they are identified as foreign by the immune system. Class I MHC molecules on a tumor cell present fragments of tumor antigen to TC cells. Interestingly, certain cancers and viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus) actively reduce the amount of class I MHC protein on affected cells so that they escape detection by TC cells. The body has a backup defense: Natural killer (NK) cells, part of the body's nonspecific defenses, also lyse virus-infected and cancer cells.





 In the humoral response, B cells make antibodies against extracellular pathogens:

a closer look

You have learned that the humoral immune response is initiated when B cells bearing antigen receptors are selected by binding with specific antigens. You also know that B cell activation is aided by IL-2 and other cytokines secreted from helper T cells activated by the same antigen. Stimulated by both antigen and cytokines, the B cell proliferates and differentiates into a clone of antibody-secreting plasma cells and a clone of memory B cells. Antigens that evoke this type of B cell response are known as T-dependent antigens because they can stimulate antibody production only with help from TH cells (FIGURE 43.13). Most protein antigens are T-dependent.

Fig 43-13. Humoral response to a T-dependent antigen. Many antigens can trigger a humoral (antibody-mediated) immune response by B cells only with the participation of helper T cells. Such antigens are called T-dependent antigens, and most protein antigens are of this type.

Other antigens, such as polysaccharides and proteins with many identical polypeptides, function as T-independent antigens. Such antigens include the polysaccharides of many bacterial capsules and the proteins that make up bacterial flagella. Apparently, the repeated subunits of these antigens bind simultaneously to a number of membrane antibodies on the B cell surface. This provides enough stimulus to the B cell to generate antibody-secreting plasma cells without the help of IL-2. The response to T-independent antigens is very important in defending against many bacteria; however, the response is generally weaker than the response to T-dependent antigens, and no memory cells are generated in T-independent responses.

Before we leave our discussion of B cell function, it is important to recall that B cells bear class II MHC molecules: They are antigen-presenting cells. When antigen first binds to membrane antibodies, the B cell takes in a few of the foreign molecules by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see FIGURE 8.19c). In a process very similar to presentation by macrophages, the B cell presents antigen to a helper T cell. However, although a macrophage can engulf and present peptide fragments from a wide variety of antigens, a B cell internalizes and presents peptides of only the antigen to which it specifically binds. Therefore, immunologists think that macrophages are the main APCs in the primary response (when B cells specific for a particular antigen are rare), whereas B cells, specifically memory B cells, are more important as APCs in secondary responses.

In any given humoral response, the processes just discussed stimulate a variety of different B cells, each giving rise to a clone of thousands of plasma cells. Each plasma cell is estimated to secrete about 2,000 antibody molecules per second over the cell's 4- to 5-day life span. Next we look more closely at antibodies and how they bind to and mediate the disposal of antigens.

Antibody Structure and Function

Antigens that elicit a humoral immune response are typically the protein and polysaccharide surface components of microbes, incompatible transplanted tissue, or incompatible transfused blood cells. In addition, for some of us, the proteins of foreign substances such as pollen or bee venom act as antigens that induce an allergic, or hypersensitive, humoral response (to be discussed later).

Neither the membrane version of the antibody--that is, the B cell receptor for antigen--nor the secreted antibody actually binds an entire antigen molecule. Rather, an antibody interacts with a small, accessible portion of the antigen called an epitope or antigenic determinant (FIGURE 43.14). A single antigen such as a bacterial surface protein usually has several effective epitopes, each capable of inducing the production of specific antibody. It is therefore easy to imagine the entire surface of a bacterium coated with many different kinds of antibodies, each specific for a particular epitope. It is estimated that a bacterium can be bound by 4 million antibody molecules!

Fig 43-14. Epitopes (antigenic determinants). Antibodies bind to epitopes on the surface of an antigen. In this example, three different antibody molecules react with different epitopes on the same large antigen molecule.

Antibodies constitute a group of globular serum proteins called immunoglobulins (Igs). A typical antibody molecule has two identical antigen-binding sites specific for the epitope that provoked its production. Each molecule consists of four polypeptide chains, two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, joined by disulfide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule (FIGURE 43.15a). At the two tips of the Y-shaped molecule are the variable regions (V) of the heavy and light chains, so named because the amino acid sequences in these regions vary extensively from antibody to antibody (see FIGURE 19.6). As shown in FIGURE 43.15b, a heavy-chain V region and a light-chain V region together form the unique contours of an antibody's antigen-binding site. The interaction between an antigen-binding site and its epitope resembles an enzyme-substrate interaction: Multiple noncovalent bonds form between chemical groups on the respective molecules, resulting in a highly stable complex.

Fig 43-15. The structure of a typical antibody molecule.

The power of antibody specificity and antigen-antibody binding has been harnessed for use in laboratory research, clinical diagnosis, and the treatment of diseases. Some of these antibody tools are polyclonal: They are the products of many different clones of B cells, each specific for a different epitope. Others are monoclonal: They are prepared from a single clone of B cells grown in culture. Because they are all identical, the monoclonal antibodies produced by such a culture are specific for the same epitope on an antigen. In both basic research and medicine, antibodies are useful for tagging specific molecules. For example, certain types of cancer have been treated with tumor-specific antibodies covalently coupled to toxin molecules. The toxin-linked antibodies carry out a precise search-and-destroy mission, selectively attaching to and killing tumor cells.

While the antigen-binding sites on an antibody are responsible for its ability to identify a specific antigen, the tail of the Y-shaped antibody, formed by the constant regions (C) of the heavy chains (see FIGURE 43.15a), is responsible for the antibody's distribution in the body and for the mechanisms by which it mediates antigen disposal. There are five major types of heavy-chain constant regions, and these determine the five major classes of antibodies: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE. The structures and functions of each of the five immunoglobulin classes are summarized in TABLE 43.1. Note that each light chain also has a constant region. It is not a part of the antibody tail and does not contribute to Ig class functions.

Table 43-1. The Five Classes of Immunoglobulins

IgM (pentamer)



IgMs are the first circulating antibodies to appear in response to an initial exposure to an antigen; their concentration in the blood then declines rapidly. Thus the presence of IgM usually indicates a current infection. IgM consists of five Y-shaped monomers arranged in a pentagonal structure. The numerous antigen-binding sites make it very effective in agglutinating antigens and in reactions involving complement. IgM is too large to cross the placenta and does not confer maternal immunity.IgG (monomer)



IgG is the most abundant of the circulating antibodies. It readily crosses the walls of blood vessels and enters tissue fluids. IgG also crosses the placenta and confers passive immunity on the fetus. IgG protects against bacteria, viruses, and toxins in the blood and lymph, and triggers action of the complement system.IgA (dimer)



IgA is produced by cells in mucous membranes. The main function of IgA is to prevent the attachment of viruses and bacteria to epithelial surfaces. IgA is also found in many body secretions, such as saliva, perspiration, and tears. Its presence in the first milk produced helps protect the infant from gastrointestinal infections.IgD (monomer)



IgD antibodies do not activate the complement system and cannot cross the placenta. They are mostly found on the surfaces of B cells, probably functioning as antigen receptors that help initiate the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells.IgE (monomer)



IgE molecules are slightly larger than IgG and represent only a small fraction of the antibodies in the blood. The tails attach to mast cells and basophils and, when triggered by an antigen, cause the cells to release histamine and other chemicals that cause an allergic reaction.Antibody-Mediated Disposal of Antigen

The binding of antibodies to antigens to form antigen-antibody complexes is the basis of several antigen disposal mechanisms (FIGURE 43.16, p. 914). The simplest of these is neutralization, in which the antibody binds to and blocks the activity of the antigen. For example, antibodies neutralize a virus by attaching to the molecules that the virus must use to infect its host cell. Similarly, antibodies may bind to the surface of a pathogenic bacterium. These microbes, now coated by antibodies, are readily eliminated by phagocytosis. In a process called opsonization, the bound antibodies enhance macrophage attachment to, and thus phagocytosis of, the microbes.

Fig 43-16. Effector mechanisms of humoral immunity. The binding of antibodies to antigens tags foreign cells and molecules for destruction by phagocytes or the complement system of proteins.

Antibody-mediated agglutination (clumping) of bacteria or viruses effectively neutralizes and opsonizes the microbes. Agglutination is possible because each antibody molecule has at least two antigen-binding sites. IgG, for example, can bind to identical epitopes on two bacterial cells or viral particles, linking them together. IgM can link together five or more viruses or bacteria (as shown in FIGURE 43.16). These large complexes are readily phagocytosed by macrophages. A similar mechanism is precipitation, the cross-linking of soluble antigen molecules--molecules dissolved in body fluids--to form immobile precipitates that are disposed of by phagocytes.

One of the most important antibody-mediated disposal mechanisms is complement fixation, the activation of the complement system by antigen-antibody complexes. Recall that complement consists of about 20 different serum proteins that, in the absence of infection, are inactive. In an infection, however, the first in the series of complement proteins is activated, triggering a cascade of activation steps, each component activating the next in the series. Completion of the complement cascade results in the lysis of many types of viruses and pathogenic cells. Lysis by complement can be achieved in two ways. The classical pathway (so called because it was discovered first) is triggered by antibodies bound to antigen and is therefore important in the humoral immune response. The alternative pathway is triggered by substances that are naturally present on many bacteria, yeast, viruses, and protozoan parasites; it does not involve antibodies and thus is an important nonspecific defense.

The classical pathway can begin when IgM or IgG antibodies bind to a pathogen, such as a bacterial cell (FIGURE 43.17). The first complement component links two bound antibodies and is thus activated, initiating the cascade. Ultimately, complement proteins generate a membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms a pore in the bacterial membrane 7-10 nm in diameter. Ions and water rush into the cell, causing it to swell and lyse. The MAC pore is similar to the perforin pore generated by cytotoxic T cells.

Fig 43-17. The classical complement pathway, resulting in lysis of a target cell.

In both the classical and alternative pathways, many activated complement proteins contribute to inflammation. By binding to basophils and mast cells, some trigger the release of histamine, the injury-signaling molecule that triggers dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels. Several active complement proteins also attract phagocytes to the site. In addition, one of the activated complement proteins can cause opsonization: Copies of this protein coat bacterial surfaces and, like antibodies, stimulate phagocytosis. In a final example of teamwork in the body's defense systems, antibodies, complement, and phagocytes function together in a phenomenon called immune adherence. Microbes coated with antibodies and complement proteins adhere to blood vessel walls, making the pathogens easier prey for phagocytic cells circulating in the blood.

You have seen that antibodies contribute in several ways to phagocytosis by macrophages. Keep in mind that phagocytosis enables macrophages to act as APCs, stimulating helper T cells, which, in turn, stimulate the very B cells whose antibodies contribute to phagocytosis. Thus, positive feedback links together the nonspecific and specific immune systems, resulting in a coordinated and effective response to an active infection.





 Invertebrates have a rudimentary immune system

Although this chapter focuses on the immune mechanisms of vertebrates, invertebrate animals also exhibit highly effective mechanisms of host defense, which undoubtedly have contributed to their evolutionary success. The ability to make the distinction betwen self and nonself is seen in animals as ancient as the sponges. If cells from two sponges of the same species are mixed, the cells from each sponge sort themselves and reaggregate, each excluding cells from the other individual. Invertebrates also have the ability to dispose of what is not self, which they accomplish primarily by phagocytosis. In sea stars, for example, amoeboid cells called coelomocytes phagocytose foreign matter. Furthermore, immunologists have begun to find cytokines in invertebrates. For example, like mammalian macrophages, sea star coelomocytes produce interleukin-1 as they engulf foreign material. The IL-1 enhances the animal's defensive response by stimulating coelomocyte proliferation and attracting more coelomocytes to the area.

Invertebrates depend on innate, nonspecific mechanisms of defense rather than acquired, antigen-specific mechanisms like those that vertebrates accomplish with lymphocytes. However, some invertebrates possess lymphocyte-like cells that produce antibody-like molecules. Insects, for example, have a hemolymph protein, called hemolin, that binds to microbes and assists in their disposal. Hemolin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a large group of proteins that are structurally related to antibodies. Hemolin molecules do not exhibit diversity, but they are likely evolutionary precursors of vertebrate antibodies.

By and large, invertebrates do not exhibit the hallmark of acquired immunity--immunological memory. Sea star coelomocytes, for example, respond to a particular microbe with the same speed no matter how many times they have encountered that invader before. However, earthworms do appear to have a kind of immunological memory. When a portion of body wall from one worm is grafted onto another, the recipient's phagocytic cells attack the foreign tissue. The initial graft is rejected in about two weeks; a second graft from the same donor is rejected in just a few days. Comparative studies of animal immune systems continue to provide insight into the development and evolution of host defense mechanisms, as well as clues about evolutionary patterns in general.





 Immunity can be achieved naturally or artificially

Immunity conferred by recovering from an infectious disease such as chicken pox is called active immunity because it depends on the response of the infected person's own immune system. As is the case with all such infections, this immunity is naturally acquired. Active immunity can also be acquired artificially, by immunization, also known as vaccination. Vaccines include inactivated bacterial toxins, killed microbes, parts of microbes, and viable but weakened microbes. These agents can no longer cause disease, but they retain the ability to act as antigens, stimulating an immune response, and more important, immunological memory. A vaccinated person who encounters the actual pathogen will have the same quick secondary response based on memory cells as a person who has had the disease. Routine immunization of infants and children has dramatically reduced the incidence of infectious diseases such as measles and whooping cough, and has led to the eradication of smallpox, a disfiguring and often fatal viral disease. Unfortunately, not all infectious agents are easily managed by vaccination. For example, although researchers are working intensively to develop a vaccine for HIV, they face many problems, such as the antigenic variability of the virus.

Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another, providing passive immunity. This occurs naturally when IgG antibodies of a pregnant woman cross the placenta to her fetus. In addition, IgA antibodies are passed from mother to nursing infant in breast milk, especially in the early secretions called colostrum. Passive immunity persists only as long as these antibodies last (a few weeks to a few months), but it provides protection from infections until the baby's own immune system has matured. Passive immunity can also be transferred artificially by injecting antibodies from an animal that is already immune to a disease into another animal, conferring short-term but immediate protection against that disease. Thus, for example, a person bitten by a rabid animal may be injected with antibodies from other people who have been vaccinated against rabies. This measure is important because rabies may progress rapidly, and the response to an active immunization could take too long to save the life of the victim. Actually, most people infected with rabies virus are given both passive and active immunizations: The injected antibodies fight the virus for a few weeks, and then the person's own immune response, induced by the immunization and the infection itself, takes over.





 The immune system's capacity to distinguish self from nonself limits blood transfusion and tissue transplantation

In addition to distinguishing between the body's own cells and pathogens such as bacteria, the immune system, given the opportunity, wages war against cells from other individuals. For example, skin transplanted from one person to a nonidentical person will look healthy for a day or two, but it will then be destroyed by immune responses. Interestingly, however, a pregnant woman does not reject the fetus as a foreign body. Apparently, the structure of the placenta is the key to this acceptance (see FIGURE 46.17).

In this section you will learn about the potential problems associated with blood transfusions and tissue transplants. Keep in mind that the body's hostile reaction to an incompatible transfusion or transplant is not a disorder of the immune system, but a normal reaction of a healthy immune system exposed to foreign antigens.

Blood Groups and Blood Transfusion

The genetic basis for the ABO blood groups was discussed in Chapter 14. An individual with type A blood has A antigens on the surface of his or her red blood cells. The A molecule is referred to as an antigen because it may be identified as foreign if placed in the body of another person; the A antigen is not antigenic to its "owner." Similarly, B antigens are found on type B red blood cells, A and B antigens are found on type AB red blood cells, and neither antigen is found on type O red blood cells.

An individual with type A blood will not, of course, produce antibodies to A antigens. However, a person with type A blood has antibodies to the B antigen, even if the person has never been exposed to type B blood. You may find it odd that antibodies to foreign blood group antigens exist in the body even in the absence of an incompatible blood transfusion. These antibodies arise in response to bacteria (normal flora) that have epitopes very similar to blood group antigens. Thus an individual with type A blood does not make antibodies to A-like bacterial epitopes--the immune system considers these as self--but that person does make antibodies to B-like bacterial epitopes. Therefore, if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, the preexisting anti-B antibodies will induce an immediate and devastating transfusion reaction. The ABO blood types and corresponding antibodies are summarized in FIGURE 14.10.

Because blood group antigens are polysaccharides, they induce T-independent responses, which elicit no memory cells. As a result, each response is like a primary response, and it generates IgM anti-blood-group antibodies, not IgG. This is fortunate; because IgM does not cross the placenta, no harm comes to a developing fetus with a blood type different from its mother's. However, another red blood cell antigen, the Rh factor, is able to cause trouble because antibodies produced to it are of the IgG class. A potentially dangerous situation can arise when a mother is Rh-negative (lacks the Rh factor) but has a fetus that is Rh-positive, having inherited the factor from the father. If small amounts of fetal blood cross the placenta, as may happen late in pregnancy or during delivery of the baby, the mother mounts a T-dependent humoral response against the Rh factor. The danger occurs in subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies, when the mother's Rh-specific memory B cells are exposed to the Rh factor. These B cells produce IgG antibodies, which can cross the placenta and destroy the red cells of the fetus. To prevent this, the mother is injected with anti-Rh antibodies after delivering her first Rh-positive baby. She is, in effect, passively immunized (artificially) to eliminate the Rh antigen before her own immune system responds and generates immunological memory against the Rh factor, endangering her future Rh-positive babies.

Tissue Grafts and Organ Transplantation

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes the protein fingerprint unique to each individual, is responsible for stimulating the rejection of tissue grafts and organ transplants. Foreign MHC molecules are antigenic, inducing immune responses against the donated tissue or organ. To minimize rejection, attempts are made to match the MHC of the tissue donor and recipient as closely as possible. In the absence of an identical twin, siblings usually provide the closest tissue-type match. In addition to a close match, various medicines are necessary to suppress the immune response to the transplant. However, this strategy leaves the recipient more susceptible to infection and cancer during the course of treatment. More selective drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506, which suppress helper T cell activation without crippling nonspecific defense or T-independent humoral responses, have greatly improved the success of organ transplants.

In one type of life-giving transplant, that of bone marrow, the graft itself, rather than the host, is the source of potential immune rejection. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia and other cancers, as well as various hematological (blood cell) diseases. As in any transplant, the MHC of donor and recipient are matched as closely as possible. Prior to transplant, the recipient is typically treated with irradiation to eliminate his or her own bone marrow cells, including any abnormal cells. This treatment effectively obliterates the recipient's immune system, leaving little chance of graft rejection. However, the great danger in bone marrow transplants is that the donated marrow, containing lymphocytes, will react against the recipient. This graft versus host reaction is limited if the MHC molecules of the donor and recipient are well matched. Bone marrow donor programs around the world continually seek volunteers; because of the great variability of the MHC, a diverse pool of potential donors is essential.





 Abnormal immune function can lead to disease

The highly regulated interplay of lymphocytes with foreign substances, with each other, and with other body cells provides us with extraordinary protection from many diseases. However, if this delicate balance is disrupted by an immune system malfunction, the effects on the individual can range from the minor inconvenience of some allergies to the serious and often fatal consequences of certain autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases.

Allergies

Allergies are hypersensitive (exaggerated) responses to certain environmental antigens, called allergens. One hypothesis to explain the origin of allergies is that they are evolutionary remnants of the immune system's response to parasitic worms. The humoral mechanism that combats worms is similar to the allergic response that causes such disorders as hay fever and allergic asthma.

The most common allergies involve antibodies of the IgE class (see TABLE 43.1). Hay fever, for example, occurs when plasma cells secrete IgE specific for pollen allergens. Some of the IgE antibodies attach by their tails to mast cells present in connective tissues, without binding to the pollen. Later, when pollen grains enter the body, they attach to the antigen-binding sites of mast cell-associated IgE, cross-linking adjacent antibody molecules. This event induces the mast cell to degranulate--that is, to release histamine and other inflammatory agents from vesicles called granules (FIGURE 43.18, p. 918). Recall that histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels. These inflammatory events lead to typical allergy symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, tearing eyes, and smooth muscle contractions that can result in breathing difficulty. Antihistamines diminish allergy symptoms by blocking receptors for histamine.

Fig 43-18. Mast cells, IgE, and the allergic response.

Sometimes, an acute allergic response can result in anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening reaction to injected or ingested allergens. Anaphylactic shock occurs when widespread mast cell degranulation triggers abrupt dilation of peripheral blood vessels, causing a precipitous drop in blood pressure. Death may occur within a few minutes. Allergic responses to bee venom or penicillin can lead to anaphylactic shock in people who are extremely allergic to these substances. Likewise, people very allergic to peanuts, fish, or other foods have died from eating only tiny amounts of these allergens. Some individuals with severe hypersensitivities carry syringes containing the hormone epinephrine, which counteracts this allergic response.

Autoimmune Diseases

Sometimes the immune system loses tolerance for self and turns against certain molecules of the body, causing one of the many autoimmune diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), for example, the immune system generates antibodies (known as autoantibodies) against all sorts of self molecules, even histones and DNA released by the normal breakdown of body cells. Lupus is characterized by skin rashes, fever, arthritis, and kidney dysfunction. Another antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, leads to damage and painful inflammation of the cartilage and bone of joints. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are the targets of autoimmune cell-mediated responses. A final example is multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common chronic neurological disease in developed countries. In MS, T cells reactive against myelin infiltrate the central nervous system and destroy the myelin of neurons (see FIGURE 48.2). People with MS experience a number of serious neurological abnormalities.

The mechanisms that lead to autoimmunity are not fully understood. For a long time, it was thought that people with autoimmune diseases differed from healthy people in having self-reactive lymphocytes that happened to escape elimination during their development. We now know that healthy people also have lymphocytes with the capacity to react against self. However, these cells are prevented from inducing autoimmune reactions by a number of regulatory mechanisms. So, autoimmune disease likely arises from some failure in immune regulation. One intriguing finding is that the inheritance of particular MHC alleles is associated with susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Immunodeficiency Diseases

There are almost as many immunodeficiency diseases as there are components of the immune system. Many inborn deficiencies affect the function of either humoral or cell-mediated immune defenses. In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), both branches of the immune system fail to function. For people with this genetic disease, long-term survival usually requires a bone marrow transplant that will continue to supply functional lymphocytes. For one type of SCID, caused by deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA), medical scientists have been working to develop a gene therapy in which the individual's own cells are removed, provided with a functional ADA gene, and returned to the body. This treatment would eliminate the danger of graft versus host disease. However, the results to date are equivocal because the patients are also being given additional supplies of the enzyme. Gene therapy for several patients suffering from another type of SCID has also had equivocal results.

Immunodeficiency is not always an inborn condition; an individual may develop immune dysfunction later in life. For example, certain cancers suppress the immune system, especially Hodgkin's disease, which damages the lymphatic system. Another well-known and devastating acquired immune deficiency is AIDS, described in the next section.

Healthy immune function appears to depend on both the endocrine system and the nervous systems. Nearly 2,000 years ago the Greek physician Galen recorded that people suffering from depression were more likely than others to develop cancer. In fact, there is growing evidence that physical and emotional stress can harm immunity. Hormones secreted by the adrenal glands during stress affect the numbers of white blood cells and may suppress the immune system in other ways.

The association between emotional stress and immune function also involves the nervous system. Some neurotransmitters secreted when we are relaxed and happy may enhance immunity. In one study, college students were examined just after a vacation and again during final exams. Their immune systems were impaired in various ways during exam week; for example, interferon levels were lower. These and other observations indicate that general health and state of mind affect immunity. Physiological evidence also points to an immune system-nervous system link: Receptors for neurotransmitters have been discovered on the surfaces of lymphocytes, and a network of nerve fibers penetrates deep into the thymus.





 AIDS is an immunodeficiency disease caused by a virus

In 1981, health care workers in the United States noticed an increasing number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer of the skin and blood vessels, and of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii, a protozoan. The increased rates were notable because of the rarity of these diseases among the general population; they were known to occur mainly in severely immunosuppressed individuals. These observations led to the recognition of what came to be known as acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. People with AIDS are highly susceptible to opportunistic diseases, infections and cancers that take advantage of an immune system in collapse. The Pneumocystis protozoan is a ubiquitous organism, yet it does not cause pneumonia in a person with a healthy immune system. In people with AIDS, opportunistic diseases, neurologic damage, and physiological wasting lead to death.

By 1983, a retrovirus, now called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), had been identified as the causative agent of AIDS (FIGURE 43.19; also see FIGURE 18.7 and the interview that opens this unit). With the AIDS mortality rate close to 100% , HIV is the most lethal pathogen ever encountered. Molecular studies of HIV reveal that the virus probably evolved from another HIV-like virus in chimpanzees in central Africa and appeared in humans sometime between 1915 and 1940, causing rare cases of infection and AIDS that went unrecognized.

Fig 43-19. A T cell infected with HIV. The viruses (blue) bud continuously from the surface of the T cell (orange; colorized SEM). The cell will die, but only after it produces many copies of its viral killer.

There are two major strains of the virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more widely distributed and more virulent strain. Both strains infect cells that bear surface CD4 molecules. As you know, CD4 molecules are located on helper T cells and enhance the binding between those cells and class II MHC-bearing antigen-presenting cells. Because CD4 also functions as the major receptor for the virus, helper T cells are highly susceptible to infection. Other cell types that bear fewer CD4 molecules, such as macrophages, some B lymphocytes, and brain cells, are also among the cells infected by HIV.

The entry of the virus requires not only CD4 on the surface of the susceptible cell but also a second protein molecule, a coreceptor. The coreceptors identified so far include fusin (also called CXCR4), found on helper T cells, and CCR5, found on macrophages. Fusin and CCR5 normally function as receptors for chemokines. In fact, these molecules were first recognized as HIV coreceptors after it was discovered that chemokines can suppress HIV-1 infection. Apparently, chemokines bind to these receptors and block HIV-1 entry. Some people who are innately resistant to HIV-1 owe their resistance to defective chemokine receptors. They are not infected because their coreceptors for HIV are faulty.

Once inside a cell, HIV RNA is reverse-transcribed, and the product DNA is integrated into the host cell genome. In this provirus form, the viral genome directs the production of new virus particles (see FIGURE 18.7). Because a retrovirus exists as a provirus for the life of the infected cell, immune responses fail to eradicate it from the body. Even more challenging to both humoral and cell-mediated responses, however, are the frequent mutational changes that occur in each round of virus replication. Indeed, most HIV particles produced in an infected person differ at least slightly from the original infecting virus.

In spite of these challenges, the immune system engages in a prolonged battle against HIV. After an initial peak, the number of viruses in the blood falls while anti-HIV antibody rises (FIGURE 43.20). The decrease in the number of viruses in the blood results from the early immune response to HIV. Detection of the anti-HIV antibodies, which appear in the blood about 1 to 12 months after infection, is the most common method for identifying infected individuals. A person who is HIV-positive is infected, having tested positive for the presence of antibodies to the virus. The HIV antibody test has also been used to screen all blood supplies in the United States since 1985. Because of the chronic presence of virus, a person continues to have anti-HIV antibodies, perhaps until late in AIDS, when both branches of immunity collapse with the loss of helper T cells.

Fig 43-20. The stages of HIV infection.

The early fall in the level of HIV in the blood is misleading, however. While the number of circulating viruses may be low, viruses continue to be produced in cells of the lymph nodes, causing structural and functional damage there. In time, the concentration of HIV in the blood (the viral load) increases. Causes of this increase include the breakdown of lymphatic tissue function, the release of virus from these tissues, and diminishing responses to the infection because of the depletion of helper T cells (see FIGURE 43.20).

Recent studies have revealed that, in HIV infection, helper T cells die because they become infected with the virus. This may sound obvious; cells often die as a result of virus infection. However, other models for T cell depletion have been proposed to explain the apparent loss of helper T cells not infected by HIV. One model, for example, suggests that HIV-mediated interactions induce a T cell to undergo inappropriately timed apoptosis, a process that is normally highly regulated (see FIGURE 21.18). But while such a mechanism may contribute to helper T cell depletion, it is now thought that direct infection is the primary culprit. In fact, the half-life of an actively infected helper T cell (one producing new copies of HIV) is less than 1.5 days.

The time required for an HIV infection to progress to severe helper T cell depletion and AIDS varies greatly, but it currently averages about ten years. During most of this time the individual exhibits only moderate hints of illness, such as swollen lymph nodes (indicating ongoing virus activity) and occasional fever. People with HIV and their physicians follow changes in the level of T cells as an indication of disease progression. However, it has been shown that measures of viral load are a better indicator of disease prognosis and of the effectiveness of anti-HIV treatment.

At this time, HIV infection cannot be cured, and the progression to AIDS cannot be prevented. New drug combinations show promise in slowing this progression, but these therapies are very expensive and not available to all those with HIV infection. Drugs that seem to slow viral replication when used in various combinations include DNA-synthesis inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as AZT and ddI), and protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors prevent a key step in the synthesis of HIV proteins. Used simultaneously, these kinds of drugs decrease viral load and therefore allow the number of helper T cells to rise. Also important to people with AIDS are the numerous medicines used to treat the myriad of opportunistic diseases they develop. These drugs may prolong life, but they do not cure AIDS.

Transmission of HIV requires the transfer of body fluids containing infected cells, such as semen or blood, from person to person. Unprotected sex (that is, without a condom) among male homosexuals and transmission via nonsterile needles (typically among intravenous drug users) account for most of the AIDS cases reported thus far in the United States and Europe. However, transmission of HIV among heterosexuals is rapidly increasing as a result of unprotected sex with infected partners. In Africa and Asia, transmission has been primarily by heterosexual sex, especially where there is a high incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases that result in genital lesions. These sores facilitate the transmission of HIV, as the skin barrier (first line of defense) is breached and HIV-susceptible cells, mainly macrophages and helper T cells, are attracted to the area by the inflammatory response.

HIV is not transmitted by casual contact. So far, only one case of HIV transmission by kissing has been reported, and both the person who transmitted the virus and the recipient had bleeding gums. Although this case is isolated, it is important to remember that the virus can be transmitted whenever blood or body secretions are passed from one person to another. Transmission of HIV from mother to child can happen in two ways: during fetal development (as occurs in about 25%  of HIV-infected mothers) and during nursing. HIV antibody screening has virtually eliminated blood transfusions as a route of transmission in developed countries. This test, however, will never completely guarantee a safe blood supply because a person may be infected by the virus for several weeks or months before anti-HIV antibodies become detectable.

As of 2000 the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS estimates that 30 to 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV or HIV/AIDS. Of these, approximately 70%  reside in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of people with AIDS is expected to grow by nearly 20%  per year. The best approach for slowing the spread of HIV is to educate people about the practices that transmit the virus, such as using nonsterile needles and having sex without a condom. Although condoms do not completely eliminate the risk of transmitting HIV (or other similarly transmitted viruses, such as the hepatitis B virus), they do reduce it. Anyone who has sex--vaginal, oral, or anal--with a partner who had unprotected sex with another person during the past two decades risks exposure to HIV.

The immune response is one of many adaptations that enable animals to adjust to the adversities of the environment. The next chapter describes several other processes that help maintain favorable conditions within animals as they cope with varying external environments.
