Primordial germ cells of the embryonic testes differentiate into spermatogonia, the stem cells that give rise to sperm. As spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes and then to spermatids, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from diploid (2<span class="Emphasis1">n</span> = 46 in humans) to haploid (<span class="Emphasis1">n</span> = 23). The developing cells are gradually pushed from a location near the outer wall of the seminiferous tubule toward the lumen (central opening) and make their way to the epididymis, where they become motile. This process, from spermatogonia to motile sperm, takes 65 to 75 days in the human male. In mature males, about 3 million spermatogonia start the process each day.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The structure of a sperm cell fits its function (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.12</span>). In most species, a head containing the haploid nucleus is tipped with a special body, the <span class="Emphasis2">acrosome,</span> which contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg. Behind the head, the sperm cell contains large numbers of mitochondria (or a single large one, in some species) that provide ATP for movement of the tail, which is a flagellum. Mammalian sperm shape varies from species to species, with the head a slender comma shape, an oval form (as in the human sperm), or nearly spherical.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig46-12','../fig/big/fig46-12.jpg','fig46-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig46-12.jpg" alt="fig46-12" name="myfig46-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 46-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Structure of a human sperm cell.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Oogenesis</span> is the development of ova--mature, unfertilized egg cells. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 46.13</span>, p. 986, shows the process and its location, the ovary.

First, during the meiotic divisions of oogenesis, cytokinesis is unequal, with almost all the cytoplasm monopolized by a single daughter cell, the secondary oocyte. This large cell can go on to form the ovum; the other products of meiosis, smaller cells called polar bodies, degenerate. This contrasts with spermatogenesis, when all four products of meiosis develop into mature sperm (compare <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 46.11</span> and <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 46.13</span>). Second, while the cells from which sperm develop continue to divide by mitosis throughout the male’s life, this is not the case for oogenesis in the female. At birth, an ovary already contains all the primary oocytes it will ever have. Third, oogenesis has long "resting" periods, in contrast to spermatogenesis, which produces mature sperm from precursor cells in an uninterrupted sequence.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
