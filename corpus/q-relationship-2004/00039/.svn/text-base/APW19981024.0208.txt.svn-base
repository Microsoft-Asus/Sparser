A Japanese artist has a solution to a half-century -old dispute between Russia and Japan over the Kuril Islands : Turn them into an artists ' colony .
`` We should start with minor things , gradually doing away with psychological barriers between the Russians and Japanese , '' Tadashi Goino , who is also a businessman , scientist and composer , told the ITAR - Tass news agency on Friday .
He suggested establishing theaters and museums on the islands and opening them up to Japanese visitors .
The Japanese would gradually `` lose their bitterness , and some of them could settle there , and in 20-30 years a referendum could be held , '' he said .
The islands , located off Russia 's Pacific Coast , were captured by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II , but are still claimed by Japan .
The territorial dispute has prevented the two countries from concluding a peace treaty , though their overall relations have improved in recent years .
Goino , who was speaking during a visit to Russia , is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences , ITAR - Tass said .
