TOKYO
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- A former member of the cult behind the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subways was sentenced to death Tuesday for killing an anti-cult lawyer and joining an earlier gas attack , the court said .
Satoru Hashimoto , 33 , and four other cult members had already been found liable in civil lawsuits for the 1989 killings of attorney Tsutsumi Sakamoto , his wife and infant son .
Hashimoto was the second former member of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult to be sentenced to death in the case .
Kazuaki Okazaki , 39 , was handed the sentence last October but has appealed .
The Tokyo District Court also found Hashimoto guilty of involvement in a sarin nerve gas attack in central Japan in 1995 that killed seven people .
Hashimoto helped a group of cultists spread the deadly gas .
Hashimoto was one of six former cultists charged in the Sakamoto killings , including former guru Shoko Asahara .
Asahara is currently on trial for those murders and the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subways , which killed 12 people and sickened thousands of others .
Hashimoto had argued during the trial that he did not deserve the death penalty because he could not defy Asahara 's orders .
`` You acted at the orders of Asahara , but you bear a heavy responsibility for joining in the crime of your own will , '' Judge Toshio Nagai responded , Kyodo News agency reported Tuesday .
Hashimoto and four other top cultists strangled Sakamoto , his wife , and their 1-year -old son on Nov. 4 , 1989 , at their home in Yokohama , just south of Tokyo , at the direction of Asahara , police say .
Sakamoto was preparing a lawsuit against the cult when he was killed , accusing Aum of luring youngsters into the group .
The bodies of the Sakamoto family , buried in remote mountains of central Japan , were not discovered until after the gas attack in Tokyo .
In the civil lawsuit , Hashimoto and three other cultists were ordered in 1997 to pay $ 4.5 million in damages to Sakamoto 's parents .
Asahara was found liable in an earlier court decision .
