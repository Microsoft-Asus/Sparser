SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
South Korea captured a midget submarine believed to belong to North Korea on Monday after it became entangled in a fishing net .
The vessel was seized in the area where a North Korean submarine ran aground in 1996 -- an incident whose aftermath left 37 people dead and sent relations between the North and South plunging to their lowest level in years .
`` We 're pretty much sure that it belongs to North Korea , but we ca n't officially confirm at this stage that it is theirs , '' a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said .
The spokesman , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a navy ship was towing the vessel to shore .
He described it as a `` midget submersible . ''
`` We suspect there 's somebody inside , but we do n't know how many , '' he said .
The navy described the captured boat as a 70-ton Yugo -class submarine , 3 meters -LRB- 10 feet -RRB- wide and 18 meters -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- long .
North Korea is believed to have several such craft , which normally carry four to five crewmen .
Navy experts said North Korea usually uses Yugo -class subs for infiltration of espionage agents and surveillance .
The subs are lightly armed with machine guns .
The incident could set back efforts by the new government of President Kim Dae -jung to promote a `` sunshine policy '' of engaging communist North Korea rather than isolating it .
`` Indications are that it 's not an accidental border crossing , '' said an official of Seoul 's Unification Ministry , which handles relations with North Korea .
He also spoke on condition of anonymity .
Officials said the vessel got caught in a fishing net about 18 kilometers -LRB- 11 miles -RRB- east of Sokcho , a coastal town just south of the North Korean border and about about 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- northeast of Seoul .
The net had been set to drift from the stern of a South Korean fishing boat , which first spotted the entangled craft and radioed maritime police and the military .
Kim In -yong , skipper of the fishing boat , told police his net got caught in the sub 's propeller and that he saw three or four people on the sub 's deck trying to untangle it .
The Defense Ministry sent four warships and a helicopter to the area , and military units in the Sokcho area were put on a heightened state of alert .
Sokcho is about 8 kilometers -LRB- 5 miles -RRB- from where a North Korean submarine ran aground in September 1996 , touching off a 53-day manhunt for its occupants .
The search by 60,000 soldiers , reservists and police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead .
One North Korean was captured and another was believed to have escaped .
That submarine was twice as large as the one captured Monday .
It was a 325-ton Shark -class sub that measured 34 meters -LRB- 112 feet -RRB- from bow to stern .
South Korea will hold a national security meeting Tuesday to review the latest incident .
Officials said the matter also will be raised when United Nations Command officials meet with North Korean military counterparts at the border village of Panmunjom on Tuesday for the first time in seven years .
The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two nations are technically still at war .
Their border on the divided peninsula is the world 's most heavily guarded , with 2 million troops on both sides .
