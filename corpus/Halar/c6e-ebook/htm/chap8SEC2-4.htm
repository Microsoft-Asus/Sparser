It is important, for example, in the sorting of cells into tissues and organs in an animal embryo. It is also the basis for the rejection of foreign cells (including those of transplanted organs) by the immune system, an important line of defense in vertebrate animals (see Chapter 43). The way cells recognize other cells is by keying on surface molecules, often carbohydrates, on the plasma membrane.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Membrane carbohydrates are usually branched oligosaccharides with fewer than 15 sugar units. (<span class="Emphasis1">Oligo</span> is Greek for "few"; an oligosaccharide is a short polysaccharide.) Some of these oligosaccharides are covalently bonded to lipids, forming molecules called glycolipids. (Recall that <span class="Emphasis1">glyco</span> refers to the presence of carbohydrate.) Most, however, are covalently bonded to proteins, which are thereby glycoproteins (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 8.6</span>).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">The oligosaccharides on the external side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell’s surface enable oligosaccharides to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another. For example, the four human blood groups designated A, B, AB, and O reflect variation in the oligosaccharides on the surface of red blood cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
