HARARE , April 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A senior Zimbabwean veterinary official said today the country will continue to import cattle semen and embryos from Britain despite an outbreak of the fatal mad cow disease .
However , Deputy Director in the Department of Veterinary Services , Welboourne Madzima , said <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">measures would be effected to prevent the disease from spreading to Zimbabwe , a major beef consumer .</ENAMEX>
`` We import semen and embryos because we consider these to be safe , '' said Madzima , adding his department had been aware of the outbreak of the mad cow disease in Britain since 1988 .
His comments follow sentiments by some of the country 's 400 commercial farmers that Zimbabwe should immediately ban the importing of any cattle products from the U.K. until the mad cow disease is under control .
`` It should not be a game of retaliation here .
We have been doing and still do all necessary checks to ensure we do n't import mad cows , '' He said .
Zimbabwe is a net exporter of beef to the European Union , but importer of cattle semen and embryos from Britain and other European countries .
