-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russia 's Mission Control prepared Tuesday to switch off the Mir space station 's central computer and other systems to save energy during a planned six months of unmanned flight .
The ground controllers waited for a week after the station 's last permanent crew returned to Earth to let Mir 's interiors dry before switching the temperature control to the minimum on Tuesday .
Early Wednesday , they will switch off the Mir 's computer , its orientation system and other equipment , letting the station rotate freely in orbit , said Valery Lyndin , a Mission Control spokesman .
Mission Control will help adjust the station 's position in orbit if it sees that the station 's energy supply is dropping below the level needed .
The temperature control system will be running on low to protect vital systems from freezing , Lyndin said .
Switching off the computer and other systems will allow energy and the computer 's resources to be conserved for the docking of a final crew in February or March .
The cleanup crew is expected to spend about a month aboard the station , gradually lowering its orbit .
Immediately after the cosmonauts leave , ground controllers will lower the 140-ton station to burn it up in the atmosphere , guiding its remnants into the Pacific Ocean .
The cash-strapped Russian government has said it can no longer pay for the 13-year -old Mir 's operation .

All previous such fund-raising attempts have failed , and Few believe that money will be found</ENAMEX> .
