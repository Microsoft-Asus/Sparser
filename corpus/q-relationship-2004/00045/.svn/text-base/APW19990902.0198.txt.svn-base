MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russia 's envoy to the International Monetary Fund abruptly quit Thursday , but insisted the decision was unconnected to reports that IMF aid to Russia may have been illegally diverted through the Bank of New York .
Mikhail Zadornov said all IMF money had been spent properly , and that he was resigning to run for parliament in December .
The move came amid concerns that the IMF may delay new loans to Russia over the scandal .
The U.S. government -- the IMF 's largest member -- said it wo n't decide whether to approve new loans until a full accounting is made of the IMF money Russia has already received .
News reports have said U.S. investigators believe Russian organized crime and others laundered billions of dollars through the Bank of New York .
Some reports have suggested that IMF money may have been diverted in the transactions .
No one has been charged in the matter , but on Thursday the Bank of New York dismissed a second employee in connection with the scandal .
A source close to the matter said Svetlana Kudryavtsev , an associate in the bank 's Eastern European division , was fired for failing to cooperate with an internal probe .
The bank had already fired Lucy Edwards , a London -based vice president , last Friday for gross misconduct , violation of the bank 's internal policies , falsification of banks records and failure to cooperate with the bank 's investigation .
In Moscow , Zadornov insisted that IMF aid was n't mishandled , he urged Russian officials to `` take an active role '' in the Bank of New York investigations .
The Russian government has said little about the money laundering case .
Prosecutors said they are looking into the reports , but no formal investigation has been launched .
Russian organized crime has close ties with some officials and corruption is endemic in the government .
Some officials have reacted with nationalist indignation to the allegations reported in Western media .
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday the scandal was part of a deliberate policy by `` certain circles who do n't want Russia to reassert its role as a great power . ''
Russian newspapers took the same line on Thursday .
`` McCarthyism lives .
And its cause forges ahead , '' the influential daily Kommersant proclaimed in a front-page headline .
It went on : `` Only recently the term ` Soviet threat ' went out of the West 's political vocabulary ...
To replace the ` Soviet threat , ' came ` Russian mafia . ' ''
The popular daily Izvestia noted that `` the West , for some unknown reason , has started missing the times of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain . ''
Russian media have also linked the affair to presidential campaigning in the United States .
The reaction reflects the recent decline in relations between the United States and Russia .
The two nations clashed over the Kosovo conflict and the tone from Moscow is increasingly nationalistic , a stance welcomed by many Russians nostalgic for the days of Soviet superpower status .
Zadornov , meanwhile , played down his departure , saying it should n't harm Russia 's relations with the IMF .
He predicted the next scheduled loan would come as scheduled later this month .
Russia is the IMF 's biggest borrower , with about $ 20 billion in lending since 1992 .
A long-time member of the Russian Cabinet , Zadornov said he was resigning to run for parliament as a candidate of the liberal Yabloko party , which has a reputation for honesty in Russia 's often corrupt politics .
President Boris Yeltsin , who must approve the resignation and appoint a successor , did not immediately respond .
`` We have succeeded in fully renewing our relations with international financial institutions , '' Zadornov told a news conference .
`` I consider my mission fulfilled . ''
Zadornov helped negotiate the resumption of IMF aid to Moscow this July after it was frozen in the wake of Russia 's financial meltdown last year .
The IMF was expected to release a $ 640 million installment of a $ 4.5 billion loan package this month .
An IMF mission is currently in Moscow to review Russia 's compliance with conditions for the package .
The Russian ruble fell against the U.S. dollar for a third day Thursday amid concerns that the IMF loan would be delayed .
One dollar bought 25.79 rubles on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange , up from 25.4 rubles the day before .
