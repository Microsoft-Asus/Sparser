									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotide sequences of genes can shed light on the evolutionary divergence of related organisms. Would you expect all the proteins or genes of a given set of organisms living on Earth today to show the same degree of divergence? Why or why not?</p>

									<a name="para95"></a><p class="BlockText">1. A particular small polypeptide is nine amino acids long. Using three different enzymes to hydrolyze the polypeptide at various sites, we obtain the following five fragments (N denotes the amino end of the chain): Ala-Leu-Asp-Tyr-Val-Leu; Tyr-Val-Leu; N-Gly-Pro-Leu; Asp-Tyr-Val-Leu; N-Gly-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu. Determine the primary structure of this polypeptide.</p><a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">2. You are studying a cellular enzyme involved in breaking down fatty acids for energy. Looking at the R groups of the amino acids in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.15</span>, what amino acids would you predict to occur in the parts of the enzyme that interact with the fatty acids? Why might this region of the enzyme need to be sequestered in a pocket, rather than on the enzyme’s surface?</p><a name="para97"></a><p class="BlockText">From the Campbell Biology website you can link to the Hemoglobin-Lab of Biology Labs On-Line, where you can explore the biochemistry of the protein hemoglobin.</p>

									<a name="para98"></a><p class="BlockText">Some amateur and professional athletes take anabolic steroids to help them "bulk up" or build strength. The health risks of this practice are extensively documented. Apart from health considerations, how do you feel about the use of chemicals to enhance athletic performance? Is an athlete who takes anabolic steroids cheating, or is his or her use of such chemicals just part of the preparation required to succeed in a competitive sport? Defend your answer.</p>
