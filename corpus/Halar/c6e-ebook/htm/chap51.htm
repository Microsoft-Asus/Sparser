Tens of thousands of years ago, behavioral knowledge was essential to human survival. By learning the habits of the animals around them, early humans increased their chances of securing a meal and decreased their chances of becoming a meal. Thus, our ancestors’ awareness of animal behavior ultimately enhanced their Darwinian fitness. More generally, our own behavior, as well as that of other animals, has its ultimate basis in evolution</span>.</p><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Consider the male magnolia warbler in the photograph on this page. To our ears, his song is a musical "weete, weete, weetchew," with the last note slurring upward. However, as one experienced birder is fond of telling novices, "It’s not music to a bird’s ears. Birds sing for practical reasons--to attract mates, to let other males or females know where they are, to hold a territory where they can raise and feed their young. For birds, singing is about survival and passing genes to the next generation."</span></p><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Bird song provides an excellent introduction to the subject of behavior. For one thing, bird song is amenable to modern experimental methods. As a result, biologists are beginning to understand a great deal about development, functions, and consequences of bird song. Bird song is also attractive to researchers because of several striking parallels between bird song and human speech. It has also become a model system for animal behavior research because it demonstrates a very important generalization: Behavior is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The study of bird song has provided guideposts for the study of other complex behaviors that are less understood</span>.</p><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Studying an animal’s behavior is essential to understanding the animal’s evolution and ecological interactions. This chapter emphasizes the nature of animal behavior, how biologists study it, and the function of behavior in the relationship between an animal and its environment</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
