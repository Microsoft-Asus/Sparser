KIEF , April 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Ukrainian government decided Wednesday to regulate the country 's fuel market by allowing fuel products to be traded in commodity bourses as of May 1 , the media reported .
The decision is meant to establish a pricing mechanism by allowing prices to fluctuate in line with supply and demand in the market , thus sharpening the competitive edge and preventing bottlenecks in the fuel market , the Ukrainian News Agency reported .
Next month , the trading of oil , natural gas and coal will be moved into merchandise exchanges for public pricing , but the sellers must be state-run enterprises or economic entities controlling over 50 percent of their own shares , the agency said .
State -owned and confiscated energy products , and those used to offset taxes will also be openly traded in bourses .
The Ukrainian Economic Ministry will determine the bourses and exchanges through public bidding to undertake the trading of fuel commodities .
Lacking a transparent mechanism to fix market prices in this sector , most trading in Ukraine are conducted by dickering or chalking up .
As a result , the country has lost vast financial revenues and seen complicated debt relationships exist between fuel traders .
