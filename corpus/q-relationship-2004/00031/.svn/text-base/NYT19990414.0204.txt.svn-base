AMMAN , JORDAN --
Queen Noor glided along the receiving line , greeting a delegation of Arab - American women who had come from New York and California to offer condolences on the death of her popular husband .
With the sleeves of her black sweater pushed up and her blonde hair peeking from beneath a white mourning scarf , King Hussein 's widow was poised and elegant as she introduced the new king 's wife , Princess Rania .
She clasped each outstretched hand and kissed each visitor on both cheeks .
`` We are all one family and we will carry on his legacy , '' the queen repeatedly said .
`` He spent his life committed to peace and we will follow in his footsteps . ''
True to the persona she has developed in her 21-year reign , it was the American -born queen who eased the sadness of those who had come in March to comfort her after Hussein 's death from cancer on Feb. 7 at age 63 .
Only later did a glimmer of vulnerability appear beneath the stoic greeting .
Asked how her children were coping , she told the visitors , `` We go from denial to belief and then shock . ''
In the midst of her ordeal , intimates say , an inner strength has guided Queen Noor through this crisis even as she keeps her eye on her own future and that of her first-born son with Hussein , Crown Prince Hamzeh , next in line for the throne .
`` This is the moment when she will reassess her life and see where she will have the most impact and in what way she can best serve the royal family , '' said Rami Khouri , former editor of the Jordan Times .
On the other side of the world in Queen Noor 's U.S. homeland , her future is the subject of close scrutiny .
Keenly interested in what role the 47-year -old queen will carve out for herself , U.S. officials see her as a potential ally , particularly in her eventual role as the next Queen Mother .
Queen Noor 's most visible activity during the past two months has been mentoring the former Princess Rania , who on March 21 was officially proclaimed `` Her Majesty , the Great Queen '' by her husband King Abdullah .
But clearly her priority is her elder son , Crown Prince Hamzeh , whom his father decreed would one day succeed Hamzeh 's older stepbrother , Abdullah .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. officials are cognizant of Queen Noor 's potential ability to be a stabilizing force in Jordan , if only through the lessons and priorities she teaches Hamzeh .
With Jordan 's delicate place in the Middle East geopolitical dance , the State Department has pledged $ 525 million in bilateral aid to Amman along with moral support for Queen Noor , in hopes she does not lose influence in the post- Hussein palace .
Although there is no constitutional role for Queen Noor within Jordan 's monarchial system , Hussein decreed before his death that she would retain her title and live in the royal palace , Bab Al Salam .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">She is expected to retain a public role </ENAMEX>.
With her experience as an international emissary for her husband , she could also be an ambassador for Abdullah , with whom she is said to enjoy a good relationship .
`<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">` She will continue to be important and to play an important role in the Jordanian Government , '' said Hassan Abu Nima , Jordan 's Ambassador to the United States .</ENAMEX>
But her path will be a delicate one in a land where she has never seemed comfortable in the role of the subservient woman .
Even as the new king takes center stage , Queen Noor also dominates , with photos of her appearing daily in the newspapers .
However , observers believe she will take a quiet political role in deference to the new king , whose mother was Hussein 's second wife .
Among her projects , she has assumed Princess Diana 's role as spokeswoman for the Landmine Survivors Network and she will spotlight her philanthropic efforts through the Noor Al Hussein Foundation , a charity she runs .
Her pet project is the Jubilee School , the only high school for gifted youths in the Middle East .
She has also spearheaded efforts to help poor , rural women launch weaving , ceramics and agricultural businesses .
Whether these works and the path she takes now will help overcome her shaky place as a foreign-born queen remains unknown .
Although she has become more popular among Jordanians since her husband 's death , Queen Noor has never fit the stereotype that traditionalists demand .
Slim , blonde and chic , the Princeton -educated queen met Hussein , 16 years her senior , when she was a Middle East urban planning consultant .
Despite Hussein 's lifelong efforts to convince his countrymen to accept her , she was often seen as too ambitious and outspoken .
Her wedding-eve conversion in 1978 from Christianity to Islam and her sketchy command of Arabic did not endear her to the religious establishment , nor did her vocal support for women 's rights or her campaign to get her dying husband to promote her own son to the throne .
For now , the queen manages to blend the modern with the traditional .
After greeting the American delegation , she jumped into the driver 's seat of her sand-colored Mercedes sport utility vehicle and drove herself to the cemetery , where thousands of Jordanians silently waited in line to pay respects to their beloved king .
The king 's death and her adherence to Islamic mourning customs seem to have softened opinions of her .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` She is seen as a powerful , caring , tender woman , '' Khouri said .</ENAMEX>
`<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">` She has emotionally connected with the Jordanian people . ''</ENAMEX>
