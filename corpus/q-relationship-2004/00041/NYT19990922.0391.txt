WASHINGTON --
Federal law-enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had completed a two-year international investigation that led to the arrest of more than 90 drug traffickers and the seizure of 13 tons of cocaine , 2 and-a-half tons of marijuana and more than $ 19 million .
The smuggling operation was centered in Mexico and funneled Colombian cocaine across the Rio Grande to McAllen , Texas , where it was stored in warehouses before being trucked beneath loads of fruits and vegetables to New York City , Chicago , Atlanta and San Diego .
Then it was shipped to distributors in other major cities for street sales , the officials said Wednesday .
The same truck drivers who transported the cocaine north from McAllen brought hundreds of millions in cash south for payment to Mexican drug lords , the officials said .
`` By targeting the cartel 's importation , transportation and distribution network , we have substantially hindered their ability to move cocaine and other drugs into , and around , this country , '' Attorney General Janet Reno said .
Wednesday 's announcement was not accompanied by claims that the investigation broke any records for the amounts of drugs and cash confiscated .
But the officials were clearly elated at the level of cooperation among law-enforcement agencies across the United States and in other countries as well .
Louis J. Freeh , the director of the FBI , called the operation `` an example of what can be achieved through cooperative efforts of all law-enforcement agencies . ''
The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service also took part in the operation .
Donnie Marshall , acting administrator of the drug agency , and Raymond Kelly , the customs commissioner , said the investigation was the kind needed to thwart sophisticated international traffickers .
One target of the operation , Jaime Aguilar Gastelum of Mexico , was arrested Wednesday afternoon by Mexican police in Reynosa , not far across the Rio Grande from McAllen .
He was taken to Mexico City pending extradition to the United States to face felony drug-trafficking charges .
Three other drug tycoons were seized earlier , federal officials said .
They were identified as Arturo Arredondo , who oversaw the loading of trucks ; Jesse Quintanilla , in charge of Chicago distribution , and Jorge Ontiveros - Rodriguez , responsible for wide distribution from San Diego .
Arredondo and Quintanilla hold joint U.S. and Mexican citizenship , while Ontiveros - Rodriguez holds U.S. and Cuban citizenship , the authorities said .
Other suspects were identified as citizens of the United States , the Dominican Republic and Mexico .
Federal officials said police agencies from a dozen states , Mexico and the Dominican Republic participated in the investigation and arrests .
