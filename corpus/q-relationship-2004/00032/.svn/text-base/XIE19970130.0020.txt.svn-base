LONDON , January 29 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The British government said here today that it has flatly rejected Spain 's proposal to share sovereignty over Gibraltar , saying the inhabitants of the territory would not accept it </ENAMEX>.
A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed today that Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes last week `` raised informally with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind the matter of joint sovereignty over Gibraltar , as he has done on a previous occasion . ''
`` The foreign secretary rejected the idea because such a proposal did not have the consent of the people of Gibraltar , '' the spokesman said .
Under the Spanish proposal , Spain would share joint sovereignty of Gibraltar with Britain for up to 100 years and then London should hand back the control of the territory to the Spanish government .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In the mid-15th century , Gibraltar was ruled by Spain and merged into Spanish territory in 1501 .
In 1704 , Austria captured Gibraltar with the joining of Britain and the Netherlands .
The treaty of Utrecht , which was signed in 1713 , formally recognized Gibraltar as British and it became a British colony in 1830 .</ENAMEX>
