In all, the phylum Mollusca has more than 150,000 known species. Most mollusks are marine, though some inhabit fresh water, and there are snails and slugs that live on land. Mollusks are soft-bodied animals (from the Latin <span class="Emphasis1">molluscus</span>, soft), but most are protected by a hard shell made of calcium carbonate. Slugs, squids, and octopuses have reduced shells, most of which are internal, or they have lost their shells completely during their evolution.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Despite their apparent differences, all mollusks have a similar body plan (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.16</span>). The body has three main parts: a muscular <span class="Emphasis2">foot,</span> usually used for movement; a <span class="Emphasis2">visceral mass</span> containing most of the internal organs; and a <span class="Emphasis2">mantle,</span> a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes a shell (if one is present). In many mollusks, the mantle extends beyond the visceral mass, producing a water-filled chamber, the <span class="Emphasis2">mantle cavity,</span> which houses the gills, anus, and excretory pores. Many mollusks feed by using a straplike rasping organ called a <span class="Emphasis2">radula</span> to scrape up food.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-16','../fig/big/fig33-16.jpg','fig33-16');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-16.jpg" alt="fig33-16" name="myfig33-16"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-16.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The basic body plan of mollusks.</span> Three hallmarks of the phylum are the mantle, visceral mass, and foot. A mantle cavity houses gills in many species. The long digestive tract is coiled in the visceral mass. Most mollusks have an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart that pumps circulatory fluid (hemolymph) through arteries into sinuses (body spaces) bathing the organs. Excretory organs called nephridia remove metabolic wastes from the hemolymph. The nervous system consists of a nerve ring around the esophagus, from which nerve cords extend. The enlargement shows the mouth region with the radula, a rasplike feeding organ present in many mollusks. The radula is a belt of backward-curved teeth that extends from the mouth and slides back and forth, scraping and scooping like a backhoe.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Most mollusks have separate sexes, with gonads (ovaries or testes) located in the visceral mass. Many snails, however, are hermaphrodites. The life cycle of many marine mollusks includes a ciliated larva called the <span class="Emphasis2">trochophore,</span> also characteristic of marine annelids (segmented worms) and some other lophotrochozoans (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.9</span>).</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The basic body plan of mollusks has evolved in various ways in the different classes of the phylum. Of the eight classes, we examine four here: Polyplacophora (chitons), Gastropoda (snails and slugs), Bivalvia (clams, oysters, and other bivalves), and Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, and nautiluses) (TABLE 33.3).</p><TABLE BORDER="0"><TR><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1"><B>Table 33-3.</B>&nbsp;<span class="table_title">Major Classes of Phylum Mollusca</span><BR></TH></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="5"><TR><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Class and Examples</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#f1f1f1" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN="">Main Characteristics</TH></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Polyplacophora (chitons)(see FIGURE 33.17)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Marine; shell with eight plates; foot used for locomotion; head reduced</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Gastropoda (snails, slugs) (see FIGURES 33.18 and 33.19)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Marine, freshwater, or terrestrial; asymmetric body, usually with a coiled shell; shell reduced or absent in some; foot for locomotion; radula present</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters) (see FIGURES 33.20 and 33.21)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Marine and freshwater, flattened shell with two valves; head reduced; paired gills; most are filter-feeders; mantle forms siphons</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses) (see FIGURE 33.22)</P></TD><TD valign="top" COLSPAN="" ROWSPAN=""><P class="NormText">Marine; head surrounded by grasping tentacles, usually with suckers; shell external, internal, or absent; mouth with or without radula; locomotion by jet propulsion using siphon made from mantle</P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><p class="Header3">Class Polyplacophora</p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">Chitons are marine animals with oval shapes and shells divided into eight dorsal plates (the body itself, however, is unsegmented).

Try to dislodge a chiton by hand, and you will be surprised at how well its foot, acting as a suction cup, grips the rock. Using this muscular foot, a chiton can creep slowly over the rock surface.

After torsion, some of the organs that were bilateral are reduced in size or are lost on one side of the body. Torsion should not be confused with the formation of a coiled shell, which is an independent developmental process.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText">Most gastropods are protected by single, spiraled shells into which the animals can retreat when threatened (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.19</span>). The shell is often conical, but abalones and limpets have somewhat flattened shells. Many gastropods have distinct heads with eyes at the tips of tentacles. Gastropods inch along literally at a snail’s pace by a rippling motion of the elongated foot. Most gastropods use their radula to graze on algae or plant material. Several groups, however, are predators, and the radula is modified for boring holes in the shells of other mollusks or for tearing apart tough animal tissue. In one group, the cone snails, the teeth of the radula form separate poison darts, which penetrate prey, including fishes.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-19','../fig/big/fig33-19.jpg','fig33-19');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-19.jpg" alt="fig33-19" name="myfig33-19"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-19.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Gastropods.

Bivalves have shells divided into two halves (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.20</span>). The two parts of the shell are hinged at the mid-dorsal line, and powerful adductor muscles draw the two halves tightly together to protect the soft-bodied animal.

Most bivalves are suspension-feeders. They trap fine food particles in mucus that coats the gills, and cilia then convey the particles to the mouth. Water flows into the mantle cavity through an incurrent siphon, passes over the gills, and then exits the mantle cavity through an excurrent siphon.

Sessile mussels secrete strong threads that tether them to rocks, docks, boats, and the shells of other animals. Clams can pull themselves into the sand or mud, using the muscular foot for an anchor. In addition to digging, scallops can also skitter along the seafloor by flapping their shells, rather like the mechanical false teeth sold in novelty shops.</p><p class="Header3">Class Cephalopoda</p><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText">Cephalopods are built for speed, an adaptation that fits their carnivorous diet. Squids and octopuses use beaklike jaws to bite their prey; they then inject poison to immobilize the victim. The mouth is at the center of several long tentacles. A mantle covers the visceral mass, but the shell is reduced and internal (squids) or missing altogether (many octopuses) (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 33.22a</span> and <span class="SmallCap">b</span>).

(<span class="Emphasis1">Cephalopod</span> means "head foot.") Most species of squid are less than 75 cm long, but there are also giant squids, the largest of all invertebrates. The biggest specimen on record was 17 m long (including the tentacles) and weighed about 2 tons.</p><a name="para23"></a><p class="BlockText">Rather than swimming as squids do in the open seas, most octopuses live on the seafloor, where they creep and scurry about in search of crabs and other food.</p><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText">Cephalopods are the only mollusks with a closed circulatory system.
