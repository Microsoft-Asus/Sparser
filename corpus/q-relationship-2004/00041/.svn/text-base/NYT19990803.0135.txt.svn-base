LAREDO , Texas --
A program to train Mexican federal agents to spy on narcotics traffickers along the U.S. - Mexico border and pass the intelligence to the Drug Enforcement Administration has yet to yield any major prosecutions or drug seizures , U.S. officials say .
A ranking official of the General Accounting Office , which studied the 3-year -old program operated by the DEA , blamed mistrust and corruption for the limited success .
The GAO report said that among the Mexican team 's missions was the use of wiretaps and other electronic surveillance to infiltrate the `` command and control '' centers of large-scale drug-traffickers and money-launderers throughout the country .
The GAO , the investigative arm of Congress , released the report last month .
U.S. Officials involved in anti-drug efforts defended the program as a good start in a country that poses the most immediate threat to the United States because of the billions of dollars in drugs that cross the border each year .
`` The point is there is an awful lot of potential , and we are continuing to work to bring it up to potential , '' said Brad Hittle , a senior analyst with the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Hittle said it was vital to work with Mexico since the majority of the cocaine and marijuana , and an increasing amount of heroin , is smuggled across the border .
`` We simply cannot in a realistic way in a democratic society stop the flow of drugs across the border , '' Hittle said from Washington .
`` That is not a good place to set up your first line of defense . ''
The congressional report examined DEA 's efforts to recruit and train law enforcement officers from Bolivia , Colombia , Mexico and Peru -- all of which are significant drug producers or transportation routes -- to help gather intelligence on and investigate drug cartels .
The DEA also hopes to enhance professionalism within the police forces of those nations and to increase trust .
Although Mexico has more specially trained agents than the others , its teams have yielded only minor results , including : -- The arrest of two brothers known as `` Kings of Methamphetamine . ''
But the charges against them have been dropped , and they are fighting extradition to the United States .
-- The seizure of four hotels and other large properties in Cancun allegedly belonging to drug traffickers .
The program , which cost about $ 22 million for fiscal 1997 and 1998 , trains officers at DEA facilities near Washington , D.C. Trainees are hand-picked by the various governments , and they undergo psychological examinations , background investigations and lie-detector tests .
`` It is a procedure that tries to weed out anyone with questionable character in dealing with sensitive information , '' said Terry Parham , spokesman for the DEA headquarters in Washington .
`` It is better than nothing .
It is a step , '' Parham said of the investigative and intelligence teams .
He declined to discuss specifics on how the teams operate .
U.S. agents are still hesitant to share sensitive information with their Mexican counterparts .
They point to 1997 when Brig. Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo , then head of Mexico 's anti-narcotics agency , was arrested after it was discovered he was living in an apartment owned by the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes , once the country 's top drug baron .
And the 45 DEA agents in Mexico are quick to recall the torture and murder of fellow agent Enrique `` Kiki '' Camarena Salazar .
He was snatched off the streets of Guadalajara in 1985 and interrogated at the home of a drug trafficker with multiple ties to the government .
Mexican officials said corruption is a problem on both sides of the border and the program 's growth reflects the confidence of both governments .
`` We depart from the view drug money corrupts everybody , '' said Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia , a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy .
`` It is wrong to portray only Mexicans as falling to the temptation of corruption by drug money . ''
Leonard Lindheim , head of investigations for the Customs Service in South Texas , agreed with Zabalgoitia : `` We know corruption is an issue on both sides of the border ; we have our share at state , local and federal levels .
`` I am sure Mexico is as concerned about us as we are about them , '' said Lindheim , a former DEA agent .
`` There is a question of how much information can be shared . ''
