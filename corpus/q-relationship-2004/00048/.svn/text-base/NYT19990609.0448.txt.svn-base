WASHINGTON --
In an effort to prevent sensitive technology from being used by the Chinese military , the Commerce Department has told exporters that shipments to six missile and nuclear sites in China will require federal approval .
The sites -- which include research institutes -- were publicly identified last month , when their names and addresses were published in the Federal Register .
The move came the same week a select congressional committee , headed by Rep. Christopher Cox , R - Calif. , criticized the Commerce Department for not being vigilant enough in policing exports of technology to China .
In late 1995 , President Clinton decided to relax export controls on some high-performance computers and transferred responsibility for screening buyers of these computers from the government to exporters .
The White House promised to create a program to help them and began to compile a list of foreign military and nuclear sites that would still require federal approval .
The list first appeared in 1997 , with over a dozen sites , including some in Russia and India .
R. Roger Majak , the assistant secretary of commerce for Export Administration , said that of the six new entities on the list , most were added after American companies inquired about possible sales months ago .
He said that the delay in adding the six was caused by the administration 's desire to be cautious in labeling foreign sites , as well as by the process of getting consent from a handful of other federal agencies .
Gary Milhollin , the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control , a nonprofit watchdog group affiliated with the University of Wisconsin , said all six sites have long been known to be involved in nuclear or missile work and should have been on the list earlier .
In the wake of the release of the Cox Committee report on China 's acquisition of American technology , and as Congress begins to weigh its recommendations , the export of powerful computers has emerged as a particularly nettlesome issue .
Almost 150 advanced computers were sold to commercial buyers in China under the relaxed rules in 1996 and 1997 .
Hundreds more have been sold since then , but under tighter rules imposed by Congress .
Given the role of the state in China 's economy , it is not easy to tell whether China 's military gained access to technology bought by commercial customers .
Cox told a Senate hearing last month about China 's `` application of U.S. high-performance computers to nuclear weapons applications . ''
But Majak said that the administration 's position was : `` There is no evidence that any American computers have been used by China for nuclear weapons purposes . ''
On Thursday , the Senate Banking Committee , which has jurisdiction over export controls , is to hear from Cox and the select committee 's ranking Democrat , Norm Dicks , of Washington state .
The committee 's unanimous report included a recommendation that Congress renew the Export Administration Act , which expired in 1994 .
Last year , during Clinton 's visit to China , Beijing agreed for the first time to allow checks on American imports .
But the Cox Committee said the agreement was `` wholly inadequate '' in general and `` useless '' with regard to computers .
The administration , citing Beijing 's concerns about its sovereignty , did not allow the committee to disclose details of the agreement .
But a copy of the agreement , labeled `` secret , '' shows that inspections are left to the discretion of Beijing .
The agreement says that Chinese officials will conduct inspections `` on a case-by-case basis '' and `` if personnel and resources permit . ''
Officials from the U.S. Embassy `` will be invited , as necessary , to participate '' in the checks , it says .
Dan Hoydysh , the director of trade policy for Unisys Corp. , a computer manufacturer , said that some of the Cox Committee 's ideas were commendable , but its advice on what kinds of computers need to be strictly controlled was `` really outdated . ''
And he said the committee 's call for tighter inspections of advanced computers sold to China was `` not feasible '' because projected computer sales worldwide were `` literally in the hundreds of thousands . ''
On Friday , he and other computer executives are to meet at the White House with administration officials to discuss their concerns .
They are likely to find a receptive audience .
Soon after he took office in 1993 , Clinton wrote a computer executive that `` one reason I ran for president was to tailor export controls to the realization of a post- Cold War world . ''
Easing controls , Clinton added , `` can help unleash our companies to compete successfully in the global market . ''
The Cox Committee has raised the question of whether the Clinton administration 's emphasis on global competition has been consistent with American national security .
