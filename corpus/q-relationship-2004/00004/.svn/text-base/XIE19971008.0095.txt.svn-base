ANKARA , October 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Iraq 's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- has denied that it is sheltering Turkey 's Kurdish militants in northern Iraq , local newspaper Daily News reported today .
This was in response to news reports that Turkey 's outlawed Kurdish Workers ' Party militants , escaping Ankara 's cross-border attacks , have been taking refuge in PUK -controlled area in northern Iraq .
The paper quoted Shazad Said , a senior official at the PUK Ankara office , as claiming that the rumors had been spread by its arch rival in the region , the Kurdistan Democratic Party -LRB- KDP -RRB- .
PUK , led by Jalal Talabani , and KDP , under Massoud Barzani , were the two major Kurdish opposition groups in northern Iraq .
However they turned against each other and fought for the control of northern Iraq after President Saddam Hussein was rendered ineffective by allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War in exerting his influence there .
PUK , which favors continued armed struggle to topple the Saddam regime and is said to be supported by Iran , maintains a relaxed relationship with PKK militants .
Whereas KDP has softened its approach to Saddam and was reportedly supported by Baghdad in its turf war against PUK .
It has also been fighting alongside with Turkish government troops in northern Iraq against PKK militants over the past several months .
`` The KDP , which is now fighting the PKK , always spread rumors whenever they encountered failure , '' Said told the Daily News .
said .
Turkish Foreign Ministry stated in May that its massive cross-border military operation against the PKK rebels was carried out at the request of KDP .
KDP has kept silent on this issue .
PKK militants have been fighting a 13-year -old war for independence in southeastern Turkey .
Analysts here noted that press reports about PKK militants ' fleeing into PUK -controlled area may be a signal that Turkish troops might launch new attacks there .
Last month , Turkish government troops , backed by jets and artillery fire , entered northern Iraq to sweep PKK camps despite strong criticism from neighboring countries .
Earlier a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said that the ongoing offensive against PKK rebels was only `` a limited and routine one . ''
However , diplomatic sources here believe that the Turkish troops will stay in the area for a longer time .
