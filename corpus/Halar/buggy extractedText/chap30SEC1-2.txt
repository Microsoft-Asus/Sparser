GYMNOSPERMS

 

 The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms



 

 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers

The most familiar gymnosperms are the conifers, the cone-bearing plants such as pines. Gymnosperms (the term means "naked seeds") lack the enclosed chambers (ovaries) in which angiosperm ovules and seeds develop. Rather, gymnosperm ovules and seeds develop on the surfaces of specialized leaves called sporophylls. Gymnosperms appear in the fossil record much earlier than angiosperms.
