SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The Defense Ministry fired three navy and army commanders Thursday , holding them responsible for Sunday 's alleged North Korean spy incursion into South Korea .
The ministry also reprimanded two three-star generals for what it said was their failure to properly conduct the search for two supposed communist intruders .
The search , involving thousands of soldiers and police , was in its fifth fruitless day Thursday in the rugged mountains of the east coast .
A navy rear admiral , an army major general and an army brigadier general in charge of defending the east coast were relieved of their posts .
Their replacements were not immediately announced .
The sacking came one day after President Kim Dae -jung had scolded the military for failing to stop the alleged North Korean infiltration , the second reported in the area in less than a month .
The two men being sought are believed to be the companions of a suspected North Korean agent whose body was found washed ashore Sunday near a major naval base at Donghae , 195 kilometers -LRB- 117 miles -RRB- east of Seoul .
Found with and near the wet suit-clad body were a Czech -made machine gun , a hand grenade , a portable oxygen tank and a torpedo-shaped underwater propulsion device capable of carrying up to five scuba divers .
North Korea has denied the incident as a South Korean fabrication .
Discovery of the body came only three weeks after a small North Korean submarine was found entangled in a fishing net off the east coast .
Nine bodies were found in the Yugo -class sub , all shot to death in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide committed by senior officers to avoid capture .
At the border village of Panmunjom , the American -led U.N. Command filed a formal protest with North Korea over the alleged infiltrations Thursday , calling them `` grave '' armistice violations .
Lt. Gen. Ri Chan Bok , the chief North Korean delegate , `` criticized the United States and South Korea for trying to brand the wrecked submarine as ` intruder ' and conducting another anti- North Korean smear campaign with a dead body , '' the North 's official Korean Central News Agency said .
North Korea demanded an apology from Washington and Seoul , saying , `` The crewmen had no alternative but to kill themselves , unable to transmit SOS , '' when their sub went adrift with engine trouble and South Korean warships and aircraft attacked it and broke its aerial .
With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War , the Koreas remain technically in a state of war .
Their border is the world 's most heavily guarded , with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides .
