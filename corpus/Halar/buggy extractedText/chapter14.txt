Eyes of brown, blue, green, or gray; hair of black, brown, blond, or red--these are just a few examples of heritable variations that we may observe among individuals in a population. What genetic principles account for the transmission of such traits from parents to offspring?

One possible explanation of heredity is a "blending" hypothesis, the idea that genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes in a manner analogous to the way blue and yellow paints blend to make green. This hypothesis predicts that over many generations, a freely mating population will give rise to a uniform population of individuals. However, our everyday observations and the results of breeding experiments with animals and plants contradict such a prediction. The blending hypothesis also fails to explain other phenomena of inheritance, such as traits skipping a generation.

An alternative to the blending model is a "particulate" hypothesis of inheritance: the gene idea. According to this model, parents pass on discrete heritable units--genes--that retain their separate identities in offspring. An organism's collection of genes is more like a bucket of marbles than a pail of paint. Like marbles, genes can be sorted and passed along, generation after generation, in undiluted form.

Modern genetics had its genesis in an abbey garden, where a monk named Gregor Mendel documented a particulate mechanism of inheritance. In the painting on this page, Mendel works with his experimental organism, garden peas. Mendel developed his theory of inheritance several decades before the behavior of chromosomes was observed in the microscope and their significance understood. So in this chapter, we digress from the study of chromosomes to recount how Mendel arrived at his theory. We will also see how the Mendelian model applies to the inheritance of human variations.

Whereas peas are convenient subjects for genetic research, humans are not. The human generation span is about 20 years, and human parents produce relatively few offspring compared to peas and most other species. Furthermore, breeding experiments like the ones Mendel performed are unacceptable with humans. In spite of these difficulties, the study of human genetics continues to advance, powered by the incentive to understand our own inheritance. New techniques in molecular biology have led to many breakthrough discoveries, as we will see in Chapter 20, but basic Mendelism endures as the foundation of human genetics.





 Mendel brought an experimental and quantitative approach to genetics

Mendel grew up on his parents' small farm in a region of Austria that is now part of the Czech Republic. At school in this agricultural area, Mendel and the other children received agricultural training along with basic education. Later, Mendel overcame financial hardship and illness to excel in high school and at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute.

In 1843, Mendel entered an Augustinian monastery. After three years of theological studies, he was assigned to a school as a temporary teacher but failed the teacher's examination. An administrator sent Mendel to the University of Vienna, where he studied from 1851 to 1853. These were very important years for Mendel's development as a scientist. Two professors were especially influential. One was the physicist Doppler, who encouraged his students to learn science through experimentation and trained Mendel to use mathematics to help explain natural phenomena. The second was a botanist named Unger, who aroused Mendel's interest in the causes of variation in plants. These influences came together in Mendel's subsequent experiments with garden peas.

After attending the university, Mendel was assigned to teach at the Br&uuml;nn Modern School, where several teachers shared his enthusiasm for scientific research. At the monastery where Mendel lived, he also found stimulating colleagues, many of them university professors and active researchers. Moreover, there had been a long tradition of interest in the breeding of plants, including peas, at the monastery. Thus, it was probably not extraordinary when, around 1857, Mendel began breeding garden peas in the abbey garden in order to study inheritance. What was extraordinary was Mendel's fresh approach to very old questions about heredity.

Mendel probably chose to work with peas because they are available in many varieties. For example, one variety has purple flowers, while another variety has white flowers. Geneticists use the term character for a heritable feature, such as flower color, that varies among individuals. Each variant for a character, such as purple or white color for flowers, is called a trait.

The use of peas also gave Mendel strict control over which plants mated with which. The sex organs of a pea plant are in its flowers, and each pea flower has both male and female organs--stamens and carpel, respectively. In nature, the plants usually self-fertilize: Pollen grains released from the stamens land on the carpel of the same flower, and sperm from the pollen fertilize ova in the carpel. To achieve cross-pollination (fertilization between different plants), Mendel removed the immature stamens of a plant before they produced pollen and then dusted pollen from another plant onto the emasculated flowers (FIGURE 14.1). Each resulting zygote then developed into a plant embryo encased in a seed (pea). Whether ensuring self-pollination or executing artificial cross-pollination, Mendel could always be sure of the parentage of new seeds.

Fig 14-1. A genetic cross. To mate (hybridize) two varieties of pea plants, Mendel used an artist's brush to transfer sperm-bearing pollen from one plant to the egg-bearing carpel of another. In this example, the character of interest is flower color. When pollen from a white flower fertilizes ova of a purple flower, the first-generation hybrids all have purple flowers. The result is the same for the reciprocal cross, the transfer of pollen from purple flowers to white flowers.

Mendel chose to track only those characters that varied in an "either-or" rather than a "more-or-less" manner. For example, his plants had either purple flowers or white flowers; there was nothing intermediate between these two varieties. Had Mendel focused instead on characters that vary in a continuum among individuals--seed weight, for example--he would not have discovered the particulate nature of inheritance.

Mendel also made sure he started his experiments with varieties that were true-breeding, which means that when the plants self-pollinate, all their offspring are of the same variety. For example, a plant with purple flowers is true-breeding if the seeds produced by self-pollination all give rise to plants that also have purple flowers.

In a typical breeding experiment, Mendel would cross-pollinate two contrasting, true-breeding pea varieties--for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants (see FIGURE 14.1). This mating, or crossing, of two true-breeding varieties is called hybridization. The true-breeding parents are referred to as the P generation (parental generation), and their hybrid offspring are the F1 generation (first filial generation, the word filial from the Latin word for "son"). Allowing these F1 hybrids to self-pollinate produces an F2 generation (second filial generation). Mendel usually followed traits for at least these three generations: the P, F1, and F2 generations. Had Mendel stopped his experiments with the F1 generation, the basic patterns of inheritance would have eluded him. It was mainly Mendel's quantitative analysis of F2 plants that revealed the two fundamental principles of heredity that are now known as the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.





 By the law of segregation, the two alleles for a character are packaged into separate gametes

If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, intermediate between the two varieties of the P generation. Notice in FIGURE 14.1 that the experiment produced a very different result: The F1 offspring all had flowers just as purple as the purple-flowered parents. What happened to the white-flowered plants' genetic contribution to the hybrids? If it were lost, then the F1 plants could produce only purple-flowered offspring in the F2 generation. But when Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate and planted their seeds, the white-flower trait reappeared in the F2 generation. Mendel used very large sample sizes and kept accurate records of his results: 705 of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and 224 had white flowers. These data fit a ratio of about three purple to one white (FIGURE 14.2). Mendel reasoned that the heritable factor for white flowers did not disappear in the F1 plants, but only the purple-flower factor was affecting flower color in these hybrids. In Mendel's terminology, purple flower is a dominant trait and white flower is a recessive trait. The occurrence of white-flowered plants in the F2 generation was evidence that the heritable factor causing that recessive trait had not been diluted in any way by coexisting with the purple-flower factor in the F1 hybrids.

Fig 14-2. Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. When F1 hybrids were allowed to self-pollinate, or when they were cross-pollinated with other F1 hybrids, a 3:1 ratio of the two varieties occurred in the F2 generation. A genetic cross, or mating, is symbolized by &#160;X&#160;.

Mendel observed the same pattern of inheritance in six other characters, each represented by two different varieties (TABLE 14.1, p. 250). For example, the parental pea seeds either had a smooth, round shape or were wrinkled. When Mendel crossed his two true-breeding varieties, all the F1 hybrids produced round seeds; this is the dominant trait. In the F2 generation, 75%  of the seeds were round and 25%  were wrinkled--a 3:1 ratio, as in FIGURE 14.2. How did Mendel explain this pattern, which he consistently observed in his crosses? He developed a hypothesis that we can break down into four related ideas. (We will replace some of Mendel's original terms with modern words; for example, "gene" will be used in place of Mendel's "heritable factor.")

787:2772.84:1Alternative versions of genes (different alleles) account for variations in inherited characters. The gene for flower color, for example, exists in two versions, one for purple flowers and the other for white. These alternative versions of a gene are now called alleles (FIGURE 14.3). Today, we can relate this concept to chromosomes and DNA. As we mentioned in Chapter 13, each gene resides at a specific locus on a specific chromosome. The DNA at that locus, however, can vary somewhat in its sequence of nucleotides and hence in its information content. The purple-flower allele and the white-flower allele are two DNA variations possible at the flower-color locus on one of a pea plant's chromosomes.

Fig 14-3. Alleles, alternative versions of a gene. The gene for a particular inherited character, such as flower color in garden peas, resides at a specific locus (position) on a certain chromosome. Alleles are variants of that gene. In the case of peas, the flower-color gene exists in two versions: the allele for purple flowers and the allele for white flowers. This homologous pair of chromosomes represents an F1 hybrid, which inherited the allele for purple flowers from one parent and the allele for white flowers from the other parent.

For each character, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. Mendel made this deduction without knowing about the role of chromosomes, but what you learned about chromosomes in Chapter 13 will help you understand Mendel's idea. Recall that a diploid organism has homologous pairs of chromosomes, one chromosome of each pair inherited from each parent. Thus, a genetic locus is actually represented twice in a diploid cell. These homologous loci may have identical alleles, as in the true-breeding plants of Mendel's P generation. Or the two alleles may differ, as in the F1 hybrids. In the flower-color example, the hybrids inherited a purple-flower allele from one parent and a white-flower allele from the other parent (see FIGURE 14.3). This brings us to the third part of Mendel's hypothesis.

If the two alleles differ, then one, thedominant allele, is fully expressed in the organism's appearance; the other, therecessive allele, has no noticeable effect on the organism's appearance. According to this part of the hypothesis, Mendel's F1 plants had purple flowers because the allele for that variation is dominant and the allele for white flowers is recessive.

The two alleles for each character segregate (separate) during gamete production. Thus, an ovum and a sperm each get only one of the two alleles that are present in the somatic cells of the organism. In terms of chromosomes, this segregation corresponds to the distribution of homologous chromosomes to different gametes in meiosis. Note that if an organism has identical alleles for a particular character--that is, the organism is true-breeding for that character--then that allele exists in a single copy in all gametes. But if different alleles are present, as in the F1 hybrids, then 50%  of the gametes receive the dominant allele, while 50%  receive the recessive allele. It is this last part of the hypothesis, the separation of alleles into separate gametes, for which Mendel's law of segregation is named.

One test of Mendel's segregation hypothesis is whether or not it can account for the 3:1 ratio he observed in the F2 generation of his numerous crosses. The hypothesis predicts that the F1 hybrids will produce two classes of gametes. When alleles segregate, half the gametes receive a purple-flower allele, while the other half get a white-flower allele. During self-pollination, the gametes of these two classes unite randomly. An ovum with a purple-flower allele has an equal chance of being fertilized by a sperm with a purple-flower allele or one with a white-flower allele. Since the same is true for an ovum with a white-flower allele, there are a total of four equally likely combinations of sperm and ovum. FIGURE 14.4 illustrates these combinations using a type of diagram called a Punnett square, a handy device for predicting the results of a genetic cross between individuals of known genotype. Notice that we use a capital letter to symbolize a dominant allele and a lowercase letter for a recessive allele. In our example, P is the purple-flower allele, and p is the white-flower allele.

Fig 14-4. Mendel's law of segregation. A genetically specific version of FIGURE 14.2, this diagram illustrates Mendel's model for the inheritance of the alleles of a single gene. The purple-flower allele (P) is dominant, and the white-flower allele (p) is recessive. Each plant has two alleles for the gene controlling flower color, one allele inherited from each parent.

What will be the physical appearance of these F2 offspring? One-fourth of the plants have two alleles specifying purple flowers; clearly, these plants will have purple flowers. But one-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one allele for purple flowers and one allele for white flowers; like the F1 plants, these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait. Finally, one-fourth of the F2 plants have inherited two alleles specifying white flowers and will, in fact, express the recessive trait. Thus, Mendel's model accounts for the 3:1 ratio that he observed in the F2 generation.

Some Useful Genetic Vocabulary

An organism having a pair of identical alleles for a character is said to be homozygous for the gene controlling that character. A pea plant that is true-breeding for purple flowers (PP) is an example. Pea plants with white flowers are also homozygous, but for the recessive allele (pp). If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, as in the parental (P generation) cross of FIGURE 14.4, every offspring will have two different alleles--Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment. Organisms having two different alleles for a gene are said to be heterozygous for that gene. Unlike homozygotes, heterozygotes are not true-breeding, because they produce gametes having one or the other of the different alleles. We have seen that a Pp plant of the F1 generation will produce both purple-flowered and white-flowered offspring when it self-pollinates.

Because of dominance and recessiveness, an organism's traits do not always reveal its genetic composition. Therefore, we have to distinguish between an organism's traits, called its phenotype, and its genetic makeup, its genotype. In the case of flower color in peas, PP and Pp plants have the same phenotype (purple) but different genotypes. FIGURE 14.5 reviews these terms. Note that phenotype refers to physiological traits as well as traits relating directly to appearance. For example, there is a pea variety that lacks the normal trait of being able to self-pollinate. This physiological variation is a phenotype.

Fig 14-5. Genotype versus phenotype. Grouping F2 offspring from a cross for flower color according to phenotype results in the typical 3:1 ratio. In terms of genotype, however, there are actually two categories of purple-flowered plants: PP (homozygous) and Pp (heterozygous).

The Testcross

Suppose we have a pea plant that has purple flowers. We cannot tell from its flower color if this plant is homozygous or heterozygous because the genotypes PP and Pp result in the same phenotype. But if we cross this pea plant with one having white flowers, the appearance of the offspring will reveal the genotype of the purple-flowered parent (FIGURE 14.6). The genotype of the plant with white flowers is known: Because this is the recessive trait, the plant must be homozygous (pp). If all the offspring of the cross have purple flowers, then the other parent must be homozygous for the dominant allele; a PP&#160;X&#160;pp cross produces nothing but Pp offspring. But if both the purple and the white phenotypes appear among the offspring, then the purple-flowered parent must be heterozygous. The offspring of a Pp&#160;X&#160;pp cross will have a 1:1 phenotypic ratio. This breeding of a recessive homozygote with an organism of dominant phenotype but unknown genotype is called a testcross. It was devised by Mendel and continues to be an important tool of geneticists.

Fig 14-6. A testcross. A testcross is designed to reveal the genotype of an organism that exhibits a dominant trait, such as purple flowers in pea plants. Such an organism could be either homozygous for the dominant allele or heterozygous. The most efficient way to determine the genotype is to cross the organism with an individual expressing the recessive trait. Since the white-flowered parent must be homozygous, we can deduce the genotype of the purple-flowered parent by observing the phenotypes of the offspring.





 By the law of independent assortment, each pair of alleles segregates into gametes independently

Gregor Mendel derived the law of segregation by performing breeding experiments in which he followed only a single character, such as flower color. The F1 hybrids produced in such crosses are called monohybrids. What would happen if he followed two characters at the same time? For instance, two of the seven characters Mendel studied were seed color and seed shape. Seeds may be either yellow or green. They also may be either round (smooth) or wrinkled. From single-character crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seeds is dominant (Y) and that the allele for green seeds is recessive (y). For the seed-shape character, the allele for round is dominant (R), and the allele for wrinkled is recessive (r). Imagine crossing two true-breeding pea varieties differing in both of these characters--a parental cross between a plant with yellow-round seeds (YYRR) and a plant with green-wrinkled seeds (yyrr). The F1 plants will be dihybrids, heterozygous for both characters (YyRr). But are these two characters, seed color and seed shape, transmitted from parents to offspring as a package? Put another way, will the Y and R alleles always stay together, generation after generation? Or are seed color and seed shape inherited independently of each other? FIGURE 14.7 illustrates how a dihybrid cross, a cross between F1 dihybrids, can determine which of these two hypotheses is correct.

Fig 14-7. Testing two hypotheses for segregation in a dihybrid cross. A cross between true-breeding parent plants that differ in two characters produces F1 plants that are dihybrids: They are heterozygous for both characters. The F2 phenotypes show that the characters assort (segregate) independently. In this example, the two characters are seed color and seed shape. Yellow color (Y) and round shape (R) are dominant.

The F1 plants, of genotype YyRr, exhibit both dominant phenotypes, yellow seeds with round shapes, no matter which hypothesis is correct. The key step in the experiment is to see what happens when F1 plants self-pollinate to produce F2 offspring. If the hybrids must transmit their alleles in the same combinations in which they were inherited from the P generation, then there will only be two classes of gametes: YR and yr. This hypothesis predicts that the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 3:1, just as in a cross between monohybrids (see FIGURE 14.7a).

The alternative hypothesis is that the two pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other. In other words, genes are packaged into gametes in all possible allelic combinations, as long as each gamete has one allele for each gene. In our example, four classes of gametes would be produced in equal quantities: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. If sperm of four classes are mixed with ova of four classes, there will be 16 (4 &#160;X&#160; 4) equally probable ways in which the alleles can combine in the F2 generation, as shown in FIGURE 14.7b. These combinations make up four phenotypic categories with a ratio of 9:3:3:1 (nine yellow-round to three green-round to three yellow-wrinkled to one green-wrinkled). When Mendel did the experiment and "scored" (classified) the F2 offspring, he obtained a ratio of 315:108:101:32, which is approximately 9:3:3:1.

The experimental results supported the hypothesis that each character is independently inherited--that in the dihybrids (YyRr), the two alleles for seed color segregate independently of the two alleles for seed shape. Mendel tried his seven pea characters in various dihybrid combinations and always observed a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Notice in FIGURE 14.7b, however, that, if you consider the two characters separately, there is a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each: three yellow to one green; three round to one wrinkled. As far as a single character is concerned, the alleles segregate as if this were a monohybrid cross. The independent segregation of each pair of alleles during gamete formation is now called Mendel's law of independent assortment.





 Mendelian inheritance reflects rules of probability

Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins or rolling dice. A basic understanding of these rules of chance is essential for genetic analysis.

The probability scale ranges from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1, while an event that is certain not to occur has a probability of 0. With a two-headed coin, the probability of tossing heads is 1, and the probability of tossing tails is 0. With a normal coin, the chance of tossing heads is 1/2, and the chance of tossing tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling the number 3 with a die, which is six-sided, is 1/6. The probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event must add up to 1. With a die, the chance of rolling a number other than 3 is 5/6.

We can learn an important lesson about probability from tossing a coin. For every toss, the probability of heads is 1/2. The outcome of any particular toss is unaffected by what has happened on previous trials. We refer to phenomena such as successive coin tosses, or simultaneous tosses of several coins, as independent events. The question of whether a tossed coin will come up heads or tails is analogous to the question of whether a gamete produced by a Pp heterozygote will carry allele P or allele p (FIGURE 14.8). In every fertilization involving such gametes, the ovum has a 1/2 chance of carrying the dominant allele and a 1/2 chance of carrying the recessive allele. The same odds apply to the sperm cell. Like two separate coin tosses, allele segregation during formation of the sperm and ovum occurs as two independent events.

Fig 14-8. Segregation of alleles and fertilization as chance events. When a heterozygote (Pp) forms gametes, segregation of alleles is like the toss of a coin. We can determine the probability for any genotype among the offspring of two heterozygotes, as explained in the text.

We can use our understanding of independent events to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. Two basic laws of probability that can help us in games of chance and in solving genetic problems are the rule of multiplication and the rule of addition.

The Rule of Multiplication

What is the chance that two coins tossed simultaneously will land heads up? More generally, how do we determine the chance that two or more independent events will occur together in some specific combination? The solution is in computing the probability for each independent event, then multiplying these individual probabilities to obtain the overall probability of these events occurring together. By this rule of multiplication, the probability that both coins will land heads up is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4. An F1 monohybrid cross is analogous to this game of chance. With flower color in pea plants as the heritable character, the genotype of a given F1 plant is Pp. What is the probability that a particular F2 plant will have white flowers? For this to happen, both the ovum and the sperm must carry the p allele, so we invoke the rule of multiplication. Segregation in the heterozygous plant is like flipping a coin. The probability that an ovum will have the p allele is 1/2. The chance that a sperm will have the p allele is 1/2. Thus, the probability that two p alleles will come together at fertilization is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4, equivalent to the probability that two independently tossed coins will land heads up (see the Punnett square in FIGURE 14.8).

We can also apply the rule of multiplication to dihybrid crosses, such as the one shown in FIGURE 14.7b. For a parent with the genotype YyRr, the probability that a gamete will carry the Y and R alleles is 1/4. We can use the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of specific genotypes in the F2 generation without having to construct a 16-part Punnett square. For example, the probability of an F2 plant having the genotype YYRR is 1/16 (1/4 chance for a YR ovum &#160;X&#160; 1/4 chance for a YR sperm). This corresponds to the top box in the Punnett square of FIGURE 14.7b.

The Rule of Addition

What is the probability that an F2 plant from a monohybrid cross will be heterozygous? Notice in FIGURE 14.8 that there are two ways F1 gametes can combine to produce a heterozygous result. The dominant allele can come from the ovum and the recessive allele from the sperm, or vice versa. By the rule of addition, the probability of an event that can occur in two or more different ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of those ways. Using this rule, we can calculate the probability of an F2 heterozygote as 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Using Rules of Probability to Solve Genetics Problems

We can combine the rules of multiplication and addition to solve complex problems in Mendelian genetics. For instance, imagine a cross of two pea varieties that differ in three characters--a trihybrid cross. Suppose we cross a trihybrid with purple flowers and yellow, round seeds (heterozygous for all three genes) with a plant with purple flowers and green, wrinkled seeds (heterozygous for flower color but homozygous recessive for the other two characters). Using Mendelian symbols, our cross is
PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr

Let's use the rules of probability to calculate the fraction of offspring predicted to exhibit the recessive phenotypes for atleast two of the three traits. We can start by listing all genotypes that fulfill this condition: ppyyRr, ppYyrr, Ppyyrr, PPyyrr, and ppyyrr. (Because the condition is at least two recessive traits, this last genotype, which produces all three recessive phenotypes, counts.) Next, we use the rule of multiplication to calculate the probability for each of these genotypes from our PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr cross (that is, we multiply the individual probabilities for the allele pairs). Finally, we use the rule of addition to pool the probabilities for fulfilling the condition of at least two recessive traits as shown at the top of the next column.

ppyyRr&#188; (probability of PP) &#160;X&#160;&#189; (yy) &#160;X&#160; (Rr)= 1/16ppYyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16Ppyyrr&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 2/16PPyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16ppyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16 Chance of at least two recessive traits= 6/16 or 3/8With practice, you'll be able to apply the rules of probability to solve genetics problems faster than you could by filling in Punnett squares.





 Mendel discovered the particulate behavior of genes:

a review

If we plant a seed from the F2 generation of FIGURE 14.4, we cannot predict with certainty that the plant will yield white flowers, any more than we can predict with certainty that two tossed coins will both come up heads. What we cansay is that there is exactly a 1/4 chance that the plant will have white flowers. Stated another way, among a large sample of F2 plants, one-fourth (25% ) will have white flowers. Usually, the larger the sample size, the closer the results will conform to our predictions. The fact that Mendel counted so many offspring from his crosses suggests that he understood this statistical feature of inheritance and had a keen sense of the rules of chance.

Thus, Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles") that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability. This particulate theory of inheritance, first discovered in garden peas, is equally valid for figs, flies, fish, birds, and human beings. Mendel's impact endures, not only on genetics, but on all of science, as a case study of the power of scientific reasoning (hypothetico-deductive reasoning; see Chapter 1).





 The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely simple

In the 20th century, geneticists have extended Mendelian principles not only to diverse organisms, but also to patterns of inheritance more complex than Mendel actually described. It was brilliant (or lucky) that Mendel chose pea plant characters that turned out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character he studied is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant to the other.* But these conditions are not met by all heritable characters, not even in garden peas. The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely so simple. This does not diminish the utility of Mendelian genetics, for the basic principles of segregation and independent assortment apply even to more complex patterns of inheritance. In this section, we will extend Mendelian genetics to hereditary patterns that were not reported by Mendel.

Incomplete Dominance

The F1 offspring of Mendel's classic pea crosses always looked like one of the two parental varieties because of the complete dominance of one allele over another. But for some genes, there is incomplete dominance, where the F1 hybrids have an appearance somewhere in between the phenotypes of the two parental varieties. For instance, when red snapdragons are crossed with white snapdragons, all the F1 hybrids have pink flowers (FIGURE 14.9). This third phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes having less red pigment than the red homozygotes (unlike the situation in Mendel's pea plants, where the Pp heterozygotes make enough pigment for the flowers to be a purple color indistinguishable from those of PP plants). We should not, however, regard incomplete dominance as evidence for the blending hypothesis, which would predict that the red or white traits could never be retrieved from the pink hybrids. In fact, breeding the F1 hybrids produces F2 offspring with a phenotypic ratio of one red to two pink to one white. (Because heterozygotes have a separate phenotype, the genotypic and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation are the same, 1:2:1.) The segregation of the red-flower and white-flower alleles in the gametes produced by the pink-flowered plants confirms that the alleles for flower color are heritable factors that maintain their identity in the hybrids; that is, inheritance is particulate.

Fig 14-9. Incomplete dominance in snapdragon color. When red snapdragons are crossed with white ones, the F1 hybrids have pink flowers. Segregation of alleles into gametes of the F1 plants results in an F2 generation with a 1:2:1 ratio for both genotype and phenotype. CR = allele for red flower color; CW = allele for white flower color.

What Is a Dominant Allele?

Now that you have learned about incomplete dominance, let's reexamine the meaning of dominance and recessiveness. What is a dominant allele? Or, more importantly, what is it not?

In complete dominance, the situation described by Mendel, the phenotypes of the heterozygote and dominant homozygote are indistinguishable. This represents one extreme of a spectrum in the dominance/recessiveness relationships of alleles. At the other extreme is codominance, in which the two alleles affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways. One example is the existence of three different human blood groups called the M, N, and MN blood groups. These groupings are based on two specific molecules located on the surface of red blood cells. People of group M have one of these two types of molecules, and people of group N have the other type. Group MN is characterized by the presence of both molecules on red blood cells. What is the genetic basis of these phenotypes? A single gene locus, at which two allelic variations are possible, determines these blood groups. M individuals are homozygous for one allele; N individuals are homozygous for the other allele. A heterozygous condition results in the blood of the MN group.

Note that the MN phenotype is not intermediate between the M and N phenotypes; both the M and N phenotypes are individually expressed by the presence of the two types of molecules on red blood cells. In contrast, incomplete dominance is characterized by an intermediate phenotype, as in the pink flowers of snapdragon hybrids. Thus, the range of relative effects of two alleles includes complete dominance, codominance, and different degrees of incomplete dominance. These variations are reflected in the phenotypes of heterozygotes.

For any character, the dominance/recessiveness relationship we observe depends on the level at which we examine phenotype. For example, consider Tay-Sachs disease, an inherited disorder in humans. The brain cells of a baby with Tay-Sachs disease are unable to metabolize gangliosides, a type of lipid, because a crucial enzyme does not work properly. As the lipids accumulate in the brain, the brain cells gradually cease to function normally, leading to death. Only children who inherit two copies of the Tay-Sachs allele (homozygotes) have the disease. Thus, on the organismal level of normal versus Tay-Sachs phenotype, the Tay-Sachs allele qualifies as a recessive. At the biochemical level, however, we observe an intermediate phenotype characteristic of incomplete dominance: The enzyme deficiency that causes Tay-Sachs disease can be detected in heterozygotes, who have an activity level of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme that is intermediate between individuals homozygous for the normal allele and individuals with Tay-Sachs disease. Heterozygotes lack symptoms of the disease, apparently because half the normal amount of functional enzyme is sufficient to prevent lipid accumulation in the brain. In fact, heterozygous individuals produce equal numbers of normal and dysfunctional enzyme molecules. Thus, at the molecular level, the normal allele and the Tay-Sachs allele are codominant. As you can see, dominance/recessiveness relationships are rarely as straightforward as Mendel reported.

It is also important to understand that an allele is not termed dominant because it somehow subdues a recessive allele. Recall that alleles are simply variations in a gene's nucleotide sequence. When a dominant allele coexists with a recessive allele in a heterozygous genotype, they do not actually interact at all. It is in the pathway from genotype to phenotype that dominance and recessiveness come into play. We can use one of Mendel's characters--round versus wrinkled pea seed shape--as an example. The dominant allele codes for the synthesis of an enzyme that helps convert sugar to starch in the seed. The recessive allele codes for a defective form of this enzyme. Thus, in a recessive homozygote, sugar accumulates in the seed because it is not converted to starch. As the seed develops, the high sugar concentration causes the osmotic uptake of water, and the seed swells. When the mature seed dries, it develops wrinkles. In contrast, if a dominant allele is present, sugar is converted to starch, and the seeds do not wrinkle when they dry. One dominant allele results in enough of the enzyme to convert sugar to starch, and thus dominant homozygotes and heterozygotes have the same phenotype: round seeds. By exploring the mechanisms responsible for phenotype, we can demystify the concepts of dominance and recessiveness.

There is another important lesson about the meaning of the term dominance. Because an allele for a particular character is dominant does not necessarily mean that it is more common in a population than the recessive allele for that character. For example, about one baby out of 400 in the United States is born with extra fingers or toes, a condition known as polydactyly. The allele for polydactyly is dominant to the allele for five digits per appendage. In other words, 399 out of every 400 people are recessive homozygotes for this character; the recessive allele is far more prevalent than the dominant allele in the population. In Chapter 23, you will learn how the relative frequencies of alleles in a population are affected by natural selection.

Let's summarize three important points about dominance/recessiveness relationships:

1. They range from complete dominance, through various degrees of incomplete dominance, to codominance.

2. They reflect the mechanisms by which specific alleles are expressed in phenotype and do not involve the ability of one allele to subdue another at the level of the DNA.

3. They do not determine or correlate with the relative abundance of alleles in a population.

Multiple Alleles

Most genes actually exist in populations in more than two allelic forms. The ABO blood groups in humans are one example of multiple alleles of a single gene. There are four possible phenotypes for this character: A person's blood group may be either A, B, AB, or O (FIGURE 14.10a). These letters refer to two carbohydrates--the A substance and the B substance--that may be found on the surface of red blood cells. (These groups are based on blood-cell molecules different from those used for the MN classification discussed earlier.) A person's blood cells may have one substance or the other (type A or B), both (type AB), or neither (type O).

Fig 14-10. Multiple alleles for the ABO blood groups.

The four blood groups result from various combinations of three different alleles of one gene, symbolized as IA (for the A carbohydrate), IB (for B), and i (giving rise to neither A nor B). Because each person carries two alleles, six genotypes are possible (FIGURE 14.10b). Both the IA and the IB alleles are dominant to the i allele. Thus, IAIA and IAi individuals have type A blood, and IBIB and IBi individuals have type B. Recessive homozygotes, ii, have type O blood, because neither the A nor the B substance is produced. The IA and IB alleles are codominant; both are expressed in the phenotype of the IAIB heterozygote, who has type AB blood.

Matching compatible blood groups is critical for blood transfusions, because a person produces specific proteins called antibodies against foreign blood factors (FIGURE 14.10c). If the donor's blood has a factor (A or B) that is foreign to the recipient, antibodies produced by the recipient bind to the foreign molecules and cause the donated blood cells to clump together (FIGURE 14.10d). This agglutination (clumping) can kill the recipient.

Pleiotropy

So far, we have treated Mendelian inheritance as though each gene affects one phenotypic character. Most genes, however, have multiple phenotypic effects. The ability of a gene to affect an organism in many ways is called pleiotropy (from the Greek pleion, more). For example, pleiotropic alleles responsible for certain hereditary diseases in humans, such as sickle-cell disease, cause multiple symptoms (see FIGURE 14.15). Considering the intricate molecular and cellular interactions responsible for an organism's development, it is not surprising that a gene can affect a number of an organism's characteristics.

Fig 14-15. Pleiotropic effects of the sickle-cell allele in a homozygote. At the molecular level, the recessive allele responsible for sickle-cell disease has a single direct effect: It causes red blood cells to produce an abnormal version of the protein hemoglobin. An individual who inherits a sickle-cell allele from each parent has only the abnormal variety of hemoglobin. The abnormal hemoglobin deforms the red blood cells, starting a cascade of symptoms throughout the body.

Epistasis

Dominance, multiple alleles, and pleiotropy all involve the effects of alleles for single genes. We now turn to situations involving more than one gene. One such situation is epistasis (from the Greek for "stopping" or "causing to stand"), in which a gene at one locus alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at a second locus. An example will help clarify this concept. In mice and many other mammals, black coat color is dominant to brown. Let's designate B and b as the two alleles for this character. For a mouse to have brown fur, its genotype must be bb. But there is more to the story. A second gene, said to be epistatic to the first, determines whether or not pigment will be deposited in the hair. For this second gene, the dominant allele, symbolized by C (for color), results in the deposition of pigment. This allows either black or brown color, depending on the genotype at the first locus. But if the mouse is homozygous recessive for the second locus (cc), then the coat is white (albino), regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus.

What happens if we mate black mice that are heterozygous for both genes (BbCc)? Although the two genes affect the same phenotypic character (coat color), they follow the law of independent assortment (the two genes are inherited separately). Thus, our breeding experiment represents an F1 dihybrid cross, like those that produced a 9:3:3:1 ratio in Mendel's experiments. In the case of coat color, however, the ratio of phenotypes among F2 offspring is nine black to three brown to four white. FIGURE 14.11 uses a Punnett square to account for this ratio in terms of epistasis. Other types of epistatic interactions produce different ratios.

Fig 14-11. An example of epistasis. This Punnett square illustrates the genotypes and phenotypes predicted for offspring of matings between two black mice of genotype BbCc, where the C/cgene is epistatic to the B/b gene. One gene determines whether the coat will be black (dominant, B) or brown (recessive, b). The second gene controls whether or not pigment of any color will be deposited in the hair, with the allele for the presence of color (C) dominant to the allele for the absence of color (c). The epistatic relationship of the color gene to the black/brown gene results in an F2 phenotypic ratio of 9 black to 3 brown to 4 white.

Polygenic Inheritance

Mendel studied characters that could be classified on an either-or basis, such as purple versus white flower color. For many characters, however, such as human skin color and height, an either-or classification is impossible, because the characters vary in the population along a continuum (in gradations). These are called quantitative characters. Quantitative variation usually indicates polygenic inheritance, an additive effect of two or more genes on a single phenotypic character (the converse of pleiotropy, where a single gene affects several phenotypic characters).

There is evidence, for instance, that skin pigmentation in humans is controlled by at least three separately inherited genes (probably more, but we will simplify). Let's consider three genes, with a dark-skin allele for each gene (A, B, C) contributing one "unit" of darkness to the phenotype and being incompletely dominant to the other alleles (a, b, c). An AABBCC person would be very dark, while an aabbcc individual would be very light. An AaBbCc person would have skin of an intermediate shade. Because the alleles have a cumulative effect, the genotypes AaBbCc and AABbcc would make the same genetic contribution (three units) to skin darkness. FIGURE 14.12 shows how this polygenic inheritance could result in a bell-shaped curve, called a normal distribution, for skin darkness among the members of a hypothetical population. (You are probably familiar with the concept of a normal distribution for class curves of test scores.) Environmental factors, such as exposure to the sun, also affect the skin-color phenotype and help make the graph a smooth curve rather than a stairlike histogram.

Fig 14-12. A simplified model for polygenic inheritance of skin color. According to this model, three separately inherited genes affect the darkness of skin. For each gene, an allele for dark skin (A, B, C) is incompletely dominant to an allele for light skin (a, b, c), Thus, the heterozygous individuals (AaBbCc), represented by the two rectangles at the top of this figure, each carry three "units" of darkness. (Black dots symbolize dark-skin alleles.) Imagine a large number of matings between such heterozygotes. Along the top of the graph are the variations that can occur among offspring. The y axis represents the fractions of these variations among offspring of the matings. The resulting histogram is smoothed into a bell-shaped curve by environmental factors that affect skin color.

Nature and Nurture: The Environmental Impact on Phenotype

Phenotype depends on environment as well as on genes. A single tree, locked into its inherited genotype, has leaves that vary in size, shape, and greenness, depending on exposure to wind and sun. For humans, nutrition influences height, exercise alters build, sun-tanning darkens the skin, and experience improves performance on intelligence tests. Even identical twins, who are genetic equals, accumulate phenotypic differences as a result of their unique experiences.

Whether it is genes or the environment--nature or nurture--that most influences human characteristics is a very old and hotly contested debate that we will not attempt to settle here. We can say, however, that the product of a genotype is generally not a rigidly defined phenotype, but a range of phenotypic possibilities over which there may be variation due to environmental influence. This phenotypic range is called the norm of reaction for a genotype (FIGURE 14.13). There are cases where the norm of reaction has no breadth whatsoever; that is, a given genotype mandates a very specific phenotype. An example is the gene locus that determines a person's ABO blood group. In contrast, a person's blood count of red and white cells varies, depending on such factors as the altitude of one's home, the person's customary level of physical activity, and the presence of infectious agents.

Fig 14-13. The effect of environment on phenotype. The out-come of a genotype lies within its norm of reaction, a phenotypic range that depends on the environment in which the genotype is expressed. For example, hydrangea flowers of the same genetic variety range in color from blue-violet to pink, depending on the acidity of the soil.

Generally, norms of reaction are broadest for polygenic characters. Environment contributes to the quantitative nature of these characters, as we have seen in the continuous variation of skin color. Geneticists refer to such characters as multifactorial, meaning that many factors, both genetic and environmental, collectively influence phenotype.

Integrating a Mendelian View of Heredity and Variation

Over the past several pages, we have broadened our view of Mendelian inheritance by exploring incomplete dominance and other variations in dominance/recessiveness relationships, as well as multiple alleles, pleiotropy, polygenic inheritance, and the phenotypic impact of the environment. How can we integrate these refinements into a comprehensive theory of Mendelian genetics? The key is to make the transition from the reductionist emphasis on single genes and phenotypic characters to the idea of the organism as a whole, one of the themes of this book. In fact, the term phenotype does double duty. We have been using the word in the context of specific characters, such as flower color and blood group. But phenotype is also used to describe the organism in its entirety-- aspects of its physical appearance, internal anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Similarly, the term genotype can also refer to an organism's entire genetic makeup, not just its alleles for a single genetic locus. In most cases, a gene's impact on phenotype is affected by other genes and by the environment. In this integrated view of heredity and variation, an organism's phenotype reflects its overall genotype and unique environmental history.

Considering all that can occur in the pathway from genotype to phenotype, it is indeed impressive that Mendel could simplify the complexities to reveal the fundamental principles governing the transmission of individual genes from parents to offspring. By extending the principles of segregation and independent assortment to help explain such hereditary patterns as epistasis and quantitative characters, we begin to see how broadly Mendelism applies. From Mendel's abbey garden came a theory of particulate inheritance that anchors modern genetics. In the last section of this chapter, we will apply Mendelian genetics to human inheritance, especially the transmission of hereditary diseases.





 Pedigree analysis reveals Mendelian patterns in human inheritance

Unable to manipulate the mating patterns of people, geneticists must analyze the results of matings that have already occurred. As much information as possible is collected about a family's history for a particular trait, and this information is assembled into a family tree describing the interrelationships of parents and children across the generations--the family pedigree. A simple example of a pedigree appears in FIGURE 14.14a, which traces the occurrence of widow's peak (a pointed contour of the hairline on the forehead). The trait is due to a dominant allele, which we symbolize as W.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 14-14. Pedigree analysis. In these family trees, squares symbolize males and circles represent females. A horizontal line connecting a male and female (--) indicates a mating, with offspring listed below in their order of birth, from left to right. Shaded symbols stand for individuals with the trait being traced.

We know that all individuals in this family who lack a widow's peak are homozygous recessive, and thus we can fill in their genotypes on the pedigree (ww). We also know that both grandparents with widow's peaks are heterozygous (Ww); if they were homozygous dominant (WW), then all of their offspring would have widow's peaks. The offspring in this second generation who do have widow's peaks must also be heterozygous, because they are the products of Ww&#160;X&#160;ww matings. The third generation in this pedigree consists of two sisters. The one who has a widow's peak could be either homozygous (WW) or heterozygous (Ww), given what we know about the genotypes of her parents (both Ww).

FIGURE 14.14b is a pedigree of the same family, but this time we focus on a recessive trait, attached earlobes. We'll use f for the recessive allele and F for the dominant allele, which results in free earlobes. As you work your way through the pedigree, notice once again that you can apply what you have learned about Mendelian inheritance to fill in the genotypes for most individuals. (As you may have already guessed, the ears shown in FIGURE 14.14b do not actually belong to the women shown in FIGURE 14.14a. However, their earlobes would resemble those in the photographs.)

A pedigree not only helps us understand the past; it also helps us predict the future. Suppose that the couple represented in the second generation of FIGURE 14.14 decide to have one more child. What is the probability that the child will have a widow's peak? This is a Mendelian F1 cross (Ww&#160;X&#160;Ww), and thus the probability that a child will exhibit the dominant phenotype (widow's peak) is 3/4. What is the probability that the child will have attached earlobes? Again, we can treat this as a monohybrid cross (Ff&#160;X&#160;Ff), but this time we want to know the chance that the offspring will be homozygous recessive. The probability is 1/4. What is the chance that the child will have a widow's peak and attached earlobes? If the two pairs of alleles assort independently in this dihybrid problem (WwFf&#160;X&#160;WwFf), then we can use the rule of multiplication: 3/4 (chance of widow's peak) &#160;X&#160; 1/4 (chance of attached earlobes) = 3/16 (chance of widow's peak and attached earlobes).





 Many human disorders follow Mendelian patterns of inheritance

Pedigrees are a more serious matter when the alleles in question cause disabling or deadly hereditary diseases instead of innocuous human variations such as hairline or earlobe configuration. However, for disorders inherited as simple Mendelian traits, the same techniques of pedigree analysis apply.

Recessively Inherited Disorders

Thousands of genetic disorders are known to be inherited as simple recessive traits. These disorders range in severity from relatively mild, such as albinism (lack of pigmentation, which results in susceptibility to skin cancers and vision problems), to life-threatening, such as cystic fibrosis.

How can we account for the recessive behavior of the alleles causing these disorders? Recall that genes code for proteins of specific function. An allele that causes a genetic disorder codes either for a malfunctional protein or for no protein at all. In the case of disorders classified as recessive, heterozygotes are normal in phenotype because one copy of the "normal" allele produces a sufficient amount of the specific protein. Thus, a recessively inherited disorder shows up only in the homozygous individuals who inherit one recessive allele from each parent. We can symbolize the genotype of such people as aa, with individuals lacking the disorder being either AA or Aa.The heterozygotes (Aa), who are phenotypically normal with regard to the disorder, are called carriers of the disorder because they may transmit the recessive allele to their offspring.

Most people who have recessive disorders are born to parents of normal phenotype who are both carriers. A mating between two carriers corresponds to a Mendelian F1 cross (Aa&#160;X&#160;Aa), with the zygote having a 1/4 chance of inheriting a double dose of the recessive allele. A child of normal phenotype from such a cross has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier. (The genotypic ratio for the offspring is 1AA:2Aa:1aa. Thus, two out of three offspring with normal phenotype--AA or Aa--are predicted to be heterozygous carriers.) Recessive homozygotes could also result from Aa&#160;X&#160;aa and aa&#160;X&#160;aa matings, but if the disorder is lethal before reproductive age or results in sterility, no aa individuals will reproduce. Even if recessive homozygotes are able to reproduce, such individuals will still account for a much smaller percentage of the population than heterozygous carriers, for reasons we will examine in Chapter 23.

In general, a genetic disorder is not evenly distributed among all groups of humans. These disparities result from the different genetic histories of the world's peoples during less technological times, when populations were more geographically (and hence genetically) isolated. We will now examine three examples of recessively inherited disorders.

The most common lethal genetic disease in the United States is cystic fibrosis, which strikes one out of every 2,500 whites of European descent but is much rarer in other groups. One out of 25 whites (4% ) is a carrier. The normal allele for this gene codes for a membrane protein that functions in chloride ion transport between certain cells and the extracellular fluid. These chloride channels are defective or absent in the plasma membranes of children who have inherited two of the recessive alleles that cause cystic fibrosis. The result is an abnormally high concentration of extracellular chloride, which causes the mucus that coats certain cells to become thicker and stickier than normal. The mucus builds up in the pancreas, lungs, digestive tract, and other organs, a condition that favors bacterial infections. Recent research indicates that the extracellular chloride also contributes to infection by disabling a natural antibiotic made by some body cells. When immune cells come to the rescue, their remains add to the mucus, creating a vicious cycle. Untreated, most children with cystic fibrosis die before their fifth birthday. Gentle pounding on the chest to clear mucus from clogged airways, daily doses of antibiotics to prevent infection, and other preventive treatments can prolong life. In the United States, more than half of the people with cystic fibrosis now survive into their late 20s or beyond.

Another lethal disorder inherited as a recessive allele is Tay-Sachs disease, described earlier in the chapter. Recall that the disease is caused by a dysfunctional enzyme that fails to break down brain lipids of a certain class. The symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease usually become manifest a few months after birth. The infant begins to suffer seizures, blindness, and degeneration of motor and mental performance. Inevitably, the child dies within a few years. There is a disproportionately high incidence of Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazic Jews, Jewish people whose ancestors lived in central Europe. In that population, the frequency of Tay-Sachs disease is one out of 3,600 births, about 100 times greater than the incidence among non-Jews or Mediterranean (Sephardic) Jews.

The most common inherited disease among blacks is sickle-cell disease,which affects one out of 400 African Americans. Sickle-cell disease is caused by the substitution of a single amino acid in the hemoglobin protein of red blood cells (see FIGURE 5.19). When the oxygen content of an affected individual's blood is low (at high altitudes or under physical stress, for instance), the sickle-cell hemoglobin molecules crystallize by aggregating into long rods. The crystals deform the red cells into a sickle shape. Sickling of the cells, in turn, can lead to other symptoms. The multiple effects of a double dose of the sickle-cell allele are an example of pleiotropy (FIGURE 14.15). Doctors now use regular blood transfusions to ward off brain damage in children with sickle-cell disease, and new drugs can help prevent or treat other problems, but there is no cure.

The non-sickle-cell counterpart of the sickle-cell allele is in fact only incompletely dominant to the sickle-cell allele at the level of the organism. Heterozygotes--carriers of a single sickle-cell allele--are said to have sickle-cell trait. Such people are usually healthy, although a fraction suffer some symptoms of sickle-cell disease when there is an extended reduction of blood oxygen. At the molecular level, the two alleles are codominant; both normal and abnormal hemoglobins are made.

About one out of ten African Americans has sickle-cell trait, an unusually high frequency of heterozygotes for an allele with severe detrimental effects in homozygotes. The reason for the prevalence of this allele appears to be that a single copy of the sickle-cell allele, while not usually producing sickle-cell symptoms, benefits the carrier by increasing resistance to malaria. The malaria parasite spends part of its life cycle in red blood cells (see FIGURE 28.13), and the presence of even heterozygous amounts of sickle-cell hemoglobin gives these cells an increased fragility that tends to interrupt the cycle. Thus, in tropical Africa, where malaria is common, the sickle-cell allele is both boon and bane. The relatively high frequency of African Americans with sickle-cell trait is a vestige of their African roots.

Although it is relatively unlikely that two carriers of the same rare harmful allele will meet and mate, the probability increases greatly if the man and woman are close relatives (for example, siblings or first cousins). These are called consanguineous ("same blood") matings, and they are indicated in pedigrees by double lines. Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits--including harmful ones. Such effects can be observed in many types of domesticated and zoo animals that have become inbred.

There is debate among geneticists about the extent to which human consanguinity increases the risk of inherited diseases. Many deleterious alleles have such severe effects that a homozygous embryo spontaneously aborts long before birth. Most societies and cultures have laws or taboos forbidding marriages between close relatives. These rules may have evolved out of empirical observation that in most populations, stillbirths and birth defects are more common when parents are closely related. But social and economic factors have also influenced the development of customs and laws against consanguineous marriages.

Dominantly Inherited Disorders

Although most harmful alleles are recessive, many human disorders are due to dominant alleles. One example is achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism with an incidence of one case among every 10,000 people. Heterozygous individuals have the dwarf phenotype. Therefore, all people who are not achondroplastic dwarfs--99.99%  of the population--are homozygous for the recessive allele.

Lethal dominant alleles are much less common than lethal recessives. Presumably, the two kinds of alleles arise by mutation (changes to the DNA) of a sperm or egg equally often. However, if a lethal dominant allele kills an offspring before it is mature and can reproduce, the allele will not be passed on to future generations. This is in contrast to what happens to lethal recessive mutations, which are perpetuated from generation to generation by the reproduction of heterozygous carriers who have normal phenotypes.

A lethal dominant allele can escape elimination if it is late-acting, causing death at a relatively advanced age. By the time the symptoms become evident, the individual may have already transmitted the lethal allele to his or her children. For example, Huntington's disease, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, is caused by a lethal dominant allele that has no obvious phenotypic effect until the individual is about 35 to 45 years old. Once the deterioration of the nervous system begins, it is irreversible and inevitably fatal. Any child born to a parent who has the allele for Huntington's disease has a 50%  chance of inheriting the allele and the disorder. (The mating can be symbolized as Aa&#160;X&#160;aa, with A being the dominant allele that causes Huntington's disease.) Until recently, it was impossible to tell before the onset of symptoms if a person at risk for Huntington's disease had actually inherited the allele, but that has changed. Analyzing DNA samples from a large family with a high incidence of the disorder, molecular geneticists have tracked the Huntington's allele to a locus near the tip of chromosome 4 (FIGURE 14.16). It is now possible to test for the presence of the allele in an individual's genome. (The methods that make such tests possible are discussed in Chapter 20.) For those with a family history of Huntington's disease, the availability of this test poses an agonizing dilemma: Under what circumstances is it beneficial for a presently healthy person to find out whether he or she has inherited a fatal and not yet curable disease?

Fig 14-16. Large families provide excellent case studies of human genetics. Here, Nancy Wexler, of Columbia University and the Hereditary Disease Foundation, studies a huge pedigree that traces Huntington's disease through several generations of one large family in Venezuela. Classical Mendelian analysis of this family, coupled with the techniques of molecular biology, enabled scientists to develop a test for the presence of the dominant allele that causes Huntington's disease--a test that can be used before symptoms appear. Dr. Wexler is herself at risk for developing Huntington's disease. Her mother died of the disorder, and there is a 50%  chance that Dr. Wexler inherited the dominant allele that causes the disease.

Multifactorial Disorders

The hereditary diseases we have discussed so far are sometimes described as simple Mendelian disorders because they result from certain alleles at a single genetic locus. Many more people are susceptible to diseases that have a multifactorial basis--a genetic component plus a significant environmental influence. The long list of multifactorial diseases includes heart disease, diabetes, cancer, alcoholism, and certain mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. In many cases, the hereditary component is polygenic. For example, many genes affect our cardiovascular health, making some of us more prone than others to heart attacks and strokes. But our lifestyle intervenes tremendously between genotype and phenotype for cardiovascular health and other multifactorial characters. Exercise, a healthful diet, abstinence from smoking, and an ability to put stressful situations in perspective all reduce our risk of heart disease and some types of cancer.

At present, so little is understood about the genetic contributions to most multifactorial diseases that the best public health strategy is to educate people about the importance of environmental factors and to promote healthful behavior.





 Technology is providing new tools for genetic testing and counseling

A preventive approach to simple Mendelian disorders is sometimes possible, because the risk that a particular genetic disorder will occur can sometimes be assessed before a child is conceived or during the early stages of the pregnancy. Many hospitals have genetic counselors who can provide information to prospective parents concerned about a family history for a specific disease.

Let's consider the case of a hypothetical couple, John and Carol, who are planning to have their first child and are seeking genetic counseling because of family histories of a lethal disease known to be recessively inherited. John and Carol each had a brother who died of the disorder, so they want to determine the risk of their having a child with the disease. From the information about their brothers, we know that both parents of John and both parents of Carol must have been carriers of the recessive allele. Thus, John and Carol are both products of Aa&#160;X&#160;Aa crosses, where a symbolizes the allele that causes this particular disease. We also know that John and Carol are not homozygous recessive (aa), because they do not have the disease. Therefore, their genotypes are either AA or Aa. Given a genotypic ratio of 1AA:2Aa:1aa for offspring of an Aa&#160;X&#160;Aacross, John and Carol each have a 2/3 chance of being carriers (Aa). Using the rule of multiplication, we can determine that the overall probability of their firstborn having the disorder is 2/3 (the chance that John is a carrier) multiplied by 2/3 (the chance that Carol is a carrier) multiplied by 1/4 (the chance of two carriers having a child with the disease), which equals 1/9. Suppose that Carol and John decide to take the risk and have a child--after all, there is an 8/9 chance that their baby will not have the disorder--but their child is born with the disease. We no longer have to guess about John's and Carol's genotypes. We now know that both John and Carol are, in fact, carriers. If the couple decides to have another child, they now know there is a 1/4 chance that the second child will have the disease.

When we use Mendel's laws to predict possible outcomes of matings, it is important to keep in mind that chance has no memory: Each child represents an independent event in the sense that its genotype is unaffected by the genotypes of older siblings. Suppose that John and Carol have three more children, and all three have the hypothetical hereditary disease. This is an unfortunate family, for there is only one chance in 64 (1/4 &#160;X&#160; 1/4 &#160;X&#160; 1/4) that such an outcome will occur. But this run of misfortune will in no way affect the result if John and Carol decide to have still another child. There is still a 1/4 chance that the additional child will have the disease and a 3/4 chance that it will not. Mendel's laws, remember, are simply rules of probability applied to heredity.

Carrier Recognition

Because most children with recessive disorders are born to parents with normal phenotypes, the key to assessing the genetic risk for a particular disease is determining whether the prospective parents are heterozygous carriers of the recessive trait. For some heritable disorders, there are now tests that can distinguish individuals of normal phenotype who are dominant homozygotes from those who are heterozygotes, and the number of such tests increases each year. Examples are tests that can identify carriers of the alleles for Tay-Sachs disease, sickle-cell disease, and the most common form of cystic fibrosis. On one hand, these tests enable people with family histories of genetic disorders to make informed decisions about having children. On the other hand, these new methods for genetic screening could be abused. If confidentiality is breached, will carriers be stigmatized? Will they be denied health or life insurance, even though they themselves are healthy? Will misinformed employers equate "carrier" with disease? And will sufficient genetic counseling be available to help a large number of individuals understand their test results?

New biotechnology offers possibilities of reducing human suffering, but not before key ethical issues are resolved. The dilemmas posed by human genetics reinforce one of this book's themes: the immense social implications of biology.

Fetal Testing

Suppose a couple learns that they are both Tay-Sachs carriers, but they decide to have a child anyway. Tests performed in conjunction with a technique known as amniocentesis can determine, beginning at the 14th to 16th week of pregnancy, whether the developing fetus has Tay-Sachs disease (FIGURE 14.17a). To perform this procedure, a physician inserts a needle into the uterus and extracts about 10 milliliters (mL) of amniotic fluid, the liquid that bathes the fetus. Some genetic disorders can be detected from the presence of certain chemicals in the amniotic fluid itself. Tests for other disorders, including Tay-Sachs disease, are performed on cells grown in the laboratory from the fetal cells that had been sloughed off into the amniotic fluid. These cultured cells can also be used for karyotyping to identify certain chromosomal defects (see FIGURE 13.3).

In an alternative technique called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)(FIGURE 14.17b) a physician inserts a narrow tube through the cervix into the uterus and suctions out a tiny sample of fetal tissue from the placenta, the organ that transmits nutrients and fetal wastes between the fetus and the mother. Because the cells of the chorionic villi of the placenta are proliferating rapidly, enough cells are undergoing mitosis to allow karyotyping to be carried out immediately, giving results within 24 hours. This is an advantage over amniocentesis, in which the cells must be cultured for several weeks before karyotyping. Another advantage of CVS is that it can be performed as early as the eighth to tenth week of pregnancy. However, CVS is not suitable for tests requiring amniotic fluid, and it is less widely available than amniocentesis. Recently, medical scientists have developed methods for isolating fetal cells that have escaped into the mother's blood. Although very few in number, these cells can be cultured and then tested.

Other techniques allow a physician to examine a fetus directly for major anatomical abnormalities. One such technique is ultrasound, which uses sound waves to produce an image of the fetus by a simple noninvasive procedure. This procedure, which is also used to locate the fetus during amniocentesis, has no known risk to either fetus or mother. With another technique, fetoscopy,a needle-thin tube containing a viewing scope and fiber optics (to transmit light) is inserted into the uterus.

In about 1%  of the cases, amniocentesis or fetoscopy causes complications, such as maternal bleeding or fetal death. Thus, these techniques are usually reserved for cases in which the risk of a genetic disorder or other type of birth defect is relatively great. If the fetal tests reveal a serious disorder, the parents face the difficult choice of terminating the pregnancy or preparing to care for a child with a genetic disorder.

Newborn Screening

Some genetic disorders can be detected at birth by simple tests that are now routinely performed in most hospitals in the United States. One screening program is for the recessively inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU), which occurs in about one out of every 10,000 to 15,000 births in the United States. Children with this disease cannot properly break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This compound and its by-product, phenylpyruvate, can accumulate to toxic levels in the blood, causing mental retardation. However, if the deficiency is detected in the newborn, a special diet low in phenylalanine can usually promote normal development and prevent retardation. Thus, screening newborns for PKU and other treatable disorders can be vitally important. Unfortunately, very few genetic disorders are treatable at the present time.

In this chapter, you have learned about the Mendelian model of inheritance and its application to human genetics. We owe the "gene idea," the concept of heritable factors transmitted according to simple rules of chance, to the elegant experiments of Gregor Mendel. Mendel's quantitative approach was foreign to the biology of his era, and even the few biologists who read his papers apparently overlooked the importance of his discoveries. It wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that Mendelian genetics was rediscovered by biologists studying the role of chromosomes in inheritance. In the next chapter, you will learn how Mendel's laws have their physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles and how the synthesis of Mendelism and a chromosome theory of inheritance catalyzed progress in genetics.
