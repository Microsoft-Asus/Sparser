AMMAN , Jordan --
Jordan crowned a new king on Sunday after Hussein bin Talal , ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom since 1952 and a man admired around the world as a champion of peace , succumbed at age 63 to the cancer that had ravaged him in his final days .
King Hussein died as his heart failed in an Amman hospital at 11 : 43 a.m. , 48 hours after he had been flown home unconscious from a clinic in the United States .
The palace said it had been his `` persistent wish '' to die on Jordanian soil .
Within two hours , in a somber yet seamless succession , the late king 's eldest son , now King Abdullah bin Hussein , appeared on television in his debut as Jordan 's new monarch to console a nation already in tears .
At the age of 37 , Abdullah , until two weeks ago an army major general , and still untested in the affairs of state , became the fourth leader of this small but strategically vital 76-year -old desert kingdom .
`` We will preserve the course that Hussein set , '' Abdullah said , as he announced his father 's death , with an openness that is unusual in the Middle East .
He promised to maintain the legacy that Hussein left after nearly a half-century on the throne .
`` Hussein was a father , a brother , to each of you , the same as he was my father , '' the new king said of the only leader most Jordanians have ever known .
`` Today , you are my brothers and sisters , and with you , I find sympathy and condolences under God . ''
As his crown prince , he named his half-brother Hamzeh , 18 , the eldest son of Queen Noor , in a gesture that appeared intended at least in part to solidify ranks within the royal family .
It was a day of genuine grief in Jordan , as people wept in the streets , mosques sounded with readings of sacred verses from the Koran , and mourners huddled in the rain outside the hospital where the late king 's body lay .
In capitals around the globe , heads of state paid tribute to the wisdom , courage and humility of a man some called one of the great figures of the 20th century .
`` Through good times and bad , through health and illness , he showed the power of a strong will applied to a worthy cause , '' President Clinton said in a statement from Washington .
Clinton said he believed that the late king `` will smile on us one more time '' when the Middle East is finally at peace .
Hussein is to be buried Monday on the grounds of Raghadan Palace , in Amman , among royal tombs that also house the bodies of his grandfather , King Abdullah I , who was Jordan 's first ruler , and King Talal , who ceded the throne when his son was a teenager .
An extraordinary array of world leaders , past and present , was heading to Jordan to attend the state funeral .
The group included Clinton and his wife , Hillary ; Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain ; and a host of Arab leaders including the Palestinian leader , Yasser Arafat .
From Israel , a delegation led by President Ezer Weizman will also include Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two former premiers -- Shimon Peres and Yitzak Shamir -- to honor a neighbor whose most lasting leap of faith may have been the peace he forged with Israel in 1994 .
During a reign that lasted nearly 47 years , Hussein lost half his kingdom to war with Israel in 1967 , and he fought off coups and assassination attempts .
But he emerged through the decades as a force for moderation in a region wracked by extremism -- often to the dismay of fellow Arabs who were appalled by the public and private overtures that finally brought peace with Israel .
Netanyahu , a sometime rival as well as a peace partner , called the late king `` a courageous leader , a loyal friend , a maker of peace . ''
A statement issued by Arafat 's Palestinian Authority said that with the king 's death `` we lost a leader of insight and enlightened thinking . ''
And President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , the only other Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel , praised the late king for his `` bravery . ''
The passing of the king left Jordan in the hands of a young monarch , Abdullah , who was thrust to prominence on Jan. 25 .
That day , in what proved to be a brief return home after six months of cancer treatment , the king named his son as crown prince , in place of his own brother , Hassan , who had held the post for 34 years .
That shift brought hints of discord within the royal court , and it raised questions about whether a King Abdullah would be capable of meeting the challenges of leadership in a country with a troubled economy and worrying neighbors .
In the days since , however , diplomats have said they have been heartened by signs of maturity from the young ruler , and by his strong signals that he intends to maintain his father 's commitment to a broader Middle East peace .
On Sunday , in his public appearances , King Abdullah wore a coal-black suit of mourning and a brilliant red keffiyeh headdress -- reflecting the ties both to the West and to fellow Arabs that , under Hussein , helped Jordan to play an important role .
Until his appointment as crown prince , he had not figured highly in speculation about which of Hussein 's sons might one day assume the throne .
Yet on Saturday , as his father lay dying , he was invested by Jordan 's Parliament with the full powers of the monarchy .
And on Sunday , Abdullah offered a gesture of family unity .
As he entered the chambers of Jordan 's Parliament , where he put his hand on the Koran and read a single-sentence oath of allegiance , he was accompanied by all other senior male members of the royal family , including his 51-year -old uncle , Prince Hassan .
In a poignant moment , the new king paused as he approached the podium , standing at full attention , his back to the audience , before a full-length portrait that showed his father in military dress as a young man .
The designation of Hamzeh as the new crown prince and heir to the throne is a departure from Hashemite tradition , in which a king is succeeded by his eldest son .
But it follows the example set by his father in 1965 , when he named Hassan as crown prince at a time when Abdullah was just 3 years old .
Abdullah 's son , Prince Hussein , is now only 4 .
But more important to the decision , Jordanian analysts said , may have been the wishes of King Hussein , who had treated Hamzeh as his personal favorite .
Because Crown Prince Hamzeh , unlike King Abdullah , is a son of Queen Noor , the late king 's fourth and final wife , the choice will almost certainly help to bond a royal family that has sometimes displayed divided loyalties .
Palace officials said that the queen and King Hussein 's children were all at his bedside at the time of his death .
The king had never regained consciousness since his return to Jordan on Friday from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , where doctors had concluded that they could do no more in his battle against non- Hodgkins lymphoma , the form of cancer that claimed his life .
The king had been kept on a respirator , the palace officials said , but progressive organ failure had already claimed his lungs , liver and sole remaining kidney , and finally on Sunday morning it stopped his heart and caused brain function to cease .
Jordan 's Cabinet met immediately to proclaim Abdullah as king , and news of the death and the ascension was announced swiftly on Jordanian television , which showed a portrait of the late king draped with the country 's flag .
The news of the announcement was preceded , as is customary in the Arab world , by readings from the Koran , the Muslim holy book .
It was not long before Abdullah delivered his television address , flanked by Jordanian flags and pictures of Hussein and of Abdullah 's wife , now Queen Rania .
`` This is God 's judgment and God 's will , '' Abdullah said .
`` God bless Hussein , the father , the brother , the commander and the man . ''
Even before he spoke , Jordanians had begun to pour out their grief .
First scores , then hundreds of people began arriving at the locked gates of the King Hussein Medical Center , abandoning cars behind police barriers blocks away and walking through chilling rain to stand beneath the portrait of the late king .
Among the crowd , a dark-skinned woman in traditional desert dress sobbed uncontrollably , comforted by red-eyed strangers from smart urban offices .
The crowds swelled , and young men pumped fists into the air , chanting `` Hussein !
Hussein !
Hussein ! ''
Across the country , all the usual radio and television programming was replaced by the mournful chanting of sacred verses from the Koran .
Though Jordan had been steeled for this moment for days , if not weeks , almost everyone here , from Cabinet ministers to Bedouin shepherds , appeared to be in shock .
`` Until now , we did not believe that he would die , '' said Muhammed Bahesh , a 24-year -old hotel clerk , his work clothes soaked through to the skin .
He had been standing outside the hospital entrance for hours , in the chance that he would catch a glimpse of the royal hearse leaving the closely guarded compound .
He never did .
Plans to transfer the king 's body to his former palace residence were deferred until early Monday .
The government announced that all offices would be closed for a week of national mourning .
Official three-day mourning periods were announced , too , in Egypt and Syria -- Arab neighbors that , in years past , have openly called for the king 's overthrow .
Syria has remained a fierce critic of the king 's peace with Israel .
But its government offered a conciliatory gesture on Sunday , announcing that a referendum scheduled for Monday , in which President Hafez al- Assad was to be elected to a fifth term in office , would be postponed for two days .
With scores of world leaders and other dignitaries heading to Jordan for the funeral , analysts of Middle Eastern affairs will be watching Arab delegations closely to see who attends and who does not .
The Saudi delegation is to be headed by Crown Prince Abdullah , whose presence will mark a fresh gesture of reconciliation toward Jordan , which angered the Saudis in 1990 by siding with Baghdad on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait .
Jordan has since turned its back on the Baghdad government , but Iraq , too , said it would send a high-level emissary , Vice President Taha Mohieddin Ma 'rouf .
Syria , however , is expected to be represented at a lower level , in what would be in part a protest at the presence of the high-level Israeli delegation .
