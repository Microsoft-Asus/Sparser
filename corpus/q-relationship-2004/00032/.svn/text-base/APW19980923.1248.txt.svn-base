Settling the question of who controls Gibraltar -- a territorial dispute with Britain that has raged for more than two centuries -- is high on Spain 's agenda , the foreign minister told the U.N. General Assembly .
`` During the 1997 round of negotitaions , I submitted a proposal which would allow Spain to regain soveriegnty over Gibraltar , at the same time maintaining all the current advantages of the inhabitants of this territory , '' Abel Matutes said Wednesday .</ENAMEX>
The United Nations has played a role in many of the regional conflicts that have erupted in the aftermath of decolonization .
`` With the decade for decolonization about to end , I believe it is important to recall that the historic work performed by the -LRB- United Nations -RRB- in this field cannot be considered complete as long as colonial situations remain , '' Matutes said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` Every year , the General Assmebly renews its appeals to Spain and the United Kingdom to continue their negotiations with a view to putting an end to the colonial situation of Gibraltar . ''</ENAMEX>
