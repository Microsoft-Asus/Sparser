Toward the end of the 18th century Luigi Galvani discovered that frog muscle cells produce electricity, and in the 19th century Hermann von Helmholtz and others found that the electrical activity of nerve cells provides a means of carrying signals from one end of a cell to another and also between cells. Work over the past hundred years has shown that virtually all nerve signals are changes in the voltage across the plasma membranes of nerve cells. These voltage changes are caused by the movement of ions across the plasma membrane by way of specialized ion channels. Learning how these cellular processes work is central to an understanding of the nervous system. First we will examine the voltage gradient that exists across a cell’s plasma membrane.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
