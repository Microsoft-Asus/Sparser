Turkish and U.S. officials were set to leave Monday on a joint mission to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to lobby for oil and gas pipelines across the Caspian Sea to Turkey , the foreign minister said .
Both countries have been campaigning for an oil pipeline running from Azerbaijan 's capital , Baku , through Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan , as well as a pipeline to carry Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey .
The projects are among a number of proposed pipelines for transporting oil and gas in the region .
President Clinton 's adviser for the former Soviet republics , Richard Morningstar , will carry messages from Clinton to the leaders of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told reporters .
The United States favors pipeline routes to Turkey because of its strong opposition to any plans to transport Caspian Sea oil and gas to markets through Iran , a country which Washington considers unreliable .
