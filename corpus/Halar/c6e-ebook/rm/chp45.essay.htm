									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">Growth hormone (GH) produced by DNA technology has enabled hundreds of children who suffer from pituitary dwarfism to grow normally and reach a stature within the normal range. Now that the hormone is readily available and relatively inexpensive, many parents who are concerned that their children are not growing fast enough want to use GH to make them grow faster and taller. There can be potentially harmful effects, such as a reduction in body fat and an increase in muscle mass. And no one yet knows if GH injections will have seriously harmful long-term effects in individuals who do not have a hypopituitary condition. What criteria do you think should determine the cases in which GH treatments or other hormone therapies are appropriate?</p>
