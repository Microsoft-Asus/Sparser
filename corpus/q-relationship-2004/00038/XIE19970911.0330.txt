NEW YORK , September 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Major automakers in the United States have urged the administration to take action against South Korea , blaming the latter for limiting access to its auto market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">They expressed this in a letter to President Bill Clinton on September 9 , the American Automobile Manufacturers Association -LRB- AAMA -RRB- said in a press statement released from Washington today .
The letter , signed by chief executive officers of AAMA and its three members , namely Chrysler , Ford Motor and General Motors , said they wish to express their `` growing frustration '' over South Korea 's failure to honor its market opening commitments under its 1995 automobile trade agreement with the U.S</ENAMEX>.. <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The situation is `` unacceptable '' when South Korea combined closed domestic market `` with government-directed policies to promote an extraordinary expansion of excess automobile capacity for export to open markets in the U.S. and around the world , '' the letter said .</ENAMEX>
In 1996 , the three U.S. auto giants sold only 3900 vehicles to South Korea which has a auto market of 1.6 million vehicles , while in 1997 , `` the Korean government has not taken any positive action to promote imports . ''
The letter said the automakers believe that South Korea 's maintenance of a sanctuary auto market is directly fueling its auto industry 's `` aggressive international expansion '' .
On the basis of 3.6 million units turnout in 1996 , the country has planned to raise production to over 6 million units annually by 2000 , it said .
`` Allowing Korea to maintain a closed market while building huge auto assembly capacity potentially will result in the permanent loss of billions of dollars in U.S. automobile export , '' the letter charged .
`` We believe that the Korean government 's actions unquestionably deserve to be identified as priority practices that unfairly limit U.S. market access under Super 301 , '' the letter said , urging the administration to respond with `` serious and meaningful action . ''
