ANKARA , Turkey
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Weeks before an international consortium decides on the route of a pipeline to carry Caspian oil , the Turkish government Friday challenged the consortium 's report that the construction of a pipeline through Turkey was an expensive option .
Energy Ministry Undersecretary Yurdakul Yigitguden said a pipeline from Azerbaijan 's capital Baku to Turkey 's southern port Ceyhan would cost dlrs 2.3 billion according to a feasibility study prepared by Germany 's PLE Engineering .
The consortium forecast the cost of the 1,730-kilometer -LRB- 1,081- mile -RRB- pipeline at dlrs 3.7 billion .
Yigitguden claimed the consortium 's study was based on the possibility of high construction costs and other contingencies .
`` They are even calculating the length of the pipeline 240 kilometers -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- longer than ours , '' he said .
The consortium was reportedly opting for a shorter and cheaper pipeline running through the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa .
But Turkey has also declared that it will not allow its Bosporus strait , the sole maritime outlet from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean , to be used for the transport of oil because of the danger of collisions and oil spills in the narrow waterway .
Referring to differences in estimates , Yigitguden said `` the political support of the United States and Turkey in this unstable region cannot be compared with money . ''
The United States is actively lobbying for Turkey in an apparent effort to keep Russia 's influence over former Soviet republics at bay .
The Baku - Ceyhan pipeline will bypass both Russia and Iran and bring the Caspian region closer to the West .
