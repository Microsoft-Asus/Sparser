BRUSSELS , May 10 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The European Commission -LRB- EC -RRB- said today it is resorting to the World Trade Organization in order to open up the telecommunications procurement market in South Korea .
According to the EC , exporters in the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- lose an estimated 900 million US$ a year by being excluded from the Korean market .
The Commission , said a EC spokesman , has therefore requested formal consultations in the WTO against Korean measures designed to build up a domestic telecoms industry .
Korean law now requires the main national operator , Korea Telecom , to buy from Korean manufacturers , and the EC , said the spokesman , `` has clear indications that the second operator applies a similar policy '' .
He said the EC 's action had been carried out through the EU 's new `` market access '' strategy for opening foreign markets , and enjoyed `` wide support '' from EU governments and industry .
