AUSTIN , Texas --
Confronted by a shortage of high-security cells , Texas prison officials are ready to spend nearly $ 100 million to build 2,000 more cells to house disruptive convicts and prison gang members who have `` earned '' their way into solitary confinement .
Allan Polunsky , chairman of the prison system 's governing board , said the additional `` Super Max '' cells will allow officials to isolate gang members who have become increasingly disruptive in recent months .
`` That is definitely the plan , '' Polunsky said .
`` If I had my druthers , we would be building even more of these units .
These are not your normal gang punks that spray paint graffiti on expressway overpasses .
They are vicious killers , organized criminals , who have no respect for life -- theirs or anyone else 's . ''
Convicts in Super Max cells spend 23 hours a day locked up .
They leave the cells only for an hour of recreation by themselves .
`` By their behavior , they have earned the right to be housed in this type of unit , '' Polunsky said .
Wayne Scott , executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , said the system 's 8,000 administrative-segregation cells -- where gang members and other violent or incorrigible convicts are held -- reached capacity several days ago .
Since then , 120 additional cells at various prisons have been temporarily designated as segregation cells to handle the growing overflow .
But Scott said that is not a long-term solution .
`` Our administrative-segregation is built to house the kind of inmates that we have there , '' he said , `` and these other beds are not . ''
About 5,000 of the 8,000 administrative-segregation beds hold confirmed prison gang members , officials have said previously .
Under current rules , gang members are isolated to thwart communication with other gang members and to prevent gangs from congregating and victimizing other convicts .
Texas ' prison system holds about 143,000 convicts .
Approval of three additional high-security units -- at a cost of about $ 32 million each -- is expected to come Friday at a meeting in Dallas of the nine-member Texas Board of Criminal Justice .
The board last month approved construction of a fourth high-security prison , which , like the others , should be completed in about two years .
Housing 660 convicts each in single cells , the new units are to be built alongside existing prisons in Amarillo ; Iowa Park , near Wichita Falls ; Woodville , southeast of Lufkin in East Texas ; and Lamesa , south of Lubbock .
Allen Sailer , director of construction for the prison system , said the cost of the high-security units is about $ 54,000 a bed .
Less secure cells , for two convicts , constructed in recent years cost about $ 26,000 each .
But Scott and other prison officials said the new units are well worth the expense -- featuring computer-controlled doors and mechanical systems that improve security and lessen the risk of injury to guards and convicts .
Polunsky said the completion of the new units will give the prison system more flexibility in dealing with gang members and other convicts who need to be isolated from the general population .
`` The individuals who inhabit these cells have worked their way to those cells ... because they have been unable to adapt to the regimen of prison life in the general population , '' Polunsky said .
`` As the population of the system continues to harden , and with the phenomenon of the prison gangs , we are going to need more of these types of beds . ''
