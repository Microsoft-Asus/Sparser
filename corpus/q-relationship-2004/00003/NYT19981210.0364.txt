OSLO , Norway --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Protestant leader of Northern Ireland , David Trimble</ENAMEX> , accepted his share of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday and warned militant Roman Catholics against delays in turning over their arms caches .
Trimble acknowledged that splinter groups on the pro- British side had weapons , too .
But he said the Irish Republican Army and its political wing , Sinn Fein , were to blame for resurging tensions that have stalled the peace drive and that cast a pall over the awards Thursday .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">His Catholic counterpart , John Hume , who shared the prize , said Trimble was premature to insist on disarmament , because the accord provides two years to achieve it .</ENAMEX>
` The real issue about guns and arms is that they have been totally silent , ' <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , head of the Social Democratic and Labor Party</ENAMEX> , said .
He added that some militants linked disarmament to surrender , a `` psychological factor '' that he predicted would diminish with time .
Despite the recognition of continuing problems , the tone was one of thanks for obstacles surmounted .
`` It is now up to political leaders on all sides , '' Hume said , to deliver `` agreed structures for peace that will forever remove the underlying causes of violence and division on our island . ''
The laureates have come to personify hopes for peace in a province where 3,200 people have been killed in 30 years of conflict .
On May 22 a referendum overwhelmingly endorsed the accord .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble is first minister in the new provisional Assembly</ENAMEX> .
But he has threatened to put off forming the multi-party cabinet called for in the accord reached in April until paramilitary groups begin to hand in their weapons .
`` Any further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking from the clear water of democracy or still drinking from the dark stream of fascism , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble , head of the Ulster Unionist Party</ENAMEX> , told an audience of 1,000 at Oslo City Hall .
The disarmament issue is also blocking progress on prisoner releases and the creation of institutional bodies linking Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland to the south .
Francis Sejersted , chairman of the Nobel committee , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">praised both men but called Hume ` the architect of the peace process ' and a bridge to Catholic hard-liners without whom any agreement would be meaningless</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">While Trimble and Hume represent the largest mainstream parties in Northern Ireland , each must mollify extremists on his own side of the religious divide for peace to take root</ENAMEX> .
This week , John Taylor , deputy chief of Trimble 's Ulster Unionist Party , told The Irish Times that conflicting views on the way ahead posed `` a possibility of a major collapse . ''
