BEIJING --
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In a last-ditch effort to influence Taiwan 's presidential election , Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said Wednesday that the Chinese people were `` willing to use all their blood '' to prevent the island 's independence</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">But , at the same time , he played down a recent Chinese policy paper that threatened military action against the island if it delayed indefinitely talks on reunification , saying , `` There 's nothing new in there</ENAMEX> . ''
Taiwan , which holds its election on Saturday , dominated Zhu 's 90-minute news conference marking the end of this year 's session of parliament .
In language that was on balance more incendiary than calming , Zhu reiterated Beijing 's position on the island it considers a breakaway province .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">It was the last major opportunity in a month-long campaign by the Chinese government to use fighting words to pressure Taiwanese candidates and voters</ENAMEX> .
And Zhu made clear that the government has strong preferences .
`` No matter who comes into power in Taiwan , Taiwan will never be allowed to be independent , '' he said .
If the `` people who favor independence '' win , he later added , `` it may trigger a war between the two sides and undermine peace . ''
There were several such references to Chen Shui -bien , the presidential candidate whose opposition Democratic Progressive Party has advocated formal independence in the past , although Chen has moderated that position in this election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In recent days , Chinese officials and Communist Party newspapers have lobbed numerous thinly veiled attacks at Chen , saying he is `` tricking '' the Taiwanese and still at heart `` a separatist</ENAMEX> . ''
`` His mainland policy is merely a tactic to win the election , to pick up votes and deceive voters , '' said Xu Bodong , a Chinese foreign policy expert , on state television Wednesday .
Chen is in a tight three-way race for the presidency .
None of the candidates currently advocates a declaration of independence , and Beijing 's threatening words are aimed to keep it that way .
Zhu spoke with passion , but it was an odd role for the government 's leading economic reformer , who has never been its point person on Taiwan .
About half way through the news conference , the usually straight-talking prime minister seemed exasperated and refused to answer further questions on Taiwan , although reporters kept bringing up the subject .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- Again and again , Zhu repeated that China did not fear war , if it came to that .
And he lambasted foreign analysts who have recently argued that the Chinese military lacks the capability to take Taiwan .
`` They do not know the history of China and that the Chinese people will use all of their blood to defend the unity of the Chinese nation , '' he said .
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- On several occasions , Zhu declined to re-assure Taiwan that there would be no violence before or after the election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">For example , when a Taiwanese journalist asked if China plans to conduct military exercises this week near Taiwan , as it did four years ago in a bid to influence Taiwan 's last presidential election , he said : `` Let 's just wait and see</ENAMEX> .
But do n't worry too much , because there are only two days left . ''
But at other points , Zhu reiterated the government 's position that its goal is peaceful reunification with Taiwan , and said that the alarmed reaction abroad to the policy paper released last month was unwarranted .
Zhu said that document , which has angered some U.S. politicians to the point that they have pledged to fight China 's bid to enter the World Trade Organization , did not represent a shift to a more bellicose policy .
He said that position was first stated by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and accused anti- China forces `` in a certain nation '' of using an innocuous position paper that was meant to be a `` comprehensive and detailed exposition of China 's long standing policy '' to their political advantage .
Still , he expressed hope that the current tensions would not scuttle China 's entry to the WTO or damage relations with the United States .
He said he did not want to connect the Taiwan question `` with other issues related to China - U.S. relations . ''
In the brief interludes when Zhu managed to move away from talk of Taiwan , he solicited foreign investment for Chinese development projects , praised China 's current anti-corruption drive , and said the government would soon clarify its new policies on the Internet and telecommunications sector .
But he was at his most emotional on the issue of Taiwan , giving even declarations of brotherhood vaguely threatening undertones .
`` We trust that our Taiwanese compatriots will make a sensible choice '' in Saturday 's election , he said .
But he added that , if they did not , they might not `` get another opportunity . ''
