BEIJING --
This week at the Great Hall of the People , Chinese leaders threatened military action against Taiwan , warning that China `` would not sit idly by '' if the island it claims as its own moved toward formal independence .
But it was business as usual here at the Purple Vine , an elegant Taiwan -style teahouse run by a businessman from Taipei that is snuggled between the Great Hall and China 's leadership compound -- and counts many mainland officials as loyal customers .
`` The political tension has n't had the slightest impact on me , '' said Zha Fuhua , the owner , as he carefully choreographed the preparation of oolong tea , a Taiwanese favorite .
`` Sure there 's been lots of angry talk , '' he said , `` but I think it 's just mouthing off .
I 'm not the least bit worried .
I do n't think war is possible , because there 's too much to lose .
The essence of the relationship between China and Taiwan is economic development , not battle . ''
It might be easy to imagine that Beijing 's tens of thousands of residents from Taiwan live a bizarre existence , members of a divided family in the heart of the enemy camp .
There are occasional vexations : enduring an occasional cabbie 's harangue about the need to bomb Taiwan into submission and wondering how to respond when a teen-age son is invited to join the Communist Youth League .
But most Taiwanese here say that they are happy and feel at home in China , living with a language and culture that they for the most part understand .
They are mostly small-business people , and they blend in well with Beijing 's increasingly affluent middle class .
They have Chinese neighbors and Chinese business partners , and they often send their children to Chinese schools .
And so with only days to go before Taiwan 's presidential election , which has prompted Beijing 's most recent saber rattling , Taiwanese here seem largely oblivious to the arrows flying above them in political space , convinced that business interests and brotherhood will somehow ensure the peace .
`` We 're all used to this kind of talk by now , and it 's not something that impacts us greatly , '' said Lin Yen -hung , the manager of a huge cooking oil company on the outskirts of Beijing , who has lived here for eight years .
There are now an estimated 60,000 Taiwanese companies operating directly or indirectly in China , according to the Beijing Taiwanese Businesspeople 's Association , most drawn to the mainland by the opportunities of its fast-growing market .
At least several hundred thousand people from Taiwan now live in the People 's Republic , the overwhelming number in business .
In Beijing they are sprinkled throughout the city and integrated into the community .
Although many leave their families at home in Taiwan , as the standard of living here has risen an increasing proportion come with families in tow .
`` We express our views in an appropriate way , but in general we avoid the topic of reunification , '' said Chen Kuo -yuen , who owns a cafe and a leather goods factory .
`` Business is business and politics is politics .
But our relationship with the mainland community is extremely close . ''
He pointed to his cafe , filled with Chinese business people having power lunches on glass-topped tables .
`` My customers are Beijingers , '' he said .
`` My partner 's from here too .
If I tried to do it myself I 'd be quickly shut down . ''
The many business relationships that have evolved in recent years have various roots .
Taiwanese business people want to make money .
The Chinese partners have benefited from the managerial and technical skills that the Taiwanese bring .
And the Chinese government , which has established special concessions for Taiwanese businesses , believes that such ties will help reel the island , separated from the mainland since 1949 , into the fold .
Although Taiwanese and mainland figures vary , by both accounts Taiwanese trade and investment here are growing fast .
Bilateral trade amounted to $ 14.045 billion in the first seven months of 1999 , a 9 percent increase over the comparable period in 1998 , according to Taiwanese figures .
In 1998 there was nearly $ 3 billion in direct investment from Taiwan to the mainland , according to the China Statistical Yearbook .
But that probably vastly underestimates the magnitude of Taiwanese involvement , Chen said , since many Taiwanese invest in China through a third region , like Hong Kong .
And he said there was also a good deal of `` invisible '' investment , including his own cafe , in which money is invested in the name of a mainland partner because it is illegal for a foreigner to own that type of business in China .
Taiwanese here say the advantages of doing business in a familiar culture and language far outweigh the somewhat daunting prospect of dealing with an unfamiliar communist bureaucracy , one that spends vast amounts of time and effort maligning the leaders of their island homeland .
Many say they have tried , or thought of trying , to do business in Europe or the United States .
But they say they fear racial discrimination as well as huge language and cultural barriers .
In China they feel they have a leg up over the Westerners who are also rushing in .
`` When I first came to the mainland in 1992 , I felt some terror toward the Communist Party , '' said Lin , of Tongyi Edible Oil Co. , whose signs are written in the traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan instead of the simplified characters of the mainland , even though nearly all his employees are from the mainland .
`` But I easily became accustomed to how things work here , and I think it 's because we share many habits and customs in our lifestyles . ''
And so in the last few years , Taiwanese have continued to rush in , deaf to the near constant saber rattling in the background .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">People were far more nervous in 1996 , when China fired missiles near Taiwan during the island 's last presidential election campaign , the Taiwanese here say</ENAMEX> .
Then , $ 70 billion left Taiwan in one week and many Taiwanese , including Zha , the teahouse owner , started making preparations for their families to emigrate to the West .
But today the atmosphere is far more relaxed , they say , in part because of increasing communication and familiarity between the two sides , and in part because Chinese propaganda campaigns have changed their tone , no longer decrying oppression in Taiwan .
Tourists from Taiwan made more than 2.5 million visits to the mainland last year , up from about 500,000 a decade ago .
`` Three years ago if you got in a taxi and revealed you were from Taiwan , the driver would start ranting , '' said Zha , who moved to coastal China to start a seaweed business in 1987 .
`` But there are so many Taiwanese here now that there 's more contact and communication , so there 's also more understanding . ''
`` Generally people do n't bring it up , '' he said .
`` And anyway , if people ask , ` Where are you from ? '
I say , ` Jiangxi ' '' -- the southern Chinese province where his ancestors once lived .
Many Taiwanese here do not advertise their passports , and some routinely say they are from Singapore or Hong Kong .
In general it is easy for Taiwanese to live a life of `` strategic ambiguity '' by avoiding political discussions -- an easy maneuver in a country where the ruling Communist Party now has little obvious direct influence on everyday life .
Still , there are times when they feel forced to show their colors .
Lin , who has two children in school in Beijing , said his teen-age son grappled this year with whether to accept an invitation to join the Communist Youth League , a group that most teenagers join as much for its social as its political function .
-LRB- He did n't . -RRB-
And on the first day of school , Lin 's 6-year -old daughter found herself on stage being introduced by the principal , who proceeded to lecture the students about the inevitability of Taiwan 's return to the motherland .
`` She 's just a child , and I was very angry he had to bring politics into it , '' Lin said .
Although there have been no official polls , the Taiwanese here appear split among the three leading presidential candidates , just like Taiwanese voters at home .
And on the question of independence for Taiwan , most seem to favor maintaining the status quo , something resembling independence without a formal declaration .
Some predict reunification with the mainland at some point in the distant future , and all reject a quick bid for independence as too damaging for business .
The Chinese government `` from top to bottom '' has guaranteed Taiwan businessmen here that `` Taiwanese business would n't be affected by political tension , that there can be no threats or personal threats to business people here , '' said Chen .
Still , he said , the question of reunification is difficult for people like him , whose loyalties are split .
`` The vast majority of business people here would oppose any move to independence , '' he said , `` because it would immediately bring threats from the mainland .
But at the same time , they also oppose pressure from the mainland . ''
Then he added , with an apologetic look , `` I know that 's a cautious answer , but under the circumstances , it 's the best I can give . ''
