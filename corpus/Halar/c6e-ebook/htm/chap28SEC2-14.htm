The most complex cycles include an <span class="Emphasis2">alternation of generations,</span> the alternation of multicellular haploid forms and multicellular diploid forms. (Notice that haploid and diploid conditions alternate in <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> sexual life cycles--human gametes, for example, are a haploid stage--but the term <span class="Emphasis1">alternation of generations</span> is reserved for life cycles that include haploid and diploid stages that are both multicellular organisms.) As we will see in Chapter 29, alternation of generations also evolved in the life cycles of all plants.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">We can examine the brown alga <span class="Emphasis1">Laminaria</span> as an example of a complex life cycle with an alternation of generations. The diploid individual is called the <span class="Emphasis2">sporophyte</span> because it produces reproductive cells called spores (zoospores). The haploid individual is called the <span class="Emphasis2">gametophyte,</span> which is named for its production of gametes. Notice in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.21</span> (p. 564) that these two generations alternate--that is, they take turns producing one another. Spores released from the sporophyte develop into gametophytes, which in turn produce gametes. The union of two gametes (fertilization, or syngamy) results in a diploid zygote, which gives rise to a new sporophyte. In the case of <span class="Emphasis1">Laminaria</span>, the two generations are <span class="Emphasis2">heteromorphic,</span> meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes are structurally different. Other algal life cycles have an alternation of <span class="Emphasis2">isomorphic</span> generations, meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes look alike, although they differ in chromosome number.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-21','../fig/big/fig28-21.jpg','fig28-21');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-21.jpg" alt="fig28-21" name="myfig28-21"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-21.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The life cycle of <span class="Emphasis1">Laminaria</span>: an example of alternation of generations.</span></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
