-LRB- Distributed by New York Times Special Features -RRB- Terrorism is not a new phenomenon .
But today 's terrorists , be they international cults like Aum Shinrikyo or individual nihilists like the Unabomber , act on a greater variety of motives than ever before .
More ominously , terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear devices , germ dispensers , poison gas weapons and even computer viruses .
Also new is the world 's dependence on a nearly invisible and fragile network for distributing energy and information .
Long part of the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios , catastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a contingency that could happen next month .
Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism seriously , as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August , it is not yet prepared for the new threat of catastrophic terrorism .
American military superiority on the conventional battlefield pushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives .
The United States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its attempt to target chemical weapons .
Russia , storehouse of tens of thousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more , may be descending into turmoil .
Meanwhile , the combination of new technology and lethal force has made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and nuclear alternatives .
Technology is more accessible , and society is more vulnerable .
Elaborate international networks have developed among organized criminals , drug traffickers , arms dealers and money launderers , creating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the world .
The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds .
A successful attack with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands , or tens of thousands , of lives .
If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center had been nuclear , or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen , the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it .
Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event in American history .
It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America 's fundamental sense of security , as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949 .
Like Pearl Harbor , this event would divide our past and future into a before and after .
The United States might respond with draconian measures , scaling back civil liberties , allowing wider surveillance of citizens , detention of suspects and use of deadly force .
More violence could follow , either further terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks .
Belatedly , Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently .
The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against America and its allies is greater now than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 .
It is a national security problem that deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats of military nuclear attack or regional aggression .
The first obstacle to imagination is resignation .
The prospects may seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything useful .
Some are fatalistic , as if contemplating the possibility of a supernova .
Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the nuclear age , expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing any further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture .
But as with nuclear deterrence , the good news is that more can be done .
The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is complicated by `` placeless '' culprits , concealed weapons development and unconventional deployments , all of which are hard to monitor and preempt .
In cyberattacks , for example , the deployment of weapons can be entirely electronic .
The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to monitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have the motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction .
In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world , the United States should utilize remote sensing technology and cultivate global sources of information .
Necessary measures include clandestine collection of open sources , such as foreign newspapers and the Internet , as well as a full exchange of information with key allies .
Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the Aum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on civilians .
Although the Japanese media had reported the news , the U.S. government remained in the dark .
Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement agencies knew , but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware of what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered .
The parties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another attack .
To this day , U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform comprehensive planning for the collection of information , where the yields from overhead reconnaissance , electronic surveillance , clandestine agents , law-enforcement databases and informants , and reports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for maximum effect .
The intelligence job is hard but not impossible .
The would-be terrorists have problems as well .
If they are supported by a state , their organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and feckless .
If they are not backed by a state , the group may be small , feckless and pathological too .
These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success .
The national security agencies can seize the initiative .
Domestic law-enforcement officials , understandably , do not actively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on informants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal actions .
Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out and looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime .
On the other hand , domestic law enforcement has many techniques for gathering data , including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury investigations .
Much of what these efforts yield , however , is closed off to the national security community by law or regulation to safeguard constitutional rights .
The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence on catastrophic terrorism -- a National Terrorism Intelligence Center -- that would collect and analyze information so it could warn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time .
Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement data , it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency .
Instead , the National Center should incorporate the highly successful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism Center , which has a narrower mandate than this proposal , and be located in the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
However , the center would be run by an operating committee chaired by the director of central intelligence and including the director of the FBI , the deputy secretary of defense , the deputy attorney general , the deputy secretary of state and the deputy national security adviser .
The National Foreign Intelligence Program , which already provides support for the FBI 's National Security Division , would cover the center 's budget , while the National Security Council would take up unresolved disputes .
The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI and the CIA , and all intelligence organizations would provide a specified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel ceilings .
In short , the center would combine the active intelligence gathering approach of the national security agencies , which are not legally constrained in their foreign investigations , with the domestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement agencies .
This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for civil liberties .
The center would have no powers of arrest and prosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the traditional defense and intelligence agencies .
The center would also be subject to oversight from existing institutions , like the federal judiciary , the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , and the select intelligence committees of Congress .
Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign intelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law enforcement .
Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America 's future .
But the United States can fight back only if it sets the right goals .
In 1940 and 1941 , the U.S. government pondered what kind of forces it would need to wage a global war .
The answers went so far beyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in Washington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their rounds .
The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief .
The notion of an intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from the upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched in 1954 , when the U -2 program was born .
The films and cameras alone seemed an overwhelming hurdle .
A few years later the U -2s were flying ; six years later satellites were in place .
Similar stories could be told about the remarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast deployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of armored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992 .
America can meet new challenges , but it must first imagine success .
Only then can it organize itself to attain it .
