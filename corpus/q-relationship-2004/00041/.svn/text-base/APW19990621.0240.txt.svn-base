WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Amid protests from Cuban - American lawmakers , four U.S. officials met Monday in Havana with Cuban officials to discuss ways of improving counter-narcotics cooperation , a State Department official said .
Meetings between U.S. and Cuban officials on issues other than migration are rare but not unprecedented .
`` This is not a change in U.S. policy , '' said Michael Ranneberger , who heads the State Department 's office of Cuban affairs .
He said the meeting was taking place within guidelines for law enforcement efforts on counter-narcotics .
The U.S. team consisted of two State Department and two Coast Guard officials , none of whom holds a high rank .
They were to spend only one day in Cuba .
Monday 's meeting was aimed at elevating communications on counter-narcotics issues from an existing telex link to a phone link and other means , an official said , adding that the U.S. team had no plans to offer assistance to Cuba , to share intelligence or to discuss joint operations .
U.S. counter-drug specialists have become increasingly concerned about South American traffickers ' use of Cuban waters and air space to transport drugs to the United States , and the law enforcement community had requested that a team be sent , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Rep. Ileana Ros - Lehtinen , R - Fla. , objected strongly to the decision , saying it was ridiculous for the administration to give Cuban President Fidel Castro credibility on the drug issue .
She said Castro is notorious for helping drug traffickers .
Similar objections were voiced by Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart who , like Ros - Lehtinen , is a Cuban -born South Florida Republican .
In a telephone interview , Diaz - Balart said a grand jury in U.S. District Court in South Florida prepared an indictment against the Castro government concerning tons of cocaine that entered the United States .
The Clinton administration shelved the indictment in 1993 despite `` massive '' evidence of Cuban involvement with drug kingpins , the congressman said .
But Barry McCaffrey , the White House drug control policy chief , said last month that Cuba has shown a willingness to help the United States fight international drug trade .
Only a small portion of the drugs entering the United States come through Cuba , McCaffrey said , adding that the island 's location and a growing tourist market could make it an opportune target for drug traffickers .
McCaffrey also credited Cuba with acting on intelligence the United States provides to Cuban authorities .
Cuba lacks the resources to counter large drug-trafficking organizations , so drugs are routinely flown over Cuba or dumped in Cuban waters without effective resistance by local authorities , he said .
