Benefiting from a bumper harvest and wider cultivation , Afghanistan more than doubled its production of opium in the past year and now accounts for three-quarters of the world opium crop , according to a U.N. report issued Friday in Vienna , Austria .
The jump in production , to an estimated 5,060 tons from 2,310 last year , has alarmed the head of the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention , Pino Arlacchi .
Arlacchi said he had advised Secretary - General Kofi Annan that Afghan opium production was spinning out of control .
`` We need a policy for Afghanistan , '' Arlacchi said this week in a telephone interview from Moscow , where he has been discussing drug control with Russian officials .
`` We cannot stay and wait and see what happens . ''
He said Afghanistan 's record output could potentially flood Western Europe , the primary market for heroin refined from Afghan opium .
`` Seventy -five percent of the world 's production is simply not tolerable '' from Afghanistan , Arlacchi said .
Based on a customary 10-to-1 ratio for refining opium into heroin , the jump in production could mean as much as 270 additional tons of heroin on the world drug market in coming months , if the estimate is accurate .
Afghan traffickers have been encountering added difficulties in transporting opium after a smuggling crackdown by neighboring Iran .
Arlacchi said hundreds of tons of opium , and possibly some heroin , were believed stockpiled in Afghanistan .
In comparison , Myanmar , which for years was believed to be the leading opium producer , reaped an estimated 1,320 tons in the last year , said the survey , conducted for the U.N. International Drug Control Program in Vienna .
Arlacchi said Myanmar , formerly Burma , had reduced its output 8 to 10 percent over the last year .
Smaller quantities of opium were reportedly grown in Colombia , the source of most heroin that reaches New York City , and in Laos , Thailand and Pakistan .
Arlacchi said Afghanistan 's emergence as the leading producer confirmed a trend toward concentrating drug production in fewer countries , a factor that could make the threat simpler to combat .
Colombia produces most of the world 's cocaine and has increased its cultivation of coca leaf , while Peru and Bolivia have curtailed their plantings .
The U.N. survey reported opium poppy cultivation for the first time in Jawzjan and Kunduz Provinces of northern Afghanistan , meaning that opium is now grown in 18 of the 31 provinces .
Ninety -seven percent of the opium is cultivated in areas controlled by the Taliban , the militant Islamic movement that dominates the country .
The production increase follows heavy rains , hailstorms and earthquakes last year , problems that reduced the harvest by a quarter and led to failures in parts of central and southern Afghanistan .
Farmers scrambled to make up losses by planting more poppies and now have little incentive to scale back what has been a 43 percent increase in cultivation , the report found .
Afghanistan 's remote terrain , absence of an effective central government and continuing civil warfare have helped opium thrive .
The Taliban leadership has expressed disapproval of opium as contrary to Islam , but tolerates its cultivation as a cash crop and even levies an agricultural tax on it .
Arlacchi has contended that drug crops could be eradicated by having farmers substitute legal crops in return for development projects like schools , health clinics and roads .
The new survey reports that opium production in Afghanistan declined in the Maiwand , Ghorak and Khakrez districts , where the United Nations has introduced experimental programs in cooperation with local officials .
When Arlacchi visited Afghanistan in November 1997 , he asked Taliban leaders to crack down on opium production in return for development aid , but he says now that they have not followed through .
Arlacchi described Russian officials as extremely worried that profits generated by Afghan opium could be used by Islamic militants to destabilize Tajikistan and other neighbors in Central Asia .
He said he planned to ask the United States and other U.N. members to draft a strategy to block opium exports through the countries that border Afghanistan .
To compile its annual survey , the U.N. program employed Afghans to travel through rural areas where opium cultivation had been reported and to interview farmers and officials .
The United States takes a similarly pessimistic view of Afghanistan 's expanding production .
But its estimates , based on a different methodology that involves satellite imagery , are more conservative .
The State Department reported in March that Afghanistan produced 1,485 tons of opium in 1998 .
The department has not released its 1999 estimate .
