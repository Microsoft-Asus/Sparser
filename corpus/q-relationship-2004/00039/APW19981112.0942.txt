-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The leaders of Russia and Japan moved a few small steps closer Thursday to resolving a land dispute that has prevented them from formally signing a peace treaty to end World War II .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Dealing from their respective strengths , Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan opened his pocketbook , peeling off nearly dlrs 1 billion in loans and aid , while President Boris Yeltsin of Russia opened his borders , just a crack , in signals of good will in the dispute over the Kuril Islands .</ENAMEX>
The islands , just north of the main Japanese islands , were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II .
Japan has maintained that the seizure was illegal , and has refused to recognize Russia 's sovereignty over the islands .
The four Kurils are now so impoverished that some of their 17,000 Russian residents have taken up a petition asking that the islands be handed over to Japan .
But they are surrounded by prime fishing grounds that are coveted by both nations .
In the first formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to Russia in 25 years , Obuchi met Yeltsin at the Kremlin and was handed Russia 's long-awaited response to Japan 's proposals to settle the Kuril dispute .
The summit was Yeltsin 's first high-level meeting since his latest illness sidelined him a month ago .
He was shown on Russian television greeting the Japanese leader with a smile and handshake , appearing somewhat steadier than he has in public recently .
Later Thursday , Yeltsin unexpectedly canceled a dinner with Obuchi , sending Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov instead .
The Kremlin gave no explanation for the change of plans , but said it was not related to Yeltsin 's health .
No details of Yeltsin 's plan were released , but Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said it called for `` joint economic management '' of the islands .
Obuchi 's spokesman , Sadaaki Numata , said Japan would have no immediate response to the Russian proposal .
But , he said , `` I think we are solidly on the way ... to a peace treaty by 2000 . ''
He said Japan would formally respond at the next meeting of the two leaders .
He said Obuchi had invited Yeltsin to visit Japan `` at the earliest opportunity '' in 1999 , and Yeltsin had agreed .
In another step forward , the two leaders agreed to establish two new subcommittees -- one to seek a solution to the territorial dispute , and another to look into joint economic development of the islands .
`` There is a very strong interest on the Japanese side about the return of these islands , '' Numata said .
`` There is a very keen interest on the Russian side about the economic development or activities on the islands .
So we have these two committees working ... to meet these interests . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Japan agreed to bankroll the economic development of the islands with dlrs 100 million .
It also agreed to free up dlrs 800 million of a previously agreed-upon loan to Russia , and to give dlrs 10 million in medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to promote youth exchange programs .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Russia , in turn , agreed to a sentimental Japanese request to allow aging Japanese natives of the islands , driven out during the war , to return and see their old homes .</ENAMEX>
Although the meeting produced progress , a final agreement is expected to be a long , difficult process .
Tokyo received legal control of the islands now in contention -- Etorofu , Kunashiri , Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- in a treaty with Russia in 1875 .
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War II , a move Japan has protested ever since .
Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented Tokyo 's proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan in April .
The proposals have not been made public .
According to media reports , Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would recognize Japanese sovereignty over the islands , but would allow Russia to retain control for some time .
