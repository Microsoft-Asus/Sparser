The embryonic NASA of John Glenn 's heyday as a Mercury astronaut in the early 1960s pushed the envelope of human spaceflight , boldly teaching itself to pilot in a treacherous new realm and eventually to walk on the moon .
The middle-aged space program of today has long retreated from the lunar frontier and focused itself instead on filling the gap between the Earth and moon with a less glamorous international space station .
The two very different eras converge late this month when Glenn , now 77 and in the twilight of a lengthy U.S. Senate career , soars once again into space for a nine-day mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery .
On Feb. 20 , 1962 , Glenn made history when he became the first American to orbit the Earth , his only flight in five years with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
His encore will make him by far humanity 's oldest emissary in space .
Glenn 's solo Mercury flight established that an astronaut could cope with a nervous system turned upside down in the absence of gravity , retain sharpness of vision and be able to make decisions necessary to control and fly a spacecraft into unexplored territory .
With his second flight , Glenn plans to again play the role of medical subject , though not pilot , on behalf of an emerging scientific premise that there is a medical link between the physical stresses of space flight and those of aging .
His latest contribution , the senator believes , may awaken an aging national populace to the need for more research into the ailments shared temporarily by healthy young astronauts and the elderly .
They include weakened immune and cardiovascular systems , brittle bones , balance disorders and trouble sleeping .
`` I always wanted to go back up , '' Glenn said in January as his four-year , behind-the-scenes campaign in Washington to fly again bore fruit .
Cheered by the throngs who lined New York 's Wall Street for a ticker-tape parade and by a joint session of Congress after his three orbits of the Earth , Glenn believes his hero status prevented him from taking another mission .
`` It was overwhelming , a shock almost , '' Glenn said of the outpouring that dwarfed anything that contemporary shuttle crews receive .
`` There would be people crying along the street , sobbing and wiping their eyes .
`` Those were tenuous times we were living in , the competition with the Soviets , '' Glenn said of the early ' 60s-era boisterousness .
`` We look at that now and think , oh well , the Soviets are down the tubes and that was bound to happen .
But we did not know that then .
`` It was dog-eat-dog , '' Glenn recalled .
`` Americans had begun to doubt themselves as far as leadership in the world . ''
America 's space program sprung to life in the aftermath of the October 1957 launch of Sputnik , the first man-made satellite , by the former Soviet Union .
The United States was striding toward a decade of political assassination , racial strife and protracted combat in Southeast Asia .
The threat of nuclear annihilation from a face-off between the United States and the communist Soviet regime loomed profoundly over the globe .
If the Soviets could launch a satellite on a rocket , they could replace it with an atomic bomb aimed at the United States , policy-makers reasoned .
Domestically , the economy was robust as America entered the 1960s .
The three-martini lunch was fashionable .
Families gathered before their televisions to watch `` Wagon Train '' and `` Bonanza , '' a pair of westerns whose themes celebrated a vibrant , young nation settling its rugged frontier .
On the dance floor , the rage was the Twist , an aerobic oscillation in which the participants went nowhere .
Amid this invigorating chaos , the United States was also going to the moon .
Unprecedented in its risk and ambition , the expedition was intended to reveal a national might and grace greater than its superpower rival .
As the decade of the ' 60s opened , the United States was clearly behind in the space race .
The Soviets followed their success with Sputnik by launching the first human , cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , who circled the Earth once on April 12 , 1961 .
America 's first space traveler , the late Alan B. Shepard Jr. , followed Gagarin less than a month later with a more modest suborbital lob that spanned just 15 minutes .
Within days , then- President John F. Kennedy spoke to Congress , directing the nation to place an astronaut on the moon by the end of the decade .
The goal was achieved in July 1969 .
The program was called Apollo and was structured to build on the accomplishments of Glenn and his Mercury colleagues and those who participated in a second program called Gemini .
The moon quest galvanized America .
Kennedy battled with lawmakers for the privilege of increasing NASA funding , not cutting it .
`` The environment was one of anticipation , expectancy and one of doubt ; one of wanting proof the United States could compete with the Russians in space , '' said Christopher Kraft , who served as the NASA flight director for Glenn 's mission .
`` Those were tremendous days , particularly the flight of John Glenn , '' he said .
`` There was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment . ''
`` The -LRB- shuttle -RRB- flight of John Glenn has rekindled a spark that was there a long time ago .
He has inspired people , '' Kraft said .
`` They are inspired by his intestinal fortitude .
No matter how trite that might seem , it 's true . ''
-LRB- MORE -RRB- Today , with the Cold War long over , the competition that once justified large federal expenditures on space is absent .
As inheritor of the old Soviet space program , Russia has worked with the United States , Europe , Japan and Canada for the the construction of a new orbiting laboratory that would specialize in the kinds of medical studies and other kinds of research that Glenn now champions .
While NASA 's feisty administrator , Dan Goldin , urges his employees to think , `` faster , better , cheaper , '' first the White House , then Congress cuts the agency 's annual spending .
In response , NASA labors to keep its pledge of a new station afloat as its financially strapped Russian partners struggle to meet crucial commitments to its success .
The Soviet and then Russian influence that winds through four decades of U.S. space objectives frustrates many of NASA 's strongest supporters , who think the agency has become too much an arm of foreign policy .
`` In the 1960s , we were storming heaven .
We had a space program that was going someplace , '' said Robert Zubrin , a 46-year -old Colorado -based engineer , author and space activist .
His fourth-grade class watched on television 37 years ago as Kennedy announced plans for a human expedition to the moon .
He and his schoolmates tuned in again as Glenn lifted off .
`` We were going to be on the moon by 1970 .
We were going to be on Mars by 1980 .
We would be on our way to the stars by the turn of the century , '' Zubrin recalls .
`` It was an incredible invitation to adventure to every kid in the country .
Learn your science and you could become part of pioneering many new worlds . ''
`` I certainly bought into that , and I think millions of young people of my generation did , '' he said .
Building a space station is not bold enough for Zubrin , whose passion is Mars .
His 1996 book , `` The Case for Mars '' lays out a rationale for a 10-year effort to reach the Red Planet with American explorers and then colonize it .
Zubrin proposes a low-cost effort that would exploit the resources available on Mars to produce life support , food and rocket fuel .
The book also includes a political strategy for obtaining a presidential commitment after the turn of the century .
Unless America , either on its own or with the most capable international partners , begins to colonize space , its past accomplishments are likely to become no more than historical footnotes , he argues .
Zubrin is among a dozen serious contestants for the X - Prize , a $ 10 million offering to the first privately financed team to launch humans into space with a reusable rocket .
As a small aerospace contractor to NASA , he is developing equipment for future unmanned Mars probes that could demonstrate a capability to produce rocket fuel from the planet 's atmosphere .
Others believe , however , that it takes more than the inspiration that surrounded Kennedy 's call to the moon during the early 1960s to sustain human space exploration .
The end of the Cold War nearly a decade ago unalterably changed the equation for its justification , contends Alex Roland , who chairs Duke University 's History Department .
`` The Apollo program worked magnificently as Cold War propaganda , '' said Roland , who worked as a NASA historian during the period .
`` The whole space program , and the reason for putting astronauts in space at all , was part of the Cold War struggle .
A lot was riding on it , '' Roland recalled .
`` If -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- really could do things in this exciting realm sooner and better than we could , the suggestion was that the Red Star might be rising . ''
With its victory , America may have lost the principal justification for further investment in human space exploration .
`` The United States is now all by itself in pioneering this field .
That adds weight to the question of what is the urgency ? '' said Roland .
`` Does it make any difference whether we have a space station now or 30 years from now , whether we sent people to Mars now or 50 years from now or 100 years from now ?
`` You cannot make a compelling case why we have to spend this money now , '' he said .
`` Your budget gets eroded and that fundamentally is what has happened to NASA . ''
