Chapter 32: INTRODUCTION TO ANIMAL EVOLUTION

WHAT IS AN ANIMAL?

   Structure, nutrition, and life history define animals

   The animal kingdom probably evolved from a colonial, flagellated protist



Two Views of Animal Diversity

   The remodeling of phylogenetic trees illustrates the process of scientific inquiry

   The traditional phylogenetic tree of animals is based mainly on grades in body "plans"

   Molecular systematists are moving some branches around on the phylogenetic tree of animals



The Origins of Animal Diversity

   Most animal phyla originated in a relatively brief span of geologic time

   "Evo-devo" may clarify our understanding of the Cambrian diversification

Animal life began in Precambrian seas with the evolution of multicellular forms that lived by eating other organisms. This new way of life allowed the exploitation of previously untapped resources and led to an evolutionary radiation of diverse forms. Early animals populated the seas, fresh water, and eventually the land. In the above photo of a coral reef, the diver, the fish, and the various invertebrates (animals without backbones) are just a few examples of the diverse forms derived during the past half-billion years of animal evolution.

This chapter begins with the general characteristics of animals. We then discuss possible relationships among the animal phyla and examine hypotheses about the origin and early diversification of animals. This overview provides an orientation for our closer look at animal phyla in the next two chapters.
