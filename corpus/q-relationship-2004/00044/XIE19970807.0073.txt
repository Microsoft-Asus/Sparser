LAGOS , August 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Central Bank of Nigeria -LRB- CBN -RRB- and the police have expressed concern over the activities of advance fee frauds in the country and vowed to expose the perpetrators .
Speaking at a press conference here today , Alhaji Mahe Rasheed , CBN 's director of foreign operations , said that owing to the unscrupulous activities of the frauds , CBN had been exposed in 30 fraud cases all over the world .
He explained that the frauds operated by shady transfer of funds through over-invoicing , selling crude oil below market prices and posing as government officials while abroad .
The frauds solicited foreign businessmen through telex , forged official-looking documents , companies ' letter-heads and invoices .
They often used names and photographs of the CBN governor and other top executives to support their false claims .
The CBN has been sending some of its staves to courts overseas to defend its name in some of the cases .
Although some of the cases have been decided in favor of CBN , the advance fee fraud , widely known as a total of 419 activities , has seriously damaged the country 's image abroad , said Victor Moore , head of the legal unit of CBN .
The figure `` 419 is a cancer-like disease that continues to grow at an alarming proportion and poses a veritable source of embarrassment to the Nigerian business community , '' said Rasheed .
An average of 1,000 forged letters were seized annually by CBN with the aid of the Nigerian postal service , he added .
To curb the fraud activities , Nigeria 's head of state General Sani Abacha has appointed a special adviser on narcotics and advance fee fraud , while the police set up a special fraud unit .
The government has also established a money laundering surveillance unit and enacted a decree on advance fee fraud and control .
In her address , Victoria Waziri , commissioner of police for special fraud unit , disclosed that 25 advance fee fraud cases are currently being handled by the miscellaneous offenses tribunal with 80 persons standing trial .
Another 30 cases involving 100 suspects are before the magistrate courts in Lagos , while five more cases are pending at the Lagos High Court , she said .
Although the individuals involved in such cases are very rich and influential , the police is determined to combat the crime , she noted , adding that the cases of 419 have reduced considerably .
