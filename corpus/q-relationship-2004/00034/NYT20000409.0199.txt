SEOUL , South Korea --
In a major diplomatic effort to heal one of the Cold War 's last conflicts , the South Korean government announced Monday that North Korea had agreed to a June summit meeting between the two countries .
Officials said the meeting , which would be the first between heads of state of the two countries , would involve discussions of a wide range of issues separating the two Koreas , which have been left divided by a civil war since the 1950s .
At a hastily called news conference here Monday morning , officials said the issues to be discussed at the summit meeting from June 12 to 14 in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital , would include economic cooperation , reunification of separated families and political reconciliation .
`` It appears that North Korea decided that there could be no entry into the international community without some kind of reconciliation between the two Koreas , '' said Park Jie Won , minister of culture and tourism .
`` President Kim 's Berlin declaration appears to have created the momentum for such a meeting . ''
This was a reference to President Kim Dae Jung 's statement last month in the German capital that the leaders of the two Koreas should meet .
Plans for a 1994 summit meeting had to be scrapped when the North Korean leader , Kim Il Sung , died in July that year .
There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea of the summit plans , but officials here said that Pyongyang was expected to issue a statement in the coming hours .
The news is not only a major turnabout in the glacial state of mutual nonrecognition between the two countries , whose armies still face off across the 38th parallel .
It is also a huge political development in South Korea on the eve of Thursday 's critical mid-term legislative elections , which are seen as a referendum on Kim 's presidency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In recent weeks , the opposition Grand National Party has ridiculed Kim 's attempts at reconciliation with the North , which have included official encouragement of investments by South Korean corporations in the North to help revive that country 's near bankrupt economy .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Opposition leaders have accused Kim of being overly generous with his so-called Sunshine Policy , which has provided food and agricultural aid to the Communist North , but has also encouraged Washington and Tokyo to engage more with North Korea .</ENAMEX>
