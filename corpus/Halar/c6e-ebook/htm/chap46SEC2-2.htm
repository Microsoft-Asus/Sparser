Also common among invertebrates, <span class="Emphasis2">budding</span> involves new individuals splitting off from existing ones. For example, in certain cnidarians and tunicates, new individuals grow out from the body of a parent (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.1</span>). The offspring may either detach from the parent or remain joined, eventually forming extensive colonies. Stony corals, which may be more than 1 m across, are cnidarian colonies of several thousand connected individuals. In another form of asexual reproduction, some invertebrates release specialized groups of cells that can grow into new individuals. For example, the <span class="Emphasis2">gemmules</span> of sponges are formed when cells of several types migrate together within the sponge and become surrounded by a protective coat.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig46-1','../fig/big/fig46-1.jpg','fig46-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig46-1.jpg" alt="fig46-1" name="myfig46-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 46-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Two from one: asexual reproduction of a sea anemone <span class="Emphasis1">(Anthopleura elegantissima)</span>.</span> The individual in the center of this photograph is undergoing fission, a type of asexual reproduction.

For an animal to reproduce this way, fragmentation must be accompanied by <span class="Emphasis2">regeneration,</span> the regrowth of lost body parts. Reproduction by fragmentation and regeneration occurs in many sponges, cnidarians, polychaete annelids, and tunicates. Many animals can also replace lost appendages by regeneration--most sea stars can grow new arms when injured, for example--but this is not reproduction because new individuals are not created. In sea stars of the genus <span class="Emphasis1">Linckia</span>, a whole new individual may develop from an isolated arm. Thus, a single animal with five arms, if broken apart, could asexually give rise to five offspring.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Asexual reproduction has several potential advantages. For instance, it enables animals living in isolation to produce offspring without locating mates. It can also create numerous offspring in a short amount of time, which is ideal for colonizing a habitat rapidly. Theoretically, asexual reproduction is most advantageous in stable, favorable environments because it perpetuates successful genotypes precisely.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
