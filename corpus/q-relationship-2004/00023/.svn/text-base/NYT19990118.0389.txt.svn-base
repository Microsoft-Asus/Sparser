The report `` In the Firing Line , '' published last week by Amnesty International 's United Kingdom office , is a searing look at children in war zones .
It is a book almost too painful to read but one that should be digested by everyone , particulary military and political leaders .
Forced to serve as soldiers as young as age 10 , tortured and raped as prisoners and refugees , witness to the massacres of marauding armies , millions of children have lost their lives , or their minds , to adult destruction .
Amnesty International reports that in the past decade , 2 million children have been killed in wars while 6 million have been maimed , and 14 million are refugees or displaced persons .
The most chilling statistic : 300,000 children serve as combatants in armies .
Most of these child soldiers are ages 15 through 18 , but children have learned to kill at age 10 in Uganda .
In that country and others , including Rwanda , Liberia , Angola , Sierra Leone , Guatemala , and Afghanistan , children have been forced to perform `` initiation '' rites , killing friends , torturing other children , or burning down homes .
Stripped of familial love and inhibitions , often pumped up with drugs , the child soldier becomes a fearless killing machine or willing cannon fodder sent ahead to draw fire or test for land mines .
Amnesty International , along with a coalition of human rights groups , is calling for the nations of the world to raise the military recruitment age to 18 .
Forty -four countries , including the United States , recruit at age 17 or younger .
-LRB- US soldiers are not allowed in combat until age 18 . -RRB-
The United States should take the lead in the movement and should start by ratifying the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child -- a document that protects the civil and emotional rights of children .
Only the United States and Somalia have refused to ratify the convention .
A world that does not insist on the protection of its most vulnerable members cannot call itself civilized and sacrifices its future on the altar of grim expediency .
