 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate: a closer look

The word glycolysis means "splitting of sugar," and that is exactly what happens during this pathway. Glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is split into two three-carbon sugars. These smaller sugars are then oxidized and their remaining atoms rearranged to form two molecules of pyruvate. (Pyruvate is the ionized form of a three-carbon acid, pyruvic acid.)

As summarized in FIGURE 9.8 and described in detail in FIGURE 9.9 (pp. 162--163) the pathway of glycolysis consists of ten steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. We can divide these ten steps into two phases. The energy investment phase includes the first five steps, and the energy payoff phase includes the next five steps. During the energy investment phase, the cell actually spends ATP to phosphorylate the fuel molecules. This investment is repaid with dividends during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by oxidation of the food. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.

Notice in FIGURE 9.9 that all of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no CO2 is released during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not molecular oxygen (O2) is present. However, if oxygen is present, the energy stored in NADH can be converted to ATP energy by the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. And in the presence of oxygen, the chemical energy left in pyruvate can be extracted by the Krebs cycle.
