									<a name="para40"></a><p class="BlockText">You have seen that crossing over, or recombination, is thought to be evolutionarily advantageous because this process continually shuffles genetic alleles into novel combinations. Some organisms, however, have apparently lost the recombination mechanism, while in others certain chromosomes do not recombine. What factors do you think may favor reduced levels of recombination?</p>

									<a name="para48"></a><p class="BlockText">Opinions differ about whether children with learning disorders should be tested by karyotyping for the presence of a fragile X chromosome. Some argue that it’s always better to know the cause of the problem so that education specialized for that disorder can be prescribed. Others counter that attaching a specific biological cause to a learning disability stigmatizes a child and limits his or her opportunities. What is your evaluation of these arguments?</p>
