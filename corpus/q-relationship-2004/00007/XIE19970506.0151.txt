MANILA , May 6 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- One month after a successful tour to South Asia and the Middle East , Philippine President Fidel Ramos today embarked on a three-nation America trip to continue his long-pursued economic diplomacy thrust .
`` I am the Philippines ' No. 1 salesman , not No. 1 tourist , '' Ramos said at a press briefing one day before his departure , defending the economic diplomacy he has been pushing since taking office four and half years ago .
The current trip , which will take Ramos to the United States , Mexico and Panama , is expected to clinch nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars ' worth of trade and investments , according to Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista .
Accompanied by a large group of leading Filipino businessmen , Ramos is also expected to bring back 28 trade and economic cooperation agreements from the tour , the president 's second scale diplomatic activity this year .
Economic diplomacy has been widely viewed as a cornerstone of the Ramos administration 's overall strategy for economic development since it was launched by the administration in 1992 .
In 1992 when Ramos took over from former President Corazon Aquino , the Philippines was bogged down in economic chaos , with its economy growing by only 0.6 percent in 1991 .
Raging insurgency by the leftists and the Muslims in the late part of the era of former President Ferdinand Marcos and seven military coups during the Aquino term had frightened away most foreign investors .
To lure back foreign investors , Ramos has actively pressed ahead with his economic diplomacy abroad while implementing a series of reform measures to rejuvenate the ailing economy at home .
During the past years , Ramos has traveled to more than 30 countries in Asia , Europe , the Middle East and America to rebuild foreign investors ' confidence in the Philippines , whose domestic situation has been getting stable .
Ramos ' foreign trips have generated more than 20 billion dollars in foreign investment and created 450,000 to 500,000 jobs in the country , according to official statistics .
Ramos ' economic diplomacy reached its peak last November when leaders of the 18 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- members gathered in Subic , the northern Philippines , for an informal meeting .
During the APEC meeting , over 5 billion dollars ' worth of business deals , which covered at least 20 projects , were struck between Philippine companies and their counterparts from other APEC economies .
Meanwhile , the Ramos administration took the opportunity to showcase its booming economy and even projected an image of an `` economic tiger cub '' to foreign media .
After the meeting , at least six countries , including the United States , Australia and Canada , sent trade missions to the country to explore investment opportunities .
To ensure a sustained high economic growth rate , analysts here said , both Ramos and his successors will have to continue the current economic diplomacy in the future .
A report issued earlier by the Asian Development Bank predicted that the Philippines needs at least 28 billion dollars to finance its infrastructure development in the next five years , which is far beyond Manila 's own financial means .
Therefore , more foreign capital is needed to improve the country 's still backward infrastructure , especially in the southern Philippines whose economy had been battered by decades of Muslim separatist activities .
Peace returned to most parts of the southern Philippines after the government forged a peace deal with the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front last September , paving the way for developing the long-neglected region .
Meanwhile , the Philippines needs to tap more markets for its products to reduce its widening trade deficit , which economists warned will slow down the country 's robust economic growth .
To curb the swelling trade deficit and reduce the country 's dependence on the traditional markets of the United States and Japan , the Ramos government has planned to open up new markets in Europe , the Middle East , South Asia and Latin America .
For these purposes , Ramos still has to doggedly pursue his economic diplomacy during the remaining one year of his term of office .
