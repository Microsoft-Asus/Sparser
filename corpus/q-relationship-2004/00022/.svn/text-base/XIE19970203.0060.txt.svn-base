Many of the refugees looked pale but hearty , saying they are happy to be back .
`` We were languishing in Monrovia and usually got very little to eat .
We are prepared to be hungry in our own country , '' says a 45-year -old Salifu Bockarie .
`` We flew these refugees because they would have not been able to stand 36 hours of sea ordeal , '' said Akiwumi .
As many as 1,300 more Sierra Leonean refugees will arrive on Wednesday via three vessels provided by the Sierra Leone navy , said Akiwumi .
The wave of refugee return came after Sierran Leonean President Tejan Kabbah 's call on all Sierra Leonean refugees to return to rebuild the country .

There they will get food and then be sent by bus to their original living places , mainly in the south and east of the country .

Sierra Leone now has 120,000 refugees in Liberia , 250,000 in Guinea and 4,900 in the Gambia , according to UN data .
These refugees fled Sierra Leone during the 1992 civil war .
