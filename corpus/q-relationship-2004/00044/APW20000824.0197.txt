FREETOWN , Sierra Leone
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Sierra Leone 's rebels attacked U.N. and government soldiers along a strategic road leading to the international airport , injuring two peacekeepers , U.N. officials said Thursday .
Revolutionary United Front rebels attacked government troops late Wednesday at Kabatha Junction , about 80 miles north of the capital , Freetown , U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said .
The army repelled the attack with an undetermined number of casualties on both sides , she said .
Later the same night , the rebels attacked a U.N. post farther south along the road that links Lungi airport to the western town of Port Loko .
Two Nigerian U.N. peacekeepers were injured , said Befecadu , who was not aware of any rebel casualties .
`` The situation has now been brought under control , '' she said .
Since Sierra Leone 's civil war began in 1991 , the rebels have systematically killed and maimed tens of thousands of people in an attempt to gain control of the government and the country 's lucrative diamond-mining regions .
They have abandoned three peace treaties , the latest signed last July .
In a bid to restart the peace process , the government Wednesday released 171 rebels -- including four children -- imprisoned in Freetown and surrounding towns since the RUF reignited the conflict in May , said Moses Showers , deputy director of prisons .
The released rebels were all ex-combatants , but did not include members of the RUF leadership .
More could be released in the future .
Last week , the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to create a special court aimed at prosecuting rebel leaders in Sierra Leone for their crimes .
Foday Sankoh , the now-imprisoned founding leader and spiritual guide of the RUF , is expected to be one of the first people brought to trial .
At U.N. headquarters in New York , military officials from the nine countries contributing troops to the peacekeeping force said Wednesday that the international community must support the effort and help promote a political solution , a U.N. spokesman said .
Secretary - General Kofi Annan invited officers from from Bangladesh , Ghana , Guinea , India , Jordan , Kenya , Nigeria , Russia , and Zambia , to listen to their views on strengthening the U.N. mission .
At Wednesday 's meeting , U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said , the nine countries `` stressed the responsibility of the whole international community '' for assisting the force .
The officers also underscored the importance of the commitment by Sierra Leone 's government `` to do its utmost to stabilize the situation in the country , as well as to maintain political and military pressure on the RUF , '' Eckhard said .
