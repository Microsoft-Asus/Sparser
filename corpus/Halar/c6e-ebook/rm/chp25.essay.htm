How does his suggestion anticipate use of outgroups in modern cladistic analysis?</p>

									<a name="para92"></a><p class="BlockText">Some nucleotide changes during molecular evolution cause amino acid substitutions in the encoded protein (nonsynonymous changes), and others do not (synonymous changes). In a comparison of rodent and human genes, rodents were found to accumulate synonymous changes 2.0 times faster than humans, and nonsynonymous substitutions 1.3 times as fast. What factors could explain this difference? How do such data complicate the use of molecular clocks in absolute dating?</p>

									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">Experts estimate that human activities cause the extinction of hundreds of species every year. The natural rate of extinction is thought to be a few species per year. As we continue to alter the global environment, especially by cutting down tropical rain forests, the resulting extinction will probably rival that at the end of the Cretaceous period. Most biologists are alarmed at this prospect. What are some reasons for their concern? Consider that life has endured numerous mass extinctions and has always bounced back. How is the present mass extinction different from previous extinctions? Why? What might be some of the consequences for the surviving species?</p>
