ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Pakistan rejected as unwarranted Saturday an apparent warning from the United States that it could be branded a sponsor of terrorism .
The foreign ministry said although the Pakistani government may be sympathetic to a secessionist uprising in Indian -ruled Kashmir , it is firmly opposed to terrorism and does not aid religious organizations involved in the insurgency .
`` There is no warrant for any warning , '' the ministry said in a statement .
On Thursday , the United States warned Pakistan that it could be listed as a sponsor of terrorism -- making it ineligible for virtually all U.S. aid -- if it gave direct support to Harkat -ul- Mujahedeen , a militant group that operates in Kashmir and is headquartered in Pakistan .
The warning followed comments by U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin earlier in the week that there has long been concern that agencies of the Pakistani government provided `` general support '' to a number of groups operating in the territory disputed by India and Pakistan .
Washington says there are links between last month 's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane and Harkat -ul- Mujahedeen , which was placed on the State Department 's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat -ul- Ansar .
On Saturday , Pakistan 's foreign ministry repeated its condemnation of the hijacking and vowed to punish the hijackers if they are arrested in Pakistan .
The hijacking ended in Afghanistan with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the Indian government 's release of three pro- Kashmiri militants .
The most prominent of the militants is Maulana Masood Azhar , a Harkat -ul- Mujahedeen member who had been in jail in India since 1994 without being charged .
Since his release he has toured Pakistan making speeches condemning India and trying to recruit holy warriors to fight Indian troops in the part of Kashmir ruled by India .
The former princely state , tucked in the shadows of the Himalayan Mountains , is divided between Pakistan and India but both countries claim a united Kashmir as their own .
The neighbors have fought two wars over Kashmir and last summer engaged in a bitter border dispute .
`` In Pakistan there is legitimate sympathy with the Kashmir people , who are suffering Indian military occupation and sustained repression which has been widely documented by human rights organizations , '' said the Pakistani statement .
`` The legitimate Kashmiri struggle cannot be described as terrorist activity , '' it said .
`` However we believe in the peaceful negotiations process ... -LRB- and -RRB- official Pakistani agencies do not provide any support to the religious organizations '' involved in the insurgency .
According to the foreign ministry statement , these organizations are bound by Pakistani laws and `` infringement of the laws would entail required action . ''
Pakistan has been a close ally of the United States in the battle against terrorism , the statement says , offering as an example the extradition from Pakistan of suspects involved in the World Trade Center bombing in New York and the attack on U.S. Embassies in Africa .
`` Pakistan does not condone international tension , '' the statement said .
`` We have demonstrated our opposition to terrorism . ''
Meanwhile Saturday , rockets fired from across the border in India slammed into the Pakistani village of Daholo Wali , killing two people and wounding three others , said Shahid Mahmood , deputy commissioner of the Sialkot region .
Indian troops in the area have fired heavy mortars and waged regular gun battles across the border , he said .
Several other rockets have landed without exploding .
The attack came just one day after two bombs shook Karachi , killing four people and wounding 32 others .
Most of the dead and wounded in Karachi were worshippers at a mosque , which was heavily damaged by one of the bombs .
