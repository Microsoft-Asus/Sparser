These are relative terms that are meaningful only in a comparative sense. For example, tap water is hypertonic to distilled water but hypotonic to seawater.

Pores in this synthetic membrane are too small for sugar molecules to pass but large enough for water molecules to cross the membrane. In effect, the solution with higher solute concentration (hypertonic) has a lower water concentration. Therefore the water will diffuse across the membrane from the hypotonic solution to the hypertonic solution. This diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane is a special case of passive transport called <span class="Emphasis2">osmosis.</span><A href="javascript:popNote('8','1')"><SUP><B>*</B></SUP></A></p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig8-11','../fig/big/fig8-11.jpg','fig8-11');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig8-11.jpg" alt="fig8-11" name="myfig8-11"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 8-11.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Osmosis.</span> Two sugar solutions of different concentrations are separated by a porous membrane that is permeable to the solvent (water) but not to the solute (sugar).

Seawater, which has a great variety of solutes, will lose water to a very concentrated solution of a single sugar because the total solute concentration of the seawater is lower. If two solutions are isotonic, water moves across a membrane separating the solutions at an equal rate in both directions; that is, there is no net osmosis between isotonic solutions. (In Chapters 36 and 44, we will look at osmosis in a more quantitative way.)</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
