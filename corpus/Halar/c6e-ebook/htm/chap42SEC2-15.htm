This is a downward force equal to that exerted by a column of mercury 760 mm high. Since the atmosphere is 21%  oxygen (by volume), the partial pressure of oxygen (abbreviated P<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>) is 0.21 &#160;X&#160; 760, or about 160 mm Hg. This is the portion of atmospheric pressure contributed by oxygen; hence the term <span class="Emphasis1">partial pressure</span>. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<SUB>CO<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>) at sea level is only 0.23 mm Hg. When water is exposed to air, the amount of a gas that dissolves in the water is proportional to its partial pressure in the air and its solubility in water. An equilibrium is eventually reached when gas molecules enter and leave the solution at the same rate. At this point, the gas is said to have the same partial pressure in solution as it does in the air. Thus, in a glass of water exposed to air at sea-level air pressure, the P<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> is 160 mm Hg, and the P<SUB>CO<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> is 0.23 mm Hg.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">A gas will always diffuse from a region of higher partial pressure. Blood arriving at the lungs via the pulmonary arteries has a lower P<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> and a higher P<SUB>CO<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> than the air in the alveoli (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 42.27</span>). As blood enters the alveolar capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood to the air within the alveoli. Meanwhile, oxygen in the air dissolves in the fluid that coats the epithelium and diffuses across the surface and into the blood. By the time the blood leaves the lungs in the pulmonary veins, its P<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> has been raised and its P<SUB>CO<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> has been lowered. After returning to the heart, this blood is pumped through the systemic circuit. In the tissue capillaries, gradients of partial pressure favor the diffusion of oxygen out of the blood and carbon dioxide into the blood. This is because cellular respiration removes oxygen from and adds carbon dioxide to the interstitial fluid (again, by diffusion, from mitochondria in nearby cells). After the blood unloads oxygen and loads carbon dioxide, it is returned to the heart and pumped to the lungs again, where it exchanges gases with air in the alveoli.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig42-27','../fig/big/fig42-27.jpg','fig42-27');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig42-27.jpg" alt="fig42-27" name="myfig42-27"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 42-27.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Loading and unloading of respiratory gases.</span> The colored bars indicate the partial pressures of O<SUB>2</SUB> (P<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>) and CO<SUB>2</SUB> (P<SUB>CO<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>) (in mm Hg) in different locations.
