WHO confirms Iraq bird flu death
The World Health Organisation has confirmed that a teenage girl died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in northern Iraq last month.

Initial tests found the virus had not been the cause of Shanjin Abdel Qader's death, but tests carried out in a UK laboratory have now proved otherwise.

Specimens from the girl's 39-year-old uncle, who died last week, and a sick 54-year-old woman are now being tested.

The WHO has sent experts in infection control and epidemiology to the region.

But the team will not arrive in northern city of Sulaimaniya until early next week, because of the security situation.

"Health officials, with support from WHO staff, have set up an emergency operations room to respond to the outbreak, investigate rumours, and address public concerns," a statement posted on the WHO website said.

"Rumours of possible human cases in other parts of the country have been systematically followed up. To date, no such rumours have been substantiated."

The WHO said Iraq's first human case of the virus had occurred despite the absence of confirmed outbreaks of the disease in poultry.

Nevertheless, it said the culling of domestic birds in northern Iraq was already underway and that large numbers of birds had already been destroyed.

The affected region borders Turkey, where bird flu has been found in poultry and four people have died of the virus.
