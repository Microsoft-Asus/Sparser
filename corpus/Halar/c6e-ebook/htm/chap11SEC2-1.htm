Researchers have learned that cells of this yeast identify their mates by chemical signaling (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.1</span>). There are two sexes, or mating types, called <span class="Emphasis2">a</span> and <span class="symbol">a</span>. Cells of mating type <span class="Emphasis2">a</span> secrete a chemical signal called <span class="Emphasis2">a</span> factor, which can bind to specific receptor proteins on nearby <span class="symbol">a</span> cells. At the same time, <span class="symbol">a</span> cells secrete <span class="symbol">a</span> factor, which binds to receptors on <span class="Emphasis2">a</span> cells. Without actually entering the cells, the receptor-bound molecules of the two mating factors cause the cells to grow toward each other and bring about other cellular changes. The result is the fusion, or mating, of two cells of opposite type. The new <span class="Emphasis2">a</span>/<span class="symbol">a</span> cell contains all the genes of both original cells, a combination of genetic resources that provides advantages to this cell’s descendants.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig11-1','../fig/big/fig11-1.jpg','fig11-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig11-1.jpg" alt="fig11-1" name="myfig11-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 11-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Communication between mating yeast cells</span>. Cells of the yeast <span class="Emphasis1">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> use chemical signaling to identify cells of opposite mating type and initiate the mating process.

The process by which a signal on a cell’s surface is converted into a specific cellular response is a series of steps called a <span class="Emphasis2">signal-transduction pathway.</span> Many such pathways have been extensively studied in both yeast and animal cells. Amazingly, the molecular details of signal transduction in yeast and mammals are strikingly similar, even though the last common ancestor of these two groups of organisms lived over a billion years ago. These similarities--and others recently uncovered between signaling systems in bacteria and plants--suggest that early versions of the cell-signaling mechanisms used today evolved well before the first multicellular creatures appeared on Earth. Scientists think that signaling mechanisms evolved first in ancient prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes and were then adopted for new uses by their multicellular descendants. Meanwhile, cell signaling has remained important in the microbial world. <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 11.2</span> shows an example in a sophisticated modern bacterium.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig11-2','../fig/big/fig11-2.jpg','fig11-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig11-2.jpg" alt="fig11-2" name="myfig11-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 11-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Communication among bacteria.</span> Soil-dwelling bacteria called myxobacteria ("slime bacteria") use chemical signaling to share information about nutrient availability. When food is scarce, starving cells secrete a molecule that enters neighboring cells and stimulates them to aggregate. The cells form a structure that produces thick-walled spores capable of surviving until the environment improves.
