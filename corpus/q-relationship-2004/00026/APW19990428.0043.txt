-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Russia 's main space agency is skeptical about an alleged deal in which a British businessman has reportedly agreed to pay $ 100 million to fly on the Mir space station .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Russia 's space industry has been desperately trying to find private funding for the 13-year -old orbiting space station , or else the station will probably have to be abandoned around August .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The RKK Energia corporation , which runs the Mir , claimed Tuesday that businessman Peter Llewelyn had agreed to invest at least $ 100 million to finance the Mir 's operations .
In return , he would get to fly to the Mir for one week in August , according to Energia spokesman Sergei Gromov .
In Tel Aviv , Llewelyn said Tuesday he was not paying to go on Mir .
He claimed his trip would be part of a fund-raising effort for a 2,000-bed children 's hospital he plans to build in Karalauf , 25 miles outside of Moscow .</ENAMEX>
`` This report is totally incorrect , '' he told The Associated Press .
`` The shuttle is going up to pick up astronauts and I 'm just hitching a ride . ''
`` People are going to sponsor me so much money per mile in space , '' he said .
`` The money raised will be used for the hospital and nothing else . ''
Llewelyn said two years ago his son was born with a heart problem .
`` A surgeon saved my son 's life .
I made a promise that I would build a hospital , '' he said .
Sergei Gorbunov , a spokesman for the Russian Space Agency , said the Energia announcement was premature because the deal was far from final .
`` All of us will be very happy if they find an enthusiast eager to finance the Mir , but I think it 's too early yet to celebrate , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Gromov noted that several previous negotiations with other would-be financiers had broken down </ENAMEX>.
It was not clear if Llewelyn even had the money .
Two years ago , Llewelyn faced five counts of theft for allegedly swindling $ 38,000 from a business partner in Pittsburgh , Pa .
He paid the money back and the case was dropped .
