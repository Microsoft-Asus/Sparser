Astonishing is the word for the warm and tumultuous welcome South Korean President Kim Dae -jung received in Pyongyang this week from thousands of cheering North Koreans and their Communist overlord Kim Jong Il .
It was as if everyone involved decided not to let harsh realities -- such as the explosive border the Koreas share and half a century of near-war -- get in the way of a joyous family get-together .
Of course , nothing happens in North Korea without the Dear Leader 's say-so .
Kim Jong Il ca n't be terribly confident about his regime 's prospects for survival , what with his nation on the verge of economic collapse , even starvation .
So he deigned to play the jolly fat man , making jokes about his reputation as eccentric loner and extending a hand of friendship to his southern counterpart .
What the two Kims agreed upon is vague but promising .
An obvious priority is to arrange visits promptly between Korean families too long separated .
That would be facilitated by reopening cross-border rail lines and roads , which would have the further benefit of encouraging trade and much-needed investment in the North .
Reducing hair-trigger tensions on both sides of the demilitarized zone dividing the peninsula is another must .
As for reuniting the two Koreas into one nation , 70 million strong , that is a far more serious challenge than the consolidation of East and West Germany and could take generations .
Of course , America has a substantial stake in all this , most notably in the form of the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea .
They were n't even mentioned in the Kim - Kim dialogue , nor was there any need to .
A U.S. presence will be required for the duration , until signs of a durable peace on the peninsula are unmistakable .
The United States should move quickly , however , to discourage North Korean arms adventurism .
Last September , Washington and Pyongyang agreed that North Korea would halt missile testing in return for the phasing-out of a decades-long U.S. economic embargo .
So far , North Korea has stuck to the deal , but the United States has failed to deliver .
It 's hard to fathom why the Clinton administration and Congress seem hellbent on building a national missile defense , principally to defend against North Korea , when whatever puny threat Pyongyang poses could be negated by other , peaceable means .
As a sign of its good faith and in recognition of this week 's fruitful all- Korea summit , the Clinton administration should start soon to relax U.S. sanctions against North Korea .
