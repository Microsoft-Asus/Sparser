The Algerian arrested two weeks ago after he ran from U.S. Customs inspectors -- and a rental car loaded with explosives -- belongs to a notorious terrorist group blamed for massacres , bombings and a hijacking , federal prosecutors now assert .
For the first time , prosecutors have linked Ahmed Ressam , who remains in a federal detention center south of Seattle , with a Canadian woman arrested after she tried to cross the border at a remote port of entry in Vermont .
Meanwhile , there were also media reports Thursday that a federal judge in Seattle had issued an arrest warrant for a material witness in the Ressam case .
FBI agents and federal prosecutors would not discuss the warrant , which has reportedly been sealed .
In Canada , law enforcement officials have issued a warrant and are searching for Abdelmajed Dahoumane , whom officials believe shared a motel room with Ressam before he left for Washington state .
Prosecutors have been downplaying links between Ressam 's arrest and later arrests at the Canada - U.S. border in Vermont -- until Thursday .
Lucia Garofalo had an Algerian man with her when she was arrested Dec. 19 -- five days after customs inspectors tackled and apprehended a fleeing Ressam in Port Angeles .
He had just arrived on a ferry from Victoria , British Columbia .
The link between them is a former roommate of Ressam 's in Montreal , said Charles Tetzlaff , U.S. attorney in Vermont .
Prosecutors contend that the roommate , Said Atmani , was a forger for an Algerian terrorist organization known as the Armed Islamic Group , and that he helped pay for a trip Garofalo made to Europe .
But Tetzlaff said prosecutors were not prepared to say that Ressam and Garofalo had worked together to launch a terrorist attack .
`` The evidence is that Mr. Atmani is a member of an Algerian extremist organization .
She had contact with Mr. Atmani , and we know Mr. Atmani was a roommate of Mr. Ressam , '' Tetzlaff said .
Court documents , however , suggest the link was stronger than a common acquaintance .
`` In light of ... the fact that her crimes occurred contemporaneously with Ressam 's attempt to smuggle explosives into the United States , it is likely that her actions were taken on behalf of an Algerian terrorist organization or organizations , '' federal prosecutors argued in the documents , filed in the Vermont case .
`` ... Because of the remarkable coincidence of the dates and nexus with Montreal , it is similarly likely that her actions were in some way connected to the actions of Ressam . ''
In court Thursday , an assistant U.S. attorney accused Garofalo of `` working to assist terrorist organizations . ''
Federal prosecutors in Seattle have not publicly linked Ressam to any terrorist organizations , including the Armed Islamic Group , which is known by its French acronym GIA .
The explosives found in Ressam 's car have been sufficient to persuade a federal magistrate to order him held without bail in a dentention center in SeaTac .
He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of smuggling bomb-making components and lying to inspectors .
But prosecutors in Vermont lack such physical evidence as explosives , so they used intelligence provided by a foreign government to allege terrorist connections .
They argued that `` the possiblity -- indeed the probability -- exists that further information will come to light which will tie her activities even more directly to those of Ressam .
As such , there is a substantial risk that the organization that supported Ressam 's activities will have every incentive to aid her flight from the United States . ''
U.S. Magistrate Jerome Neidermeier agreed to have Garofalo , who faces immigration charges , held without bail .
`` There are enough factors in this to indicate something beyond a plan to enter someone into in the United States , '' he concluded .
Prosecutors described Garofalo , 35 , as a mother of three who has $ 8 in her checking account and lives on welfare in Montreal .
Yet she travels extensively , including to the U.S. , European counties , Morocco and Libya , and carries a cellular phone .
She tried to bring Algerians into the United States through New England three times in December .
She was finally arrested trying to cross the border with an Algerian -- Bouabide Chamachi , who is also being held without bail .
Her husband is also an Algerian , who has been unsuccessful in trying to enter Canada from Germany .
The foreign government told U.S. officials that Garofalo contacted Atmani in September 1997 to finance her airline ticket to Germany and to hire a lawyer for her husband , according to the court documents .
Atmani agreed to meet her on a Montreal street corner and gave her $ 700 , authorities said .
His name has surfaced repeatedly since Ressam 's arrest .
French authorities are interested in questioning him about a terrorist bombing of the Paris subway in 1995 .
They also reported that Ressam belonged to a cell of the GIA , according to court documents .
The GIA is extreme even for terrorist groups .
It has massacred entire villages of men , women and children and declared women who do not wear traditional Muslim veils fit targets for assassination .
It 's actions are so bloody that even other terrorist groups have condemned it .
The GIA has been blamed for a 1994 hijacking in which terrorists planned to blow up an Air France jet over Paris .
Instead , French commandos stormed the jet and killed the terrorists .
The GIA also has been blamed for bombings in France .
But until now , its efforts have been limited to Algeria and France , which supports the current Algerian government .
Montreal police say Algerian terrorists do operate in that city , using extortion and thefts to fund overseas activities .
Vincent Cannistraro , a former counterterrorism chief at the CIA , said he doubts the GIA is planning an attack on the United States .
`` Is this a new thing ?
A GIA operation nipped in the bud ?
That does n't seem likely that the GIA would change its agenda , '' he said .
`` It 's not a GIA operation .
I 'm persuaded that this is an Osama bin Laden operation , '' he said .
Bin Laden , the Saudi -born terrorist , is blamed for bombing two American embassies in Africa last year .
Some members of the GIA are thought to have fought and perhaps trained in Afghanistan , which is bin Laden 's base of operations .
The information prosecutors released Thursday , along with the FBI 's launching of a nationwide effort to question and possibly arrest those who know Ressam , underscores that there is an infastructure of a terrorist group in the U.S. , Cannistraro said .
Another former intelligence official said it 's quite possible that Ressam and Garofalo know little about each other 's activities .
`` They may or may not know anyone , '' said David Harris , former chief of strategic planning for Canadian Security Intelligence Service .
`` Security calls for and enforces that .
In a way , it 's more tricky than it appears to identify a connection . ''
Tetzlaff would not identify the foreign government that provided information to prosecutors .
But Cannistraro said the government is almost certainly Canada , whose law enforcement officials have been working closely with their U.S. counterparts in the Ressam case .
In Seattle , FBI agents and prosecutors would say little beyond what was revealed in Vermont .
`` That 's information that 's going to have to stand on its own , '' said Robbie Burroughs , spokeswoman for the FBI in Seattle .
Katrina Pflaumer , U.S. attorney for Western Washington , would not say whether the information in court documents will prompt additional charges against Ressam , including conspiracy .
`` We never speculate about charges , '' she said .
