LAGOS , September 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Nigerian military leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar has appealed to the international community to lift sanctions against his country as demonstration of its support for the on-going democratization process .
Abubakar made the call Thursday in New York when he addressed the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly .
In his address , Abubakar reiterated his government 's commitment to handing over power to a democratically elected civilian administration on May 29 , 1999 .
He said the current changes in the country could best be described as a `` silent but peaceful revolution '' and called on Nigerians still on self-exile to return and join the democratization process .
Abubakar stressed his government 's commitment to respect for human rights , adding that the government 's promise on de-congestion of prisons was in line with its avowed commitment in that regard .
Nigeria was sanctioned by the West after the annulment of the June 12 , 1993 presidential election .
Further sanctions were imposed in 1995 for executing author Ken Saro - Wiwa and eight other minority activists .
Its relations with the West , however , has improved since Abubakar took office in June , as the new leader has since taken drastic measures in promoting reconciliation , human rights and a new transition to civil rule program .
In his speech , the general also condemned terrorism around the world , especially the recent bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , and called for collective efforts to stamp out the menace .
Abubakar called for the accelerated reforms of the U.N. Security Council , saying that the democratization of the U.N. was necessary to engender loyalty and commitment by members .
