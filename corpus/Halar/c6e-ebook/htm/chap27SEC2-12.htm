Ongoing life depends on the recycling of chemical elements between the biological and physical components of ecosystems. Prokaryotes play essential roles in these chemical cycles (to be discussed in detail in Chapter 54). If it were not for such <span class="Emphasis2">decomposers,</span> carbon, nitrogen, and other elements essential to life would become locked in the organic molecules of corpses and waste products.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Prokaryotes also mediate the return of elements from the nonliving components of the environment (air, inorganic soil, and water) to the pool of organic compounds. Autotrophic prokaryotes make organic compounds from CO<SUB>2</SUB>, supporting food chains through which organic nutrients pass from the prokaryotes to prokaryote eaters, then on to secondary consumers.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Because of their many unique metabolic capabilities, prokaryotes are the only organisms able to metabolize inorganic molecules containing elements such as iron, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Cyanobacteria not only synthesize food and restore oxygen to the atmosphere, but also fix nitrogen, stocking the soil and water with nitrogenous compounds that other organisms can use to make proteins. And when plants and the animals that eat them die, soil prokaryotes return the nitrogen to the atmosphere. All life on Earth depends on prokaryotes and their unparalleled metabolic diversity.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
