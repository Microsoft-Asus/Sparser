NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
India on Monday denied Pakistani allegations that it had plans for another nuclear test in this already volatile region .
Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was `` surprising '' -- and wrong .
`` India has declared a moratorium on testing , and this has been reiterated by the prime minister himself , '' Singh said .
On Sunday , the Indian foreign ministry reaffirmed New Delhi 's willingness to adhere to a voluntary moratorium on further tests and its offer of a no-first-strike pact with Islamabad .
The ministry , in a statement , also urged all nuclear weapon states to open early negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention .
India was the first to escalate the long-standing Indo - Pakistan rivalry to the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13 .
In response , Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week .
`` I have credible information that they -LRB- the Indians -RRB- are already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast somewhere in the first or second week in July , '' Khan told CNN Sunday .
Pakistan has not said whether it would test again .
U.S. intelligence sources said over the weekend they had detected no signs that either Pakistan or India was readying new tests .
The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved from the same British colony 50 years ago .
They are divided by religion -- Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately Hindu -- and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir , which is divided between them and claimed in its entirety by both countries .
Indian -held Kashmir is the only Muslim -majority state in the country .
Violence broke out Monday in Srinagar , the capital of Indian -held Kashmir , after about 100 people who oppose Indian rule distributed sweets in the streets -- a traditional way of celebrating -- and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its nuclear tests .
Some of the protesters threw stones at police , who responded by beating the protesters .
The crowd dispersed after half an hour .
Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups fighting either for Kashmir 's independence or its union with Pakistan .
Pakistan says it lends them only moral support .
