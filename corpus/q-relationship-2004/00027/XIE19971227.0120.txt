COLOMBO , December 27 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Sri Lankan medical experts have warned the locals to be cautious of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- agent that causes the `` mad cow '' disease , the official newspaper Daily News said Saturday .
The warning was issued in the wake of reports that said beef products from Britain had been distributed free to the locals who bought a Sunday newspaper recently .
Professor Tissa Vitarana , an official of the Ministry of Science , Technology and Human Resources Development , said the Healthy Ministry should initiate investigations to find out whether the free beef products distributed with the newspaper were contaminated with the `` mad cow '' disease .
The Sri Lankan government has banned the import of beef products from Britain in June in order to keep the fatal `` mad cow '' disease , which was first found in Britain , out of the country .
Most countries in the world have banned imports of British beef products to prevent the disease from spreading to their lands .
The Daily News said that medical experts here also urged the government to raise public awareness of the disease by launching a nationwide education program .
