PHNOM PENH , Cambodia
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Three ethnic Vietnamese have been killed in an attack on a fishing village in what police said Thursday marked the first murders targeting the minority group during an election campaign filled with vitriol against them .
The Vietnamese and another person were killed Wednesday night when five unidentified gunmen burst into their home in the eastern province of Kratie and opened fire with automatic weapons , officials said .
The family had lived in Cambodia since 1980 .
`` It was a terrorist act , because nothing was stolen after that , '' said Mao Chandara , a senior Interior Ministry police official .
`` I think it marks the harassment of the Vietnamese before the elections . ''
The attackers fled on a boat .
An investigation was under way in order to curb violence in the run-up to voting July 26 .
Election authorities had been informed of the attack .
An estimated 200,000 to 1 million ethnic Vietnamese live in Cambodia , a nation of about 10 million people .
Many Cambodians harbor a deep distrust of Vietnam , which has swallowed up large tracts of Cambodian territory over the centuries .
The major opposition candidates in the elections have played up anti- Vietnamese rhetoric , saying the country risks being overrun by illegal immigrants and accusing Vietnam of designs on Cambodia .
Cambodian leader Hun Sen is often accused by his opponents of being a tool of Vietnam .
He came to power during the 1980s , when the country was under harsh Vietnamese military occupation .
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1979 and toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime , but many Cambodians feared Hanoi intended to swallow their country .
The Khmer Rouge , now all but extinct , survived for years as a guerrilla army billing itself as Cambodia 's defender against Vietnam .
The group massacred scores of ethnic Vietnamese ahead of U.N. -sponsored elections in 1993 .
Khmer Rouge raiders attacked a Vietnamese fishing village in April , killing 21 people .
