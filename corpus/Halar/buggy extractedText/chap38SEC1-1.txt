SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

 

 Sporophyte and gametophyte generations alternate in the life cycles of plants: a review



 

 Flowers are specialized shoots bearing the reproductive organs of the angiosperm sporophyte



 

 Male and female gametophytes develop within anthers and ovaries, respectively: Pollination brings them together



 

 Plants have various mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization



 

 Double fertilization gives rise to the zygote and endosperm



 

 The ovule develops into a seed containing an embryo and a supply of nutrients



 

 The ovary develops into a fruit adapted for seed dispersal



 

 Evolutionary adaptations of seed germination contribute to seedling survival
