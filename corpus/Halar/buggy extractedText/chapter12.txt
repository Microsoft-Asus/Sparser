The ability of organisms to reproduce their kind is the one characteristic that best distinguishes living things from nonliving matter. This unique capacity to procreate, like all biological functions, has a cellular basis. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, put it this way in 1855: "Where a cell exists, there must have been a preexisting cell, just as the animal arises only from an animal and the plant only from a plant." He summarized with the Latin axiom,"Omnis cellula e cellula,"meaning "Every cell from a cell." The continuity of life is based on the reproduction of cells, or cell division. The series of images in the micrograph on this page follows an animal cell's chromosomes through one round of cell division, starting at the lower left.

In this chapter, you will learn how cells reproduce to form genetically equivalent daughter cells.*This division process is an integral part of the cell cycle, the life of a cell from its origin in the division of a parent cell until its own division into two.

 Cancer cells have escaped from cell cycle controls



The timing and rate of cell division in different parts of a plant or animal are crucial to normal growth, development, and maintenance. The frequency of cell division varies with the type of cell. For example, human skin cells divide frequently throughout life, whereas liver cells maintain the ability to divide but keep it in reserve until an appropriate need arises--say, to repair a wound. Some of the most specialized cells, such as mature nerve cells and muscle cells, do not divide at all in a mature human. These cell cycle differences result from regulation at the molecular level. The mechanisms of this regulation are of intense interest, not only for understanding the life cycles of normal cells but also for understanding how cancer cells manage to escape normal controls.





 Cell division functions in reproduction, growth, and repair

When a unicellular organism such as Amoeba divides to form duplicate offspring, the division of one cell reproduces an entire organism (FIGURE 12.1a, p. 216), and cell division on a larger scale can produce progeny from some multicellular organisms (such as plants that grow from cuttings). But cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from a single cell--the fertilized egg, or zygote (FIGURE 12.1b). And after an organism is fully grown, cell division continues to function in renewal and repair, replacing cells that die from normal wear and tear or accidents. For example, dividing cells in your bone marrow continuously make new blood cells (FIGURE 12.1c).

Fig 12-1. 12.1 The functions of cell division (all LMs).

The reproduction of an ensemble as complex as a cell cannot occur by a mere pinching in half; the cell is not like a soap bubble that simply enlarges and splits in two. Cell division involves the distribution of identical genetic material--DNA--to two daughter cells. What is most remarkable about cell division is the fidelity with which the DNA is passed along, without dilution, from one generation of cells to the next. A dividing cell duplicates its DNA, allocates the two copies to opposite ends of the cell, and only then splits into daughter cells.





 Cell division distributes identical sets of chromosomes to daughter cells

A cell's endowment of DNA, its genetic information, is called its genome. Although a prokaryotic genome is often a single long DNA molecule, eukaryotic genomes usually consist of a number of DNA molecules. The overall length of DNA in a eukaryotic cell is enormous. A typical human cell, for example, has about 3 m of DNA--a length about 300,000 times greater than the cell's diameter. Yet before the cell can divide, all of this DNA must be copied and then the two copies separated so that each daughter cell ends up with a complete genome.

The replication and distribution of so much DNA is manageable because the DNA molecules are packaged into chromosomes, so named because they take up certain dyes used in microscopy (chromo, colored, and somes, bodies) (FIGURE 12.2). Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. For example, the nuclei of human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes. Reproductive cells, or gametes--sperm cells and egg cells--have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or 23 chromosomes in humans.

Fig 12-2. Eukaryotic chromosomes. A tangle of chromosomes (stained orange) is visible within the nucleus of this kangaroo rat epithelial cell. The cell is preparing to divide (LM).

Incorporated into each eukaryotic chromosome is one very long, linear DNA molecule representing hundreds or thousands of genes, the units that specify an organism's inherited traits. The DNA is associated with various proteins that maintain the structure of the chromosome and help control the activity of the genes. This DNA-protein complex, called chromatin, is organized into a long, thin fiber. After a cell duplicates its DNA in preparation for division, the chromatin condenses: It becomes densely coiled and folded, making the chromosomes much shorter and so thick that we can see them with a light microscope.

Each duplicated chromosome has two sister chromatids. The two chromatids, containing identical copies of the chromosome's DNA molecule, are initially attached by proteins all along their lengths. In its condensed form, the chromosome has a narrow "waist" at a specialized region called the centromere (FIGURE 12.3). Later in the cell division process, the sister chromatids of all the chromosomes are pulled apart and repackaged as complete chromosome sets in two new nuclei, one at each end of the cell. Mitosis, the division of the nucleus, is usually followed immediately by cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. Where there was one cell, there are now two, each the genetic equivalent of the parent cell.

Fig 12-3. Chromosome duplication and distribution during mitosis. A eukaryotic cell preparing to divide duplicates each of its multiple chromosomes, one of which is represented here. A duplicated chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which narrow at their centromeres. The micrograph shows a human chromosome in this state (SEM). Each chromatid consists of one very long chromatin fiber folded and coiled in a compact arrangement. The DNA molecules of the sister chromatids are identical. As mitosis continues, mechanical processes separate the sister chromatids and distribute them to two daughter cells. Chromosomes normally exist in the highly condensed state here only during the process of mitosis.

What happens to chromosome number as we follow the human life cycle through the generations? You inherited 46 chromosomes, one set of 23 from each parent. They were combined in the nucleus of a single cell when a sperm cell from your father united with an egg cell from your mother to form a fertilized egg, or zygote. Mitosis and cytokinesis produced the trillions of somatic cells that now make up your body, and the same processes continue to generate new cells to replace dead and damaged ones. In contrast, you produce gametes--eggs or sperm cells--by a variation of cell division called meiosis, which yields daughter cells that have half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis occurs only in your gonads (ovaries or testes). In each generation of humans, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from 46 to 23. Fertilization fuses two gametes together and doubles the chromosome number to 46 again, and mitosis conserves that number in every somatic cell nucleus of the new individual. In Chapter 13, we will examine the role of meiosis in reproduction and inheritance in more detail. In the remainder of this chapter, we focus on mitosis and the rest of the mitotic cell cycle.





 The mitotic phase alternates with interphase in the cell cycle: an overview

Mitosis is just one part of the cell cycle (FIGURE 12.4). In fact, the mitotic (M) phase, which includes both mitosis and cytokinesis, is usually the shortest part of the cell cycle. Mitotic cell division alternates with a much longer interphase, which often accounts for about 90%  of the cycle. It is during interphase that the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Interphase can be divided into subphases: the G1phase ("first gap"), the S phase, and the G2phase ("second gap"). During all three subphases, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase (S stands for synthesis of DNA). Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it copies its chromosomes (S), grows more as it completes preparations for cell division (G2), and divides (M). The daughter cells may then repeat the cycle.

Fig 12-4. The cell cycle. In a dividing cell, the mitotic (M) phase alternates with interphase, a growth period. The first part of interphase, called G1, is followed by the S phase, when the chromosomes replicate; the last part of interphase is called G2. In the M phase, mitosis divides the nucleus and distributes its chromosomes to the daughter nuclei, and cytokinessis divides the cytoplasm, producing two daughter cells.

Time-lapse films of living, dividing cells reveal the dynamics of mitosis as a continuum of changes. For purposes of description, however, mitosis is conventionally broken down into five subphases: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. FIGURE 12.5, on pages 218-219, describes these stages in an animal cell. Be sure to study this figure thoroughly before progressing to the next section, which examines mitosis more closely.

The chromosomes appear blue and the microtubules green. (The red fibers are intermediate filaments.) The schematic drawings show details not visible in the micrographs. For the sake of simplicity, only four chromosomes are drawn. (In plant cells, centrioles are lacking and cytokinesis occurs differently.





 The mitotic spindle distributes chromosomes to daughter cells: a closer look

Many of the events of mitosis depend on the mitotic spindle, which begins to form in the cytoplasm during prophase. This structure consists of fibers made of microtubules and associated proteins. While the mitotic spindle assembles, the microtubules of the cytoskeleton partially disassemble, probably providing the material used to construct the spindle. The spindle microtubules elongate by incorporating more subunits of the protein tubulin (see TABLE 7.2).

The assembly of spindle microtubules starts in the centrosome, a nonmembranous organelle that functions throughout the cell cycle to organize the cell's microtubules (it is also called the microtubule-organizing center). In animal cells, a pair of centrioles is located at the center of the centrosome, but the centrioles are not essential for cell division. In fact, the centrosomes of most plants lack centrioles, and if a researcher destroys the centrioles of an animal cell with a laser micro beam, a spindle nevertheless forms during mitosis.

During interphase, the single centrosome replicates to form two centrosomes (see FIGURE 12.5). As mitosis starts, the two centrosomes are located near the nucleus; they then move apart from each other during prophase and prometaphase, as spindle microtubules grow out from them. By the end of prometaphase, the two centrosomes, referred to as spindle poles in this context, are at opposite poles of the cell.

Each of the two joined chromatids of a chromosome has a kinetochore, a structure of proteins and specific sections of chromosomal DNA at the centromere. The chromosome's two kinetochores face in opposite directions. During prometaphase, some of the spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores. When one of a chromosome's kinetochores is "captured" by microtubules, the chromosome begins to move toward the pole from which those microtubules come. However, this movement is checked as soon as microtubules from the opposite pole attach to the other kinetochore. What happens next is like a tug-of-war that ends in a draw. The chromosome moves first in one direction, then the other, back and forth, finally settling midway between the two poles of the cell (FIGURE 12.6). Meanwhile, microtubules that do not attach to kinetochores interact with nonkinetochore microtubules from the opposite pole of the cell. At metaphase, these microtubules overlap, and the centromeres of all the duplicated chromosomes are on a plane midway between the two poles. This plane is called the metaphase plate of the cell. The spindle is now complete.

Fig 12-6. The mitotic spindle at metaphase.

Let's now see how the structure of the completed spindle correlates with its function during anaphase. Anaphase commences suddenly when proteins holding together the sister chromatids of each chromosome are inactivated. Now that the chromatids are separate, full-fledged chromosomes, they move toward opposite poles of the cell. How do the kinetochore microtubules function in this poleward movement of chromosomes? Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that kinetochores are equipped with motor proteins that "walk" a chromosome along the attached microtubules toward the nearest pole. Meanwhile, the microtubules shorten by depolymerizing at their kinetochore ends (FIGURE 12.7). (To review how motor proteins move an object along a microtubule, see FIGURE 7.21b.)

Fig 12-7. Testing a hypothesis for chromosome migration during anaphase.

What is the function of the nonkinetochore microtubules? In a dividing animal cell, these microtubules are responsible for elongating the whole cell during anaphase (see FIGURE 12.5). Nonkinetochore microtubules interdigitate across the metaphase plate, and during anaphase ones originating from opposite spindle poles move past each other toward their poles. The mechanism seems to be similar to the one that slides neighboring microtubules in a flagellum: Motor proteins attached to the nonkinetochore microtubules drive them past one another, using energy from ATP (see FIGURE 7.21a). At the same time, the nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen by the addition of tubulin subunits to their ends.

At the end of anaphase, duplicate sets of chromosomes have arrived at opposite poles of the elongated parent cell. Nuclei re-form during telophase. Cytokinesis generally begins during this last stage of mitosis.





 Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm: a closer look

In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by a process known as cleavage. The first sign of cleavage is the appearance of a cleavage furrow, which begins as a shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate (FIGURE 12.8a). On the cytoplasmic side of the furrow is a contractile ring of actin microfilaments associated with molecules of the protein myosin. Actin and myosin are the same proteins responsible for muscle contraction, as well as many other kinds of cell movement. The contraction of the dividing cell's ring of microfilaments is like the pulling of drawstrings. The cleavage furrow deepens until the parent cell is pinched in two, producing two completely separated cells.

Fig 12-8. Cytokinesis in animal and plant cells.

Cytokinesis in plant cells, which have walls, is markedly different. There is no cleavage furrow. Instead, during telophase, vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cell, where they coalesce, producing a cell plate (FIGURE 12.8b). Cell wall materials carried in the vesicles collect in the cell plate as it grows. The cell plate enlarges until its surrounding membrane fuses with the plasma membrane along the perimeter of the cell. Two daughter cells result, each with its own plasma membrane. Meanwhile, a new cell wall arising from the contents of the cell plate has formed between the daughter cells.

FIGURE 12.9 is a series of micrographs of a dividing plant cell. Examining this figure will help you review mitosis and cytokinesis.

 Mitosis in eukaryotes may have evolved from binary fission in bacteria

The complex cellular choreography of mitotic cell division solves the problem of correctly distributing copies of eukaryotic genomes to daughter cells. How did mitosis evolve? Given that prokaryotes preceded eukaryotes on Earth by billions of years, we might hypothesize that mitosis had its origins in simpler bacterial mechanisms of cell reproduction.

Prokaryotes (bacteria) reproduce by a type of cell division called binary fission, meaning literally "division in half." Most bacterial genes are carried on a single bacterial chromosome that consists of a circular DNA molecule and associated proteins. Although bacteria are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells, the problem of replicating their genomes in an orderly fashion and distributing the copies equally to two daughter cells is still formidable. The chromosome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, for example, when it is fully stretched out, is about 500 times longer than the length of the cell. Clearly, such a long chromosome must be highly coiled and folded within the cell--and it is.

Prokaryotes do not have mitotic spindles, so what brings about the separation of the two daughter chromosomes in a dividing bacterial cell? A hypothesis proposed in the 1960s suggested that separation of bacterial chromosomes results simply from the growth of new plasma membrane between two sites on the membrane where the chromosome copies are attached. Recent research, however, has challenged this model (FIGURE 12.10, p. 224). Rather than being a passive process, separation of daughter bacterial chromosomes involves active chromosomal movement. Once the DNA of the chromosome begins to replicate, the copies of the first replicated region--called the origin of replication--move apart rapidly. Using the techniques of modern DNA technology to tag the origins of replication with molecules that glow green in fluorescence microscopy (see TABLE 7.1), researchers have directly observed the movement of bacterial chromosomes. This movement is reminiscent of the poleward movements of the centromere regions of eukaryotic chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis, even though bacteria don't have mitotic spindles or even microtubules. How bacterial chromosomes move is still a mystery. The idea that prokaryotes might have molecules in any way like the microtubules and motor proteins used in eukaryotic mitosis is surprising and intriguing.

Fig 12-10. Bacterial cell division (binary fission). The single, circular bacterial chromosome replicates, and the two copies move apart by an unknown mechanism. Meanwhile, the cell grows in size. When chromosomal replication is complete, the plasma membrane grows inward to divide the cell in two as a new cell wall is deposited between the daughter cells. The example shown here is the bacterium Escherichia coli.

While the bacterial chromosome is replicating, the cell is growing. When replication is complete and the bacterium has reached about twice its initial size, its plasma membrane grows inward, dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells. Each cell inherits a complete genome.

As eukaryotes evolved, along with their larger genomes and nuclear envelopes, the ancestral process of binary fission somehow gave rise to mitosis. FIGURE 12.11 traces a hypothesis for the stepwise evolution of mitosis. Possible intermediate stages are represented by two unusual types of nuclear division found in certain modern unicellular algae. In both types, the nuclear envelope remains intact. In dinoflagellates, replicated chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope and separate as it elongates prior to cell division. In diatoms, a spindle within the nucleus separates the chromosomes.

Fig 12-11. A hypothesis for the evolution of mitosis. Researchers interested in the evolution of eukaryotic cell division have observed in modern organisms what they believe are mechanisms of division intermediate between the binary fission of bacteria and mitosis as it occurs in most eukaryotes. These schematic diagrams of a proposed evolutionary sequence do not show cell walls.





 A molecular control system drives the cell cycle

What drives the cell cycle? One reasonable hypothesis might be that each event in the cycle triggers the next. According to this hypothesis, for example, the replication of chromosomes in the S phase might cause cell growth during G2, which might in turn directly trigger the onset of mitosis. However, this apparently logical hypothesis is not in fact correct.

In the early 1970s, a variety of experiments suggested an alternative hypothesis: that the cell cycle is driven by specific chemical signals present in the cytoplasm. Some of the first strong evidence for this hypothesis came from experiments with mammalian cells grown in culture (see FIGURE 12.15). In these experiments, two cells in different phases of the cell cycle were fused to form a single cell with two nuclei. If one of the original cells was in the S phase and the other was in G1, the G1 nucleus immediately entered the S phase, as though stimulated by chemicals present in the cytoplasm of the first cell. Similarly, if a cell undergoing mitosis (M phase) was fused with another cell in any stage of its cell cycle, even G1, the second nucleus immediately entered mitosis, with condensation of the chromatin and formation of a spindle (FIGURE 12.12).

Fig 12-15. The effect of a growth factor on cell division. This experiment confirms that platelet-derived growth factor, PDGF, stimulates the division of human fibroblast cells in culture. The basic growth medium is a complex mixture of glucose, amino acids, salts, and antibiotics (as a precaution against bacterial growth). Some culture vessels (controls) contain only this basic medium while others contain the basic medium plus PDGF.

Fig 12-12. Evidence for cytoplasmic chemical signals in cell cycle regulation. Cultured mammalian cells can be induced to fuse, forming a single cell with two nuclei. The results of fusing cells at two different phases of the cell cycle suggested that chemicals control the progression of phases. For example, when a cell in M phase was fused with a cell in any other phase, the second nucleus immediately began mitosis. If the second cell was in G1, as here, the condensed chromosomes that appeared had single chromatids.

These and other experiments demonstrated that the sequential events of the cell cycle are directed by a distinct cell cycle control system, a cyclically operating set of molecules in the cell that both triggers and coordinates key events in the cell cycle. The cell cycle control system has been compared to the control device of an automatic washing machine (FIGURE 12.13). Like the washer's device, the cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, driven by a built-in clock. However, just as a washer's cycle is subject to both external adjustment (such as faucets controlling the water supply) and internal control (such as the sensor that detects when the tub is filled with water), the cell cycle is regulated at certain checkpoints by both internal and external controls.

Fig 12-13. Mechanical analogy for the cell cycle control system. In this diagram of the cell cycle, the flat "stepping stones" around the perimeter represent sequential events. Like the control device of an automatic washer, the cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, driven by a built-in clock. However, the system is subject to regulation at various checkpoints, of which three are shown (red).

Cell Cycle Checkpoints

A checkpoint in the cell cycle is a critical control point where stop and go-ahead signals can regulate the cycle. (The signals are transmitted within the cell by the kinds of signal-transduction pathways discussed in Chapter 11.) Animal cells generally have built-in stop signals that halt the cell cycle at checkpoints until overridden by go-ahead signals. Many signals registered at checkpoints come from cellular surveillance mechanisms; the signals report whether crucial cellular processes up to that point have been completed correctly and thus whether or not the cell cycle should proceed. Checkpoints also register signals from outside the cell, as we will discuss later. Three major checkpoints are found in the G1, G2, and M phases.

For many cells, the G1 checkpoint--dubbed the "restriction point" in mammalian cells--seems to be the most important. If a cell receives a go-ahead signal at the G1 checkpoint, it will usually complete the cycle and divide. Alternatively, if it does not receive a go-ahead signal at that point, it will exit the cycle, switching into a nondividing state called the G0phase. Most cells of the human body are actually in the G0 phase. As mentioned earlier, highly specialized nerve and muscle cells never divide. Other cells, such as liver cells, can be "called back" to the cell cycle by certain environmental cues, such as growth factors released during injury.

To understand how cell cycle checkpoints work, we need to see what kinds of molecules make up the cell cycle control system.

The Cell Cycle Clock: Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases

Rhythmic fluctuations in the abundance and activity of cell cycle control molecules pace the sequential events of the cell cycle. These regulatory molecules are proteins of two main types. Some are protein kinases, enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating them (see Chapter 11). Particular protein kinases give the go-ahead signals at the G1 and G2 checkpoints.

The kinases that drive the cell cycle are actually present at a constant concentration in the growing cell, but much of the time they are in inactive form. To be active, such a kinase must be attached to a cyclin, a protein that gets its name from its cyclically fluctuating concentration in the cell. Because of this requirement, these kinases are called cyclin-dependent kinases, or Cdks. The activity of a Cdk rises and falls with changes in the concentration of its cyclin partner. FIGURE 12.14a shows the fluctuating activity of the cyclin-Cdk complex that was discovered first, called MPF. Note that the peaks of MPF activity correspond to the peaks of cyclin concentration. The cyclin level rises sharply throughout interphase (G1, S, and G2), then falls abruptly during mitosis (M).

Fig 12-14. Molecular control of the cell cycle at the G2 checkpoint. The steps of the cell cycle are timed by rhythmic fluctuations in the activity of a special class of protein kinases. These enzymes are called cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) because they are active only when bound to a cyclin, a protein whose concentration varies cyclically. Here we focus on a Cdk-cyclin complex called MPF, which acts at the G2 checkpoint to trigger mitosis.

The initials MPF stand for "maturation-promoting factor," but we can think of MPF as "M-phase-promoting factor" because it triggers the cell's passage past the G2 checkpoint into M phase (FIGURE 12.14b). When cyclins that accumulate during G2 associate with Cdk molecules, the resulting MPF complex initiates mitosis, apparently by phosphorylating a variety of proteins. MPF acts both directly and indirectly. For example, it causes the nuclear envelope to fragment by phosphorylating--and stimulating still other kinases to phosphory late--proteins of the nuclear lamina, the lining of the nuclear envelope (see FIGURE 7.9).

Later in the M phase, MPF helps switch itself off by initiating a process that leads to the destruction of its cyclin by a special protein breakdown mechanism you will learn about later (see FIGURE 19.11). Protein breakdown is also involved in driving the cell cycle past the M phase checkpoint, which controls the onset of anaphase. The noncyclin part of MPF, the Cdk, persists in the cell in inactive form until it associates with new cyclin molecules synthesized during interphase of the next round of the cycle.

What about the G1 checkpoint? Recent research suggests the involvement of at least three Cdk proteins and several cyclins at this checkpoint. The fluctuating activities of different cyclin-Cdk complexes seem to control all the stages of the cell cycle.





 Internal and external cues help regulate the cell cycle

Research scientists are only in the early stages of working out the signaling pathways that link cyclin-dependent kinases to other molecules and events inside and outside the cell. For example, they know that active Cdks function by phosphorylating substrate proteins that affect particular steps in the cell cycle. But identifying the specific substrates of the various Cdks that become active at different phases of the cell cycle has proved difficult. In other words, scientists don't yet know what Cdks actually do in most cases. However, they have identified some steps of the signaling pathways that convey information to the cell cycle machinery. We'll next discuss two examples of such signaling, one originating inside the cell and one outside.

Internal Signals: Messages from the Kinetochores

Anaphase, the separation of sister chromatids, does not begin until all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle at the metaphase plate. The gatekeeper is the M phase checkpoint, and it ensures that daughter cells do not end up with missing or extra chromosomes. Researchers have learned that a signal that delays anaphase originates at kinetochores that are not yet attached to spindle microtubules. Certain associated proteins trigger a signaling pathway that keeps an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in an inactive state. Only when all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle does this "wait" signal cease. The APC then becomes active and indirectly triggers both the breakdown of cyclin and the inactivation of proteins holding the sister chromatids together.

External Signals: Growth Factors

By growing animal cells in culture, researchers have been able to identify many external factors, both chemical and physical, that can influence cell division. For example, cells fail to divide if an essential nutrient is left out of the culture medium. And even if all other conditions are favorable, most types of mammalian cells divide in culture only if the growth medium includes specific growth factors. As mentioned in Chapter 11, a growth factor is a protein released by certain body cells that stimulates other cells to divide.

One example of a growth factor is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is made by blood cells called platelets. The experiment illustrated in FIGURE 12.15, p. 228, demonstrates that PDGF is required for the division of fibroblasts in culture. Fibroblasts, a type of connective tissue cell, have PDGF receptors on their plasma membranes. The binding of PDGF molecules to these receptors (which are tyrosine-kinase receptors; see Chapter 11) triggers a signal-transduction pathway that leads to stimulation of cell division. Presumably, the pathway activates one or more components of the cell cycle control system.

PDGF stimulates fibroblast division not only in the artificial conditions of cell culture, but in an animal's body as well. When an injury occurs, platelets release PDGF in the vicinity. The resulting proliferation of fibroblasts helps heal the wound. Researchers have discovered a number of different growth factors. Each cell type probably responds specifically to a certain growth factor or combination of growth factors.

The discovery of growth factors provided the key to understanding density-dependent inhibition of cell division, a phenomenon in which crowded cells stop dividing (FIGURE 12.16a). As first observed many years ago, cultured cells normally divide until they form a single layer of cells on the inner surface of the culture container, at which point the cells stop dividing. If some cells are removed, those bordering the open space begin dividing again and continue until the vacancy is filled. Apparently, when a cell population reaches a certain density, the amount of required growth factors and nutrients available to each cell becomes insufficient to allow continued cell growth.

Fig 12-16. Density-dependent inhibition of cell division. Individual cells are shown disproportionately large.

Most animal cells also exhibit anchorage dependence. To divide, they must be attached to a substratum, such as the inside of a culture jar or the extracellular matrix of a tissue. Experiments suggest that anchorage is signaled to the cell cycle control system via pathways involving plasma membrane proteins and elements of the cytoskeleton linked to them. Density-dependent inhibition and anchorage dependence probably function in the body's tissues as well as in cell culture, checking the growth of cells at some optimal density and location. Cancer cells, which we discuss next, exhibit neither density-dependent inhibition nor anchorage dependence (FIGURE 12.16b).





 Cancer cells have escaped from cell cycle controls

Cancer cells do not respond normally to the body's control mechanisms. They divide excessively and invade other tissues. If unchecked, they can kill the organism.

By studying cells growing in culture, researchers have learned that cancer cells do not heed the normal signals that regulate the cell cycle. For example, as FIGURE 12.16b shows, cancer cells do not exhibit density-dependent inhibition when growing in culture; they do not stop dividing when growth factors are depleted. A logical hypothesis to explain this behavior is that cancer cells do not need growth factors in their culture medium in order to grow and divide. They may make a required growth factor themselves or have an abnormality in the signaling pathway that conveys the growth factor's signal to the cell cycle control system--or the cell cycle control system itself may be abnormal. In fact, as you will learn in Chapter 19, these are all possible explanations.

There are other important differences between normal cells and cancer cells that reflect derangements of the cell cycle. If and when they stop dividing, cancer cells do so at random points in the cycle, rather than at the normal checkpoints. Moreover, in culture, cancer cells can go on dividing indefinitely if they are given a continual supply of nutrients; they are said to be "immortal." A striking example is a cell line that has been reproducing in culture since 1951. Cells of this line are called HeLa cells because their original source was from a tumor removed from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. By contrast, nearly all normal mammalian cells growing in culture divide only about 20 to 50 times before they stop dividing, age, and die. (We'll see a possible reason for this phenomenon when we discuss chromosome replication in Chapter 16.)

The abnormal behavior of cancer cells can be catastrophic when it occurs in the body. The problem begins when a single cell in a tissue undergoes transformation, the process that converts a normal cell to a cancer cell. The body's immune system normally recognizes a transformed cell as an insurgent and destroys it. However, if the cell evades destruction, it may proliferate to form a tumor, a mass of abnormal cells within otherwise normal tissue. If the abnormal cells remain at the original site, the lump is called a benign tumor. Most benign tumors do not cause serious problems and can be completely removed by surgery. In contrast, a malignant tumor becomes invasive enough to impair the functions of one or more organs (FIGURE 12.17). An individual with a malignant tumor is said to have cancer.

Fig 12-17. The growth and metastasis of a malignant breast tumor. The cells of malignant (cancerous) tumors grow in an uncontrolled way and can spread to neighboring tissues and, via the circulatory system, to other parts of the body. The spread of cancer cells beyond their original site is called metastasis.

The cells of malignant tumors are abnormal in many ways besides their excessive proliferation. They may have unusual numbers of chromosomes. Their metabolism may be deranged, and they cease to function in any constructive way. Also, owing to abnormal changes on the cells' surfaces, they lose their attachments to neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix and can spread into nearby tissues. Cancer cells may also separate from the original tumor, enter the blood and lymph vessels of the circulatory system, and invade other parts of the body, where they proliferate to form more tumors. This spread of cancer cells to locations distant from their original site is called metastasis (see FIGURE 12.17). If a tumor metastasizes, treatments may include high-energy radiation and chemotherapy with toxic drugs that are especially harmful to actively dividing cells.

Researchers are beginning to understand how a normal cell is transformed into a cancer cell. Though the causes of cancer are diverse, cellular transformation always involves the alteration of genes that somehow influence the cell cycle control system. Our knowledge of how changes in the genome lead to the various abnormalities of cancer cells remains rudimentary, however.

Perhaps the reason we have so many unanswered questions about cancer cells is that there is still so much to learn about how normal cells function. The cell, life's basic unit of structure and function, holds enough secrets to engage researchers well into the future.
