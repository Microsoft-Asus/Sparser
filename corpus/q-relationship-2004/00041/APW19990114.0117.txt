MEXICO CITY
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The government has authorized the first extradition of a major Mexican drug dealer , an official said Thursday , a move that could send Jesus Amezcua to California to face U.S. indictments for methamphetamine smuggling .
Mexico seldom extradites its citizens to the United States , and has never turned over a major Mexican drug suspect .
But persistent requests from the United States -- and Mexico 's own lack of success in prosecuting Amezcua and two of his brothers -- apparently played a role in the decision .
Amezcua and the two brothers were arrested in June .
Authorities say they headed the world 's biggest methamphetamine and ephedrine trafficking operation , with the majority of the drugs going to the United States .
Mexican officials never formally charged any of the men with any drug-related offense .
In interviews with local newspapers , the brothers have denied involvement in drugs .
