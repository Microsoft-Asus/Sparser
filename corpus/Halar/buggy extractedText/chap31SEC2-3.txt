 Fungi disperse and reproduce by releasing spores that are produced sexually or asexually

Fungi reproduce by releasing spores that are produced either sexually or asexually. The output of spores is enormous. For example, puffballs, which are reproductive structures of certain fungi, can puff out clouds containing trillions of spores (see FIGURE 22.8). Carried by wind or water, spores germinate to produce mycelia if they land in a moist place where there is food. Spores thus function in dispersal and account for the wide geographic distribution of many species of fungi. The airborne spores of fungi have even been found more than 160km (100 miles) above Earth. Closer to home, try leaving a slice of bread out for a week or two and you will observe the furry mycelia that grow from the invisible spores raining down from the surrounding air.
