									<a name="para67"></a><p class="BlockText">Some scientists believe that life elsewhere in the universe might be based on the element silicon, rather than on carbon, as on Earth. What properties does silicon share with carbon that would make silicon-based life more likely than, say, neon-based life or aluminum-based life? (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 2.30</span>, p. 32)</p>

									<a name="para69"></a><p class="BlockText">In 1918, an epidemic of sleeping sickness caused an unusual rigid paralysis in some survivors, similiar to symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease. Years later, L-Dopa, a chemical used to treat Parkinson’s disease (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.7</span>), was given to some of these patients, as dramatized in the movie <span class="Emphasis1">Awakenings,</span> L-Dopa was remarkably effective at eliminating the paralysis, at least temporarily. However, its enantiomer, D-Dopa, was subsequently shown to have no effect at all, as is the case for Parkinson’s disease. Suggest a hypothesis to explain why, for <span class="Emphasis1">both</span> diseases, one enantiomer is effective and the other is not.</p>

									<a name="para71"></a><p class="BlockText">Thalidomide achieved notoriety 40 years ago because of a wave of birth defects among children born to women who took thalidomide during pregnancy as a treatment for morning sickness. However, in 1998 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this drug for the treatment of certain conditions associated with Hansen’s disease (leprosy). In clinical trials, thalidomide also shows promise for use in treating patients suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis, and a number of other diseases, including some types of cancer. Do you think approval of this drug is appropriate? If so, under what conditions? What criteria do you think the FDA should use in weighing a drug’s benefits against its dangers?</p>
