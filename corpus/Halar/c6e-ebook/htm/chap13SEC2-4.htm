The two chromosomes of a homologous pair are individual chromosomes that were inherited from different parents. Homologues appear alike in the microscope, but they have different versions of genes at some of their corresponding loci (for example, a gene for freckles on one chromosome and a gene for the absence of freckles at the same locus on the homologue).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig13-6','../fig/big/fig13-6.jpg','fig13-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig13-6.jpg" alt="fig13-6" name="myfig13-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 13-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Overview of meiosis: how meiosis reduces chromosome number.</span> After the chromosomes replicate once, the diploid cell divides <span class="Emphasis1">twice,</span> yielding four haploid daughter cells.
