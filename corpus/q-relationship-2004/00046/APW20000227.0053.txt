CHIRI - YURT , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russian forces have encircled the last major stronghold held by Chechnya 's rebels but face intense and bloody fighting to overcome their heavy defenses , Russian officials said Sunday .
An estimated 2,700 rebels are concentrated around the village of Shatoi , deep in the southern mountains , the last section of Chechnya where rebels have a strong presence .
Russian forces are aiming to wipe out the rebels before spring , when rebels can move more easily than they can in the snow and when new-leafed foliage gives them better cover .
`` There will be no easy road for federals .
Fierce battles are in store , '' a Russian commander , Lt. Gen. Vladimir Bulgakov , was quoted as saying by the news agency ITAR - Tass .
The remaining rebels are `` diehards who have no way out '' and their desperation is expected to drive them to fight intensely .
Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships have pounded the rebels in the mountains heavily for weeks , likely inflicting substantial damage .
But as Russian troops close in , they will not be able to count on air attacks to soften up the strongholds , another top commander said .
Eventually , `` we will not be able to use aviation for fear of damaging our own units , '' said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev , according to ITAR - Tass .
Capt. Andrei Frolov said , `` for us it is difficult , especially in Shatoi where their defense fortifications are even better than in Grozny , '' the Chechen capital where rebels resisted Russian ground troops for months before fleeing in early February .
`` The rebels are trying to break the siege , and some are succeeding , '' Frolov said .
`` In the daytime , they hide and at night appear in groups of 15-20 people and use sniper rifles and grenade launchers '' in their attempt to break out of Shatoi .
Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 120 missions over Chechnya over the past 24 hours , bombarding the Shatoi region and suspected rebel bases in the Argun and Vedeno gorges , the military command told the Interfax news agency .
Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya in late September to fight separatist rebels whom it blamed for apartment bombings in Russia .
The bombings came after Chechnya -based Muslim fighters invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan in August and were driven out by Russian forces .
Many foreign governments and international human-rights groups have made increasing calls on Russia to investigate reports of atrocities including summary execution of civilians and torture of detainees in Chechnya .
