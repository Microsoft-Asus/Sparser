A SURVEY OF PROKARYOTIC DIVERSITY

 

 Molecular systematics is leading to a phylogenetic classification of prokaryotes



 

 Researchers are identifying a great diversity of archaea in extreme environments and in the oceans



 

 Most known prokaryotes are bacteria



In this section, we'll take a closer look at the distinction between archaea and bacteria and then examine a few of the major groups within these two domains of prokaryotic organisms.
