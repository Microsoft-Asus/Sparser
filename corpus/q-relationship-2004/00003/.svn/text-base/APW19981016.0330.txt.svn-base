<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Hume and David Trimble , the leaders of Northern Ireland 's two main political parties , won the Nobel Peace Prize Friday for their efforts to end the sectarian violence that plagued the British province for three decades .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , 61 , head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble , 54 , leader of the Ulster Unionist party</ENAMEX> , were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward ending `` the national religious and social conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives . ''
Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland 's political leaders in his work for a peaceful solution</ENAMEX> , '' the committee said in its citation .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern Ireland , David Trimble showed great political courage when , at a critical stage in the process , he advocated solutions which led to the peace agreement </ENAMEX>, '' the citation said .
The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was signed in April was the work of other Northern Ireland political leaders , as well as the governments of the United Kingdom , the United States and Ireland .
In the days leading up to prize , the Norwegian news media largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also include Gerry Adams , leader of Sein Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army .
At his news conference , Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of the IRA 's terrorist history .
He refused to discuss the deliberations of the committee .
`` We do n't shy away from anyone .
We just try to find the most appropriate laureates , '' Sejersted said .
`` I can only repeat that many people have contributed to this process , not in the least Gerry Adams . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 963,000 -RRB- will be divided equally between Hume and Trimble</ENAMEX> .
At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said : `` Well as you would expect , I am very deeply honored to have received this award today , but I see it not as an award for myself but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland . ''
In Denver early Friday , where Trimble was visiting as part of an 11-city North American tour aimed at promoting investment in the British province , aides refused to wake him for comment , saying he would make a statement later in the day .
It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage peace in Northern Ireland .
The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in founding the International Peace People group , which later fizzled .
`` We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did , '' said Sejersted .
But he said that just illustrated what a long and complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been .
Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords were signed in April .
But `` it indicates that the process is going in on the right track , and that there is reason for optimist , '' the chairman said .
`` We wanted to give it a push . ''
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern , both mentioned a possible winners of this year 's peace prize , immediately praised the decision .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize than David Trimble and John Hume , '' said Blair in London .
`` This is a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership . ''</ENAMEX>
Ahern called it `` a deserved tribute to two of the principal architects '' of the peace agreement .
The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named this year .
The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen , an Indian scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and other catastrophes .
On Tuesday , Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University , Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than particles .
The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions .
On Monday , the medicine prize was given to three Americans -- Robert Furchgott , Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad -- for their work on discovering properties of nitric oxide , a common air pollutant but also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels .
The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago .
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10 , the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel , the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes in his will .
