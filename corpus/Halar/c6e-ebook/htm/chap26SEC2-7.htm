There is fossil evidence that cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic prokaryotes coated damp terrestrial surfaces well over a billion years ago. However, macroscopic life in the form of plants, fungi, and animals did not colonize land until about 500 million years ago, during the early Paleozoic era. This gradual evolutionary venture out of ancestral aquatic environments was associated with adaptations that helped prevent dehydration and that made it possible to reproduce on land. For example, plants, which evolved from green algae, have a waterproof coating of wax on their leaves that slows the loss of water.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Plants colonized land in the company of fungi. Even today, the roots of most plants are associated with fungi that aid in the absorption of water and minerals from the soil. The fungi, in turn, obtain their organic nutrients from the plant. Such symbiotic associations of plants and fungi are evident in some of the oldest fossilized roots, dating this relationship back to the early spread of life onto land. You will learn more about the evolution of plants and fungi in Chapters 29-31.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Plants transformed the landscape, creating new opportunities for all life, including herbivorous (plant-eating) animals and their predators. Although many animal groups are represented in terrestrial environments, the most widespread and diverse land animals are certain arthropods (in the form of insects and spiders) and certain vertebrates (in the form of amphibians such as frogs and salamanders, reptiles such as lizards and snakes, birds, and mammals). The terrestrial vertebrates are called tetrapods, a reference to the four walking limbs that distinguish them from the various aquatic vertebrates we call fishes. An excellent fossil record documents the descent of amphibians from fishes. Reptiles evolved from amphibians, and both birds and mammals evolved from reptiles. Most of the groups (orders) of modern mammals were established by about 50-60 million years ago, including the primates, the order that includes apes and humans. The human lineage diverged from other primates only about 5 million years ago--the most recent second in a clock of life’s history rescaled to represent an hour. But our history, like that of every other species in the rich diversity of life, actually begins with the first organisms to live on the primordial Earth over 3.5 billion years ago.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
