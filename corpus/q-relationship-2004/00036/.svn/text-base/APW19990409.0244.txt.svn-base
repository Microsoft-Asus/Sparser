TAIPEI , Taiwan
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- As China moves closer to entering the World Trade Organization , Taiwan said Friday it will lift an import ban on 150 agricultural products from mainland China to improve its own chances of getting in .
Once China is admitted into the WTO , Taiwan is expected to follow .
And Beijing -- as a member of the trade body -- is expected to demand more such concessions from Taiwan , which could fuel more disputes between the frequently bitter rivals .
Preparing Taiwan to treat China as a fair trading partner under WTO rules , Taiwan 's Economics Ministry said the island will allow the import of Chinese corn , wheat , barley and other farm produce in its largest-ever move to open the Taiwanese market for Chinese goods .
But completely free trade is out of the question for now .
Taiwan will keep its ban on several popular teas to prevent hurting the livelihood of its own tea growers , officials said .
Taiwan also remained vague on a subject that could prove even touchier : Whether to end its ban on air and shipping links with China once both are in the WTO .
The trade body 's rules would call for open transport links .
Taiwan conceivably could try to opt out by citing overriding national security concerns , but Chiang Ping -kun , chairman of the government Council for Economic Planning and Development , said it was too soon to say whether Taiwan would try that .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Beijing claims Taiwan a renegade province -- threatening at military attack if Taiwan ever formally declares independence -- and opposes to its joining any international organizations as a sovereign country .</ENAMEX>
Taiwan and China split politically following a civil war in 1949 , and Taiwan bans official contacts with China .
Taiwan has completed bilateral negotiations with all 26 WTO member countries that demand such talks .
A working committee of the WTO will convene a multilateral session in Geneva late this month or next month to discuss Taiwan 's entry .
In Washington , both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji voiced optimism Thursday that an agreement for China joining the WTO can be reached before the end of this year -- stirring optimism that Taiwan , too , can become part of the body that governs world trade .
Both China and Taiwan should be in by the end of the year , Taiwanese Economics Minister Wang Chih -kang told reporters Friday .
Lin Yih -fu , head of the Board of Foreign Trade , said WTO members would have no reason to postpone Taiwan 's admission further should China meet all requirements to be admitted .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Chinese do n't object to Taiwan being admitted to the WTO -- as long as it is classified as a `` customs territory '' instead of as a nation -- but they have lobbied fiercely against Taiwan getting in ahead of the mainland .</ENAMEX>
