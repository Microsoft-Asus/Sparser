ATLANTA --
United Parcel Service plans to sell public stock for the first time , a move it says is aimed not at raising cash but at creating a market for shares that can be used as currency in future acquisitions .
The delivery giant said Wednesday it will sell 10 percent of its stock , or about 55 million shares , in an offering by the end of the year .
A target price has n't been set .
UPS stock -- now owned by 125,000 employees , along with company trusts and foundations -- is valued internally at $ 47 a share , which would make the offering worth $ 2.7 billion .
But the company expects it to bring substantially more on the open market .
If that happens , UPS ' offering could challenge the $ 4 billion Conoco Inc. public offering of 1998 , which now ranks as the biggest ever .
After the offering , UPS will use the proceeds for a tender offer to employee stockholders who want to sell up to 10 percent of their shares at a newly established market price .
`` The goal is not to raise cash but to make our stock a public currency that can be used in future transactions , '' UPS spokesman Ken Sternad said .
Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Kelly declined to elaborate at a news conference .
`` There really is nothing specific I can talk about , '' he said .
`` We intend to begin this transaction and then begin the process of looking at candidates that may fit our competitive posture . ''
One analyst said the move will give UPS a valuable currency in the modern marketplace of stock -based transactions .
`` It makes perfectly good sense for them to go public , '' said Jeffrey Pittsburg , president of Pittsburg Institutional Inc .
He said likely acquisition targets lie in logistics management or electronic commerce -- hot growth areas for UPS and chief rival Federal Express .
Fedex shares , which are up 42 percent in the past year , fell $ 1.18 3/4 Wednesday to $ 46.31 1/4 .
`` I really do n't think there are any big core business acquisitions , but certainly logistics is one direction UPS wants to go in , '' Pittsburg said .
UPS last month announced a deal to buy Latin America air rights and other assets of Challenge Air , a Miami -based shipper .
The stock offering will end UPS ' status as one of the world 's biggest private companies .
However , the offering is structured so that initially 99 percent of the voting control of the company will stay in the hands of current shareholders .
UPS stock ownership was limited to about 35,000 managers until 1996 , when purchase rights were extended to all workers .
`` This is an historic step for UPS , '' Kelly acknowledged .
`` Under this plan , UPS will continue to be employee-owned and owner-managed , allowing us to preserve the best aspects of our culture while meeting the business challenges of the 21st century . ''
The move was a tightly held secret among UPS ' top executives and board of directors until it was announced to employees , and then the media , on Wednesday .
UPS , founded in 1907 , moved its headquarters to Atlanta in 1991 .
Since then annual revenue has grown from about $ 15 billion to nearly $ 25 billion , making it Georgia 's largest company .
