LAGOS , September 19 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A senior United Nations official has appealed to the international community to treat the security crisis in west Africa with the same urgency that it applied to East Timor .
U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees Soren Jessen - Petersen said in Sierra Leonean capital Freetown Saturday that there was an urgent need for more aid to help some 500,000 war-created refugees in the west African country .
It was only by doing so , could the fragile peace achieved in this country two month ago be consolidated , the British Broadcasting Company -LRB- BBC -RRB- Sunday quoted the U.N. official as saying .
He noted that it was vital that the country 's peace process should be supported and that refugees from the brutal conflict should be helped to return home .
But the international community had not responded with sufficient cash to the humanitarian crisis in Sierra Leone or to the related conflicts in neighboring Liberia and Guinea , he said .
In addition to problems in Sierra Leone , a new crisis is recently brewing between Liberia and Guinea , which has created a new wave of refugees .
