LONDON , September 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The British government Wednesday flatly denied a British newspaper report that Britain was willing to entertain Spanish claims to joint sovereignty over the disputed colony of Gibraltar</ENAMEX> .
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman was quoted by Reuters as saying Wednesday 's Daily Telegraph report on Gibraltar was wrong to suggest Britain was shifting its position over Gibraltar .
She stressed that British Foreign Office minister Joyce Quin had told Gibraltar 's chief minister , Peter Caruana , that Britain remained committed to the Rock 's 1969 constitution .
`` There will be no change in the sovereignty of Gibraltar against the wishes of the people , '' she said , adding that the impetus for change was coming from Gibraltar .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">It was reported Britain opened exploratory talks Monday at expert level with the government of Gibraltar , which would like to modernize its constitution and end its status as a colony .
Spain wants Gibraltar , which was ceded to Britain in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht , to be returned to Spanish rule , but Britain and Gibraltar have rejected the claim .</ENAMEX>
