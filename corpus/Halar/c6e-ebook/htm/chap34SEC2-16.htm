Amniotic eggs and scales on the legs are just two of the reptilian features we see in birds. But modern birds look quite different from modern reptiles because of their feathers and other distinctive flight equipment.</p><p class="Header3">Characteristics of Birds</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Almost every part of a typical bird’s anatomy is modified in some way that enhances flight. The bones have an internal structure that is honeycombed, making them strong but light (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.25</span>). The skeleton of a frigate bird, for instance, has a wingspan of more than 2 m but weighs only about 113 g (4 oz). Another adaptation reducing the weight of birds is the absence of some organs. Females, for instance, have only one ovary. Also, modern birds are toothless, an adaptation that trims the weight of the head. Food is not chewed in the mouth but ground in the gizzard, a digestive organ near the stomach. (Crocodiles also have gizzards, as did some dinosaurs.) The bird’s beak, made of keratin, has proven to be very adaptable during avian evolution, taking on a great variety of shapes suitable for different diets.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-25','../fig/big/fig34-25.jpg','fig34-25');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-25.jpg" alt="fig34-25" name="myfig34-25"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-25.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Form fits function: the avian wing and feather. (a)</span> A wing is supported by a remodeled version of the tetrapod forelimb. <span class="Emphasis2">(b)</span> The honeycombed anatomy of the bones is a flight adaptation that reduces weight. <span class="Emphasis2">(c)</span> A feather consists of a central hollow shaft, from which radiate the vanes. The vanes are made up of barbs, in turn bearing even smaller branches called barbules. Birds have contour feathers and downy feathers. Contour feathers are the stiff ones that contribute to the aerodynamic shapes of the wings and body. Their barbules have hooks that cling to barbules on neighboring barbs. When a bird preens, it runs the length of a feather through its bill, engaging the hooks and uniting the barbs into a precisely shaped vane. Downy feathers lack hooks, and the free-form arrangement of barbs produces a fluffiness that provides excellent insulation because of the trapped air.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Flying requires a great expenditure of energy from an active metabolism. Birds are endothermic; they use their own metabolic heat to maintain a warm, constant body temperature. Feathers and in some species a layer of fat provide insulation that enables birds to retain their metabolically generated heat. An efficient respiratory system and a circulatory system with a four-chambered heart keep tissues well supplied with oxygen and nutrients, supporting a high rate of metabolism. The lungs have tiny tubes leading to and from elastic air sacs that help dissipate heat and reduce the density of the body.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">For safe flight, senses, especially vision, must be acute. Birds have excellent eyes, perhaps the best of all the vertebrates. The visual areas of the brain are well developed, as are the motor areas; flight also requires excellent coordination.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">With brains proportionately larger than those of reptiles and amphibians, birds generally display very complex behavior. Avian behavior is particularly intricate during breeding season, when birds engage in elaborate rituals of courtship. Because eggs are shelled when laid, fertilization must be internal. Copulation involves contact between the mates’ vents, the openings to their cloacas. After eggs are laid, the avian embryo must be kept warm through brooding by the mother, father, or both, depending on the species.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">A bird’s most obvious adaptation for flight is its wings. Bird wings are airfoils that illustrate the same principles of aerodynamics as the wings of an airplane (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.26</span>). Providing power for flight, birds flap their wings by contractions of large pectoral (breast) muscles anchored to a keel on the sternum (breastbone). Some birds, such as eagles and hawks, have wings adapted for soaring on air currents and flap their wings only occasionally; other birds, including hummingbirds, must flap continuously to stay aloft. In either case, it is the shape and arrangement of the feathers that form the wing into an airfoil. The fastest birds are the appropriately named swifts, which can fly 170 km/hr.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-26','../fig/big/fig34-26.jpg','fig34-26');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-26.jpg" alt="fig34-26" name="myfig34-26"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-26.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A bald eagle in flight.</span> Bird wings are airfoils, structures whose shape creates lift by altering air currents. The leading edge of an airfoil is thicker than the trailing edge, its upper surface is somewhat convex, and its under surface is flattened or concave. This shape makes the air passing over the wing travel farther than the air passing under the wing. As a result, air molecules are spaced farther apart (expanded) above the wing than below it. Thus, the air pressure pushing downward on the wing is less than the pressure pushing upward on the wing’s bottom surface. This pressure differential provides the "lift" for flight.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">In being both extremely light and strong, feathers are among the most remarkable of vertebrate adaptations. Feathers are made of keratin, the same protein that forms our hair and fingernails and the scales of reptiles. Feathers may have functioned first as insulation during the evolution of endothermy, only later being co-opted as flight equipment.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">The evolution of flight required radical alteration in body form, but flight provides many benefits. It enhances hunting and scavenging; many birds exploit flying insects, an abundant, highly nutritious food resource. Flight also provides ready escape from earthbound predators and enables some birds to migrate great distances to utilize different food resources and seasonal breeding areas. The bird that travels farthest in its annual migration is the arctic tern, which flies round-trip between the North Pole and South Pole each year.</p><p class="Header3">The Origin of Birds</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Cladistic analyses of fossilized skeletons support the hypothesis that the closest reptilian relatives of birds were the <span class="Emphasis2">theropods,</span> a group of relatively small, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. (The velociraptors of <span class="Emphasis1">Jurassic Park</span> fame were theropods.) Most researchers agree that the ancestor of birds was a feathered theropod. However, some scientists place the origin of birds much earlier, from an ancestor common to both birds and dinosaurs.</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">The most famous Mesozoic bird is <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span>, known from fossils discovered in Bavarian limestone in Germany. This ancient bird lived about 150 million years ago, during the late Jurassic period. Unlike modern birds, but similar to reptiles, <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> had clawed forelimbs, teeth, and a long tail containing vertebrae (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.27</span>). Thus, <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> was even more anatomically similar to dinosaurs than are modern birds. In fact, if it were not for the preservation of its feathers, <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> would probably be classified as a theropod dinosaur. The skeletal anatomy of <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> indicates that it was a weak flyer, perhaps mainly a tree-dwelling glider. A combination of gliding downward and jumping into the air from the ground may have been the precursor of actual flight in the evolution of birds. However, <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> is not considered to be the ancestor of modern birds but probably represents an extinct side branch of avian evolution. Nonetheless, the evolutionary branch that included <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> probably stemmed from an ancestor that also gave rise to the lineage from which modern birds evolved.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig34-27','../fig/big/fig34-27.jpg','fig34-27');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig34-27.jpg" alt="fig34-27" name="myfig34-27"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 34-27.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2"><span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span>, a Jurassic bird-reptile.</span></span></td></tr></table><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">In 1998, paleontologists described a diversity of fossils in Chinese sediments that may help fill in the gap between dinosaurs and early birds such as <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span>. The Chinese fossils are feathered but flightless dinosaurs (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 34.28</span>). Such anatomy is consistent with a hypothesis that feathers evolved as adaptations with functions other than flight, such as thermoregulation or courtship displays for mating. However, the Chinese fossils are about 20 million years <span class="Emphasis1">younger</span> than <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span>. Do the Chinese fossils represent descendants of feathered, flightless dinosaurs that survived for tens of millions of years, even as <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span> and other birds also evolved from those flightless ancestors? This hypothesis makes the prediction that paleontologists may one day unearth flightless dinosaurs with feathers that predate <span class="Emphasis1">Archaeopteryx</span>. Or did these flightless, feathered animals evolve secondarily from early flying birds, analogous to the abandonment of flight in such modern birds as ostriches?
