This "balance of nature" view focused on interspecific competition as a key factor determining community composition and maintaining stability in communities. <span class="Emphasis2">Stability</span> in this context is the tendency of a community to reach and maintain an equilibrium, or relatively constant composition of species, in the face of disturbances. But in many communities, at least on a local scale, change seems to be more common than stability. This recent emphasis on change has led to a <span class="Emphasis2">nonequilibrium model</span> of communities, where communities are seen as constantly changing after being buffeted by disturbances. The key question here is the role of disturbances in affecting community structure and composition.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
