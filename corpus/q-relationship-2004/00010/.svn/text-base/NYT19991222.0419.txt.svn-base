Even in the world of terrorism , where car bombings , political assassinations and hijackings are the norm , the Armed Islamic Group is extreme .
The terrorist organization has made women who do n't wear veils in its native Algeria military targets , called massacres of villagers `` an offering to God '' and loaded a hijacked Air France jetliner with dynamite to spread flaming wreckage on Paris .
It is the group mentioned by law enforcement officials as having possible connections with Ahmed Ressam , who sits in a federal detention center in Seattle and is charged with bringing nitroglycerin into the United States from Canada .
Customs Service inspectors also found urea -- a component for fertilizer and powerful explosives -- and four timing devices in his rental car last week when he arrived in Port Angeles by ferry from Victoria .
French authorities still want to question a former roommate of Ressam 's and an Alergian national about a Paris subway bombing blamed on the Armed Islamic Group , Canadian authorities say .
News reports suggest Ressam may also have ties to a second Algerian who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and may be responsible for bombings in northern France three years ago .
Some members of the Armed Islamic Group may also have ties to Osama bin Laden , the Saudi -born terrorist blamed for bombing two American embassies in Africa last year .
The link is Afghanistan , whose war to drive the Soviet Union from its borders drew volunteer fighters from throughout the Islamic world .
Ressam may have been one of them , according to unconfirmed intelligence reports cited by The New York Times .
That would make him an `` Afghan , '' something of a term of awe in the Islamic world for the men who fought in that war .
Federal investigators are continuing to piece together Ressam 's connections , if any , to terrorist organizations .
Ressam , a would-be grocer and accused thief in his adopted city of Montreal , has been accused of terrorist connections before .
Immigration documents released this week in Canadian courts show Ressam was accused of arms dealing and belonging to a terrorist group in Algeria .
He denied both allegations .
`` To them , I was simply an Islamic terrorist , even though I had never been associated with Islamic movements , '' he states in the documents .
`` I spent a few hellish days in a jail cell .
I was tortured with a rag doused with soap and bleach ...
`` As a result of this suffering and injustice to an innocent man , I fear that the legal system is working against me .
For that reason , I have decided to seek exile . ''
Ressam , who arrived in Montreal in 1994 with a fake French passport , was considered to have given up his request for refugee status in Canada .
Officials later issued a warrant for his arrest when he failed to show up for a hearing that could have prompted his removal from Canada .
The facts of the most recent criminal case he faces in the United States trouble experts on terrorism .
It may mean that the Armed Islamic Group , which so far has confined its activities to Algeria and France , is expanding .
`` They are anti- Western and anti-foreigner , '' said Martha Crenshaw , an expert on terrorism and government professor at Connecticut 's Wesleyan University .
`` As far as I know , they have never acted outside the context of France and Algeria . ''
David Harris , a former Canadian intelligence official , said Ressam 's actions may say something about the organization behind him .
The results of surveillance may be the reason that Ressam tried to cross into the United States at out-of-the-way Port Angeles , said Harris , former chief of strategic planning of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service .
`` You could argue that the slow-boat-to- China approach is in a way a little pedestrian .
But maybe it was regarded as the least suspicious .
There may have been a reconnaissance cell that decided security was not as tight there . ''
There also has been speculation that Ressam may have been only a courier .
He had reservations for one night in Seattle and plane tickets for London the next day .
That would mean a larger organization -- one that had taken some care in planning .
`` Yes , it may have been that he was just a courier , '' Harris said .
`` But that division of labor is itself ominous . ''
Crenshaw doubts that the Armed Islamic Group has designs on the United States .
Ressam may be `` a kind of freelancer , not representing the Algerian group , '' said Crenshaw , whose first book was about terrorism in Algeria .
`` Where 's the plausible motive ?
It 's more likely the bin Laden group and not the Armed Islamic Group , '' she said .
She and Harris said there are likely connections between Algerian terrorist groups and bin Laden .
Some members of the Armed Islamic Group fought with other Islamic rebels in Afghanistan and are called `` Afghans . ''
To many inside the group , the `` Afghans '' were regarded as especially tough , veteran fighters , Crenshaw said .
Bin Laden has training camps in Afghanistan and has reportedly trained Algerians there .
The Armed Islamic Group , as well as the ongoing blood-letting in Algeria , has its roots in the early 1990s .
Islamic fundamentalists won a majority of seats in the Algerian National Assembly in elections in December 1991 .
The government canceled a second round of elections set for January 1992 , throwing the country into civil war .
One terrorist group , the Islamic Salvation Front , began violently resisting the government .
A few years ago , however , it called a truce .
The Armed Islamic Group has no interest in truces , negotiations or compromises .
It is known by the acronym GIA , for its name in French , Groupe Islamique Arme .
In 1993 , the group issued an ultimatum ordering all foreigners to leave Algeria .
It has since been blamed for the deaths of at least a hundred foreigners there , according to the U.S. State Department .
And members have no regrets for killing women not wearing the traditional hijab , or veil .
The GIA is thought to operate in autonomous cells , each commanded by an emir .
Its numbers may run into the hundreds or thousands .
Inside Algeria , the GIA has been blamed for the massacres of entire villages .
There have been reports of women who have been raped and disemboweled , and babies who have had their throats cut , then been burned in ovens .
The GIA has declared the government and its supporters , and civilians who do n't oppose the government , its enemies .
`` The seemingly indiscriminate and horrific violence against civilians -- including women and children -- was condemned widely in domestic and international circles and eroded Islamic support for the group abroad , '' the State Department reported last year .
In 1994 , the GIA took its campaign to France .
Algeria was once a French colony , and France continues to provides nearly $ 1 billion annually to the Algerian government .
`` They were on the A -team of Islamic extremists in France , '' Harris said .
On Christmas Eve 1994 , four hijackers with the GIA seized an Air France jet in Algeria , killed three passengers and rigged 20 sticks of dynamite on the plane .
Their plan was to blow up the plane , which carried 173 passengers and crew , over Paris .
However , the plane landed at Marseille , where French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers .
The GIA claimed responsibility for the hijacking .
Later , the GIA embarked on a campaign of terror in Paris , according to French investigators .
In July 1995 , a subway bombing in Paris killed seven people and wounded more than 80 .
The GIA may be getting sustenance from North America .
Police have warned that a ring of thieves and extortionists in Montreal may be using their proceeds to help bankroll terrorist groups in Algeria .
Montreal is home to an estimated 15,000 Algerian immigrants .
`` It may sound like amateur hour , '' said Harris , `` but it 's a very fundamental way to raise money that kills . ''
Groups like the Irish Republican Army have used bank robberies and other crimes to finance terrorism , he said .
