NEW DELHI , India
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee reiterated his country 's angry objections to pressure from the U.N. Security Council to scrap its nuclear weapons program , telling lawmakers India would not let anyone tell it what to do .
His statement in India 's upper house of Parliament was quoted by local news agencies .
It came two days after the 15-member Council asked both India and Pakistan , longtime rivals who escalated their arms race with a series of tit-for-tat nuclear tests last month , to resume talks to solve their disputes , especially over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir they both claim .
The Indian government on Saturday released a statement calling the Security Council resolution `` coercive and unhelpful . ''
Monday , Vajpayee reiterated his oft-repeated statement since his May 11-13 nuclear tests that India will not let any other nation mediate in the Kashmir dispute .
India has consistently resisted international pressure on Kashmir , while Pakistan welcomes intervention because it feels at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its much larger and more powerful neighbor .
India had sought to hold talks with Pakistan since January , but Islamabad has not replied to New Delhi 's proposals , Vajpayee told Parliament .
The Security Council also called on India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and a test ban accord .
India has repeatedly refused to sign the treaties because they do not require the traditional nuclear powers -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- to give up their nuclear arsenals .
Pakistan says it will sign the treaty only if India does so .
Vajpayee said Monday that India 's nuclear policy would be dictated by its security concerns .
He has said in the past that India went nuclear because of its fears of being surrounded by the nuclear weapons of neighbors China and Pakistan .
In its response to the Security Council , Pakistan said Sunday that it cannot be compelled to sign the nuclear arms control treaties .
It also expressed disappointment that the council 's resolution did not offer concrete steps toward resolving the Kashmir dispute .
Two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought in the last 50 years were over Kashmir , a former kingdom that had a Muslim majority and a Hindu ruler .
Officially Islamic Pakistan holds one-third of Kashmir , and India 's two-thirds is the only Muslim -majority state in the predominantly Hindu country .
