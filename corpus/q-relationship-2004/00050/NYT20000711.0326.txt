RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil --
In an effort to revive the Colombian government 's sharply declining political and economic fortunes , President Andres Pastrana replaced more than a third of his cabinet Tuesday , bringing in several figures associated with opposition parties in hopes of dampening their campaign to cripple his government .
The long-anticipated cabinet reshuffle comes as the Clinton administration is poised to begin delivering an emergency $ 1.3 billion aid package , composed mostly of military assistance , to Colombia and neighboring countries .
The money is intended to slow a huge increase in cocaine and heroin production and thereby weaken the finances of Marxist - Leninist guerrilla groups that have been fighting the Colombian government since the mid-1960s .
`` This is a cabinet of national unity , of great openness , '' said Minister of the Interior Humberto de la Calle , himself a member of the opposition Liberal Party who took office barely three months ago .
Of the 22 posts in the cabinet , slightly more than half are now held by members of Pastrana 's Conservative Party , with the rest in the hands of Liberals and independents .
Nine changes were announced as a result of the the shakeup , which began Friday night with the resignation of Minister of Finance Juan Camilo Restrepo .
Planning Director Mauricio Cardenas and Minister of Economic Development Jaime Cabal Sanclemente stepped down Tuesday , meaning that all three of the government 's top economic leaders will be new .
The reshuffle did not , though , affect the two officials who have the most contact with the United States and are most closely identified with the American aid package , part of a larger $ 7.5 billion counter-narcotics and social support program that Pastrana calls `` Plan Colombia . ''
Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna remains as minister of defense , while Guillermo Fernandez de Soto continues in the foreign affairs portfolio .
But the composition of the restructured cabinet pitches the Pastrana government somewhat further to the left .
The new minister of labor , Angelino Garzon , for instance , is a former president of the country 's largest trade union federation and was also a vice president of the Patriotic Union , a leftist political coalition with links to leftist guerrillas that was all but wiped out by paramilitary death squads in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
`` We consider Angelino Garzon to be a friend of the labor movement and wish him success in his new post , '' Julio Roberto Gomez , president of the General Confederation of Democratic Workers , a labor group that has often quarreled with Pastrana , told a local radio station .
`` We regard his appointment as a piece of good news . ''
Pastrana took office two years ago next month with the highest vote total ever recorded by a candidate for president of Colombia .
But he has been weakened , among other things , by an apparent lack of progress in peace negotiations with the two main guerrilla groups and by what economic analysts describe as the worst recession in a century , with unemployment at 20 percent and the peso at an all-time low against the dollar .
Hoping to arrest that decline , this spring he proposed a referendum to replace Congress , which is dominated by the Liberals and is widely seen as corrupt and ineffective , with a new and more-streamlined body .
But the plan backfired , and Pastrana was left with a poisoned relationship with Congress and a diminished ability to govern , after legislators suggested that the president 's job be put to a vote as well .
