BEIJING --
Unlike most Westerners , Roger Barrett does n't think of North Korea as a weird , hermetic country on the edge of disaster .
To him , it 's a business opportunity just waiting to be seized .
`` -LRB- North Korea -RRB- is very willing to do business with the rest of the world , '' he says .
`` The rest of the world does n't realize that . ''
No , while the rest of the world wonders just how many hundreds of thousands died in its recent famine and hopes it stops work on its long-range missile program , Barrett is running a business association for companies looking to trade and invest in the world 's most isolated country .
With the conclusion this week of a historic summit between North and South Korea in which the reclusive and enigmatic leader Kim Jong Il showed himself to be a likeable and competent statesman , `` there 'll be increased levels of interest ... and a mindset that -LRB- North Korea -RRB- might be a place to do business , '' Barrett believes .
Adding fuel to that potential fire , U.S. officials quickly began working to lift sanctions against North Korea following the three-day summit in Pyongyang .
President Clinton announced in September the easing of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against North Korea , as a reward for agreeing to a moratorium on testing of long-range missiles that could strike U.S. territory .
With the summit ending in an atmosphere of unprecedented goodwill , U.S. officials said on Thursday they would announce soon the procedures for implementing Clinton 's decision -- perhaps as early as this week .
Two years ago , Barrett helped form the Foreign Business Development Association in Beijing , which now boasts more than 30 members , including three American companies .
With the blessing of the authorities in Pyongyang , the association , run like a chamber of commerce , promotes some government projects while helping member companies navigate the nuances of North Korea .
Barrett , a British businessman who has been working in Asia on-and-off for 18 years , could n't be more enthusiastic about the potential for profit in a country with a Stalinist political climate and perpetual shortage of foreign currency .
He proudly displays glossy photos of a clean and modern-looking downtown Pyongyang .
He points to President Kim Jong - Il 's unexpected appearance at the airport Tuesday to greet South Korean President Kim Dae - Jung .
`` That 's what I mean about willingness and openness , '' he says .
Indeed , North Korea has recently shown a desire to emerge from its shell , establishing diplomatic ties with Australia and Italy earlier this year and inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin for a visit next month .
When it comes to details of actual business deals , Barrett is almost as secretive as the North Koreans .
He wo n't say which companies are members of the association , how much they 've invested or what kind of projects they 're exploring .
Members demand confidentiality , he said , partly for competitive reasons and partly because of North Korea 's image problem .
`` An American member said to me , ` Americans are led to believe they 'd either be shot or eaten if they go -LRB- to North Korea -RRB- , ' '' Barrett said .
The United States frequently refers to North Korea as a `` rogue state . ''
Although Washington may soon lift many investment and trade sanctions , `` if it 's known -LRB- a public company -RRB- is involved in North Korea , that has an adverse affect on the share price , '' he said .
Barrett claims that `` tourism is set to grow . ''
In fact , a Hong Kong developer has built a luxury hotel and casino in a trade zone near the Chinese border .
Barrett imagines Chinese tourists flocking to the Emperor Casino to gamble and enjoy the nearby beaches .
Among the few companies willing to admit membership in the association are Allied - Pickford , the American shipping firm , and Millizer and Munch , a Swiss forwarding company .
Uwe Behrens , director of Millizer 's joint-venture in Beijing , is much more frank about the business climate in North Korea .
`` I do n't know of any successful investments or joint ventures , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">South Korean conglomerates have long been the biggest investors in the North , but it 's difficult to assess how they 're doing .</ENAMEX>
Still , Behrens ' company is managing to make a small profit by transporting goods into and out of North Korea , mostly shipping in foreign aid .
The outbound traffic is supplied by the few North Korean factories still exporting , namely some textiles , a machine tools company and a piano factory , Behrens said .
Even though it has been 10 years since he started his company 's operations in North Korea , he believes it 's only a matter of time before business starts to boom there .
`` We are considering that if there comes a certain opening , . . . then from overseas comes a lot of cargo , '' Behrens said .
`` So for this time we are ready . ''
