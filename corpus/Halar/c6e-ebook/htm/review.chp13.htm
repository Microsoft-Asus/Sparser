Differentiated cells from mature plants are often totipotent, capable of generating a complete new plant.

A cascade sequentially activates three sets of segmentation genes. First, products of gap genes map out subdivisions along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Next, pair-rule genes define the pattern in terms of pairs of segments.

Organ identity genes determine the type of structure (stamen, carpal, sepal, or petal) that grows from each whorl of a floral meristem.
