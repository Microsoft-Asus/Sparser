THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS

 

 The three levels of biodiversity are genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity



 

 Biodiversity at all three levels is vital to human welfare



 

 The four major threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction, introduced species, overexploitation, and food chain disruptions



Extinction is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring almost since life first evolved; it is the current rate of extinction that underlies the biodiversity crisis. Because we can only estimate the number of species currently existing, we cannot determine the actual rate of species loss or the real magnitude of the biodiversity crisis. We do know for certain that we are experiencing a high rate of species extinction caused by an escalating rate of ecosystem degradation by a single species--Homo sapiens. Conservation biology is about trying to understand what is happening to biodiversity, why it is happening, and what we can do about it.
