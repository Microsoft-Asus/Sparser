CANBERRA , December 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- For Australia , the Asia financial crisis is a touchstone , which tests the nation both economically and diplomatically .
Speaking of Australia 's relations with Asia , Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer has noted that `` the fact is , and will always remain , that the same seas that wash our shore wash yours , that the majority of our trade routes pass this way , and that our future is irrevocably bound up with that of the region that surrounds us '' , `` in both security and economic terms there is no region where more significant Australian interests are engaged . ''
In view of this fact , the Australian government pursues a foreign policy of active engagement with Asia , attaches a top priority to Asian affairs , and is committed to making a lasting contribution to the region .
Since the financial turmoil surfaced in Southeast Asia last year , Australia has contributed , through the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- , three billion U.S. dollars to the hard-hit nations of Thailand , South Korea and Indonesia .
It also offered humanitarian assistance to help Indonesia alleviate the combined impact of economic crisis and political turmoil .
In addition , Australia has also committed to continuing bilateral assistance programs with a number of economies including the Philippines , Malaysia , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia and Mongolia , with a total amount of more than 400 million Australian dollars -LRB- 260 million U.S. dollars -RRB- .
Australia also played a key role in lobbying and coordinating international community raising funds to Indonesia .
In Australia 's views , Asia , particularly East Asia , has been and remains one of the most important engines for global economic growth .
Australia has deeply integrated itself with the Asian market .
Its ! ! exports to East Asia increased at a rate of 60 percent in the past couple of years .
During last month 's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- meeting in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , Australia tried its best to push the APEC in accelerating the process of trade liberalization , and to persuade the participants of the meeting to reaffirm the commitment to the Bogor agreement on introducing free trade by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for other APEC economies .
The OPEC program for accelerated liberalization of 15 sectors is crucial to maintaining that momentum .
These sectors worth over 900 billion U.S. dollars , or more than half , of intra- APEC trade include areas of substantial interest to Australia , such as autos , food , energy , chemicals , fish , environmental products , gems and precious metals .
Trade liberalization , as Australians see it , is not only an issue for its own trade , but also serves its strategic aims .
And it is clear , the regional security environment is , to a great extent , determined by the changing relationship among major powers , while a desirable peaceful and stable relationship among the major powers emerges only from a background where all the economies become increasingly interdependent economically and strategically .
A free trade environment without tariff barrier just serves this purpose .
And over the years , Australia has evolved its own way of dealing with state-to-state affairs in Asia .
Australia underlines the importance of peaceful resolution of differences and fosters a sense of common interest and shared responsibility for the region 's future .
In Prime Minister John Howard 's words , different countries have varying views and cultures about their system of government and no foreign countries should be seen to be lecturing other countries on how to run their government .
