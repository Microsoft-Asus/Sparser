DNA is partitioned among chromosomes, making it easier for the eukaryotic cell to replicate and distribute its huge amounts of DNA. Chromosomes consist of chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein that condenses during mitosis. When chromosomes replicate, they form identical sister chromatids. The chromatids separate during mitosis, becoming the chromosomes of the new daughter cells.</p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 12A: <span class="Emphasis1">Roles of Cell Division</span></span></p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">THE MITOTIC CELL CYCLE</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The mitotic phase alternates with interphase in the cell cycle: <span class="Emphasis1">an overview</span> (p. 217,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 12.4</span>, <span class="SmallCap">12.5</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Mitosis and cytokinesis make up the M (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle. Between divisions, cells are in interphase: the G<SUB>1</SUB>, S, and G<SUB>2</SUB> phases. The cell grows throughout interphase, but DNA is replicated only during the S (synthesis) phase. Mitosis is a continuous process, often described as occurring in five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.</p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 12B: <span class="Emphasis1">The Cell Cycle</span></span></p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The mitotic spindle distributes chromosomes to daughter cells: <span class="Emphasis1">a closer look</span> (PP. 220-221,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 12.6</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The mitotic spindle is an apparatus of microtubules that controls chromosome movement during mitosis. The spindle arises from the centrosomes, organelles near the nucleus that in animal cells include centrioles. Spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores of chromatids and move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate. In anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles of the cell. Using motor proteins, each kinetochore moves along shortening microtubules. Meanwhile, nonkinetochore microtubules from opposite poles slide past each other, elongating the cell. In telophase, daughter nuclei form at opposite ends of the cell.</p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm: <span class="Emphasis1">a closer look</span> (pp. 221-222,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 12.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Mitosis is usually followed by cytokinesis, involving cleavage furrows in animals and cell plates in plants.</p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 12C: <span class="Emphasis1">Mitosis and Cytokinesis Animation</span></span></p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity 12D: <span class="Emphasis1">Mitosis and Cytokinesis Video</span></span></p><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in The Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">How Much Time Do Cells Spend in Each Phase of Mitosis?</span></span></p></LI><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Mitosis in eukaryotes may have evolved from binary fission in bacteria (pp. 223-224,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 12.10</span>, <span class="SmallCap">12.11</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> During binary fission, the two daughter bacterial chromosomes actively move apart by a mechanism that is not yet understood.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">REGULATION OF THE CELL CYCLE</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">A molecular control system drives the cell cycle (pp. 224-227,</span> <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 12.13</span>-<span class="SmallCap">12.14</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Cyclic changes in regulatory proteins work as a mitotic clock.
