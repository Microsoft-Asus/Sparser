LONDON , March 4 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- British Trade Secretary Stephen Byers summoned the U.S. ambassador to receive a protest over Washington 's actions in the dispute over European Union banana imports .
Byers branded the U.S. announcement that importers would need to buy bonds to cover a range of European goods `` irrational and unacceptable '' , saying the British Government will step in and guarantee the bonds being demanded by US customs on cashmere imports .
The British Department of Trade and Industry sources said the bonds effectively amounted to 100 percent tariffs , As such they may pose a threat to jobs in the E.U. and the U.K , a BBC report said , quoting Byers as stating that `` We 've taken steps to protect jobs and industry '' .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair later added his voice to the government 's chorus of determination to stand up to the United States on this issue .
During a visit to Glasgow , Blair said he would do everything possible to protect the Scottish textile industry from trade tariffs .
`` No one should be in any doubt about our determination to make sure British jobs and Scottish jobs are protected , '' he said .
`` As a result of what we have already done , we have managed to get this decision postponed . ''
More than 2,000 Scottish jobs depend on the cashmere industry , which made exports worth about 18 million pounds -LRB- about 29 million U.S. dollars -RRB- to the United States last year .
Responding earlier to an emergency Commons question , Byers told members of parliament that the British cashmere knitwear industry could be badly affected by `` completely unauthorised '' U.S. actions .
The row over bananas centres on American complaints that the E.U. gives unfair import preference to bananas from former British and French colonies in the Caribbean .
They say this comes at the expense of U.S. firms seeking to export bananas from the dollar economies of Latin America .
Byers explained that the dispute had been put to the World Trade Organisation arbitrator , which has delayed a final ruling .
The U.S. argued the duties would not be applied until after the arbitrator had ruled .
`` I deplore the action which the US has taken , '' Byers said .
`` It is completely unauthorised by any WTO procedures and wholly ignores the arbitrator 's appeal for discussions to continue . ''
`` Even now it is not too late for the US to reverse this decision in the interests not only of E.U. - U.S. relationships , but to safeguard the whole framework of dispute settlement in the WTO . ''
