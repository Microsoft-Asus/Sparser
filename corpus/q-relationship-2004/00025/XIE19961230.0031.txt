Tsang Hin Chi said that the Garrison Law not only guarantees that Hong Kong will be safe from foreign invasion , but will also help maintain Hong Kong 's security and stability .
He said that PLA troops stationed in Hong Kong are a symbol of China 's sovereignty , and that the Garrison Law is very important for the region .
It is only with a stable Hong Kong , that the region can have a prosperous economy and its people can live and work in peace , he said , noting that the law provides a legal basis for the troops stationed in Hong Kong , and it will help them carry out their defence duties .
Pointing out that the expenditures of the British army in Hong Kong are borne by the people of Hong Kong , while those of the PLA in Hong Kong will be covered by the Central People 's Government , Tsang said this policy shows consideration for the people of Hong Kong , and they are quite satisfied with it .
Tsang said he had visited the troops to be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR , in Shenzhen , stressing that the troops are well-trained and amiable with strict disciplines .
`` With such good troops stationed in Hong Kong , and with the systematic Garrison Law that fits Hong Kong 's reality , the people of Hong Kong can rest assured , '' he added .
