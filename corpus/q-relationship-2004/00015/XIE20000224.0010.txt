ISLAMABAD , February 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The International Narcotic Control Board of the United Nations warned Wednesday that drug abuse has been on the rise in South Asia .
The board , in a report launched across the world Wednesday , said , `` There seems to be millions of drugs abusers in the region . ''
While cannabis and opium have traditionally been the main drugs of the abuse , the abuse of heroin and synthetic drugs is rapidly increasing , it said .
The number is particularly high along the main trafficking routes and in major drug trafficking areas such as the southwestern border area of Bangladesh and India .
Because of the increasing abuse of heroin by injection and sharing of needles , the number of HIV - AIDS cases is rising in most countries in South Asia , though the preferred mode of administering heroin continues to be inhalation , it noted .
Because of proximity of South Asia to the world 's two main opiate-producing countries Afghanistan and Myanmar , drug trafficking and drug abuse in the region have been mainly related , the report said .
Approximately 75 percent of the world production of opium takes place in Afghanistan with cultivation spreading to new areas , the report noted , saying that in 1999 production reached a record level of 4,600 tons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The report said a large quantity of heroin has been smuggled out of Afghanistan and out of Myanmar and into countries in South Asia , mainly to be shipped further to illicit markets in Europe and North America , but also to be abused locally .</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">It said the supply of illicit opiate from Southwest Asia continues and may increase as a result of record opium harvest in Afghanistan .</ENAMEX>
Trafficking in raw opium and heroin from northwestern Myanmar has been on the rise for the past few years .
The illicit cultivation of opium poppy and the production of opiates are also taking place in various parts of India and Nepal , it said .
Meanwhile , the board noted with satisfaction that a number of countries in South Asia are devoting increased attention to the prevention of the drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts and to the involvement of non-governmental organizations in those activities .
