BEIJING , June 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Chinese and Russian experts have forecast that Sino - Russian economic cooperation is expected to climb to a higher level in 10 to 15 years as a number of key projects have been launched .
They include the construction of the Tianwan Nuclear Plant , the biggest Sino - Russian cooperative energy project , in October last year , as well as the operation of the Russian -made generators in the Shuizhong Power Plant , China 's largest power plant .
Experts say the trend is encouraging , and is likely to open a new chapter for economic cooperation between the two nations , which share the longest borderline in the world .
Currently Russia ranks ninth among China 's trade partners .
Bilateral trade volume reached 5.73 billion U.S. dollars last year , up 4.4 percent over 1998 .
In the first quarter of this year , trade increased by remarkable 26.7 percent to reach 1.42 billion U.S. dollars .
Professor Qin Xuanren from the China Economic and Trade University estimated that the growth will continue and bilateral trade volume will reach a record 6 billion U.S. dollars this year .
China and Russia established a close economic tie in the 1950s , and many people have noted that abundant natural resources and huge markets would benefit both sides if they continue the cooperation .
However , their economic cooperation lags far behind their political relationship .
To reverse this trend , leaders of the two countries have reiterated that they should cooperate in every specific area and lay a solid foundation for their strategic cooperative relationship .
