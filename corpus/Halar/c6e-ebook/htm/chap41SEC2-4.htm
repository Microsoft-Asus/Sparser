(We’ll stretch "by the piece" to include parasites such as tapeworms that absorb organic molecules from host organisms across their body surface.) In general, animals fit into one of three dietary categories. <span class="Emphasis2">Herbivores,</span> such as gorillas, cows, hares, and many snails, eat mainly autotrophs (plants, algae). <span class="Emphasis2">Carnivores,</span> such as sharks, hawks, spiders, and snakes, eat other animals. <span class="Emphasis2">Omnivores</span> regularly consume animals as well as plant or algal matter. Omnivorous animals include cockroaches, crows, bears, raccoons, and humans, who evolved as hunters, scavengers, and gatherers.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The terms <span class="Emphasis1">herbivore, carnivore</span>, and <span class="Emphasis1">omnivore</span> represent the kinds of food an animal usually eats and the adaptations enabling it to obtain and process that food. However, most animals are opportunistic, eating foods that are outside their main dietary category when these foods are available. For example, cattle and deer, which are herbivores, may occasionally eat small animals or bird eggs, along with grass and other plants. Most carnivores obtain some nutrients from plant materials that remain in the digestive tract of the prey they eat. And all animals consume bacteria with other types of food.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
