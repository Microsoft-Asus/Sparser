BEIJING , February 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The Chinese People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- troops to be stationed in Hong Kong should build , with their deeds , an image of being full of power and civility when they are garrisoned in Hong Kong from July 1 , 1997 .
This remark was made by Jiang Zemin , general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China -LRB- CPC -RRB- and chairman of the Central Military Commission , during his first inspection of the PLA troops to be stationed in Hong Kong on December 6 , 1995 .
In the company of Major - General Liu Zhenwu , commander of the PLA Hong Kong Troops , and Political Commissar Xiong Ziren , Jiang visited an infantry company and inquired about the daily lives and training of the troops .
During the inspection the general secretary said that it is only 500-odd days from China 's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong .
The troops shoulder a glorious yet arduous task entrusted by the country and the Party , he reminded them .
He said he expected them to make special contributions to the garrison of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .
Citing the consistent concern shown by Jiang Zemin for these troops , a Xinhua report said the general secretary scrutinized a report on the formation of the PLA Hong Kong Troops on October 2 , 1990 and gave his first instruction : The most important thing for the PLA Hong Kong Troops is to be perfect politically .
Since the formation of this contingent in early 1993 Jiang has made a series of directions governing various aspects of the troops , especially the quality of its members .
When the PLA Hong Kong Troops , consisting of ground , naval and air forces , took shape in 1994 , Jiang repeatedly told Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen , vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission , the PLA Hong Kong Troops should have a clear understanding that garrisoning Hong Kong is different from entering Shanghai in the early liberation days .
China is to act in accordance with the principle of `` one country , two systems '' when it resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 , and Hong Kong will be run by Hong Kong residents themselves , he explained .
Jiang put forward a set of criteria for the PLA Hong Kong Troops when he attended a panel discussion at the third session of the Eighth National People 's Congress held in March 1995 , stating that the troops should be first-rate in political and ideological education , military training , discipline and management .
