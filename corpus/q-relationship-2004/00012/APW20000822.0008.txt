WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- - Four years after an explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800 and killed all 230 aboard , federal investigators are taking what they hope will be a final look into the mystery of what happened .
The National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day meeting Tuesday to review the evidence collected in its investigation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Speculation has ranged from a spark caused by electrical wiring , to turbulence caused by another aircraft , bombs , even a missile .</ENAMEX>
There has even been a suggestion that the answer may never be known .
What has become apparent in the long , costly probe is the Boeing 747 was destroyed by an explosion that originated in its central fuel tank on July 17 , 1996 , shortly after takeoff on a New York to Paris flight .
Even without knowing what ignited the Flight 800 blast , the investigation has led to extensive changes in design and regulation that are expected to improve safety in the years to come .
Shortly after the crash , investigators determined that the plane 's almost-empty center fuel tank exploded , but they have not settled on the source of ignition .
One possibility that has been widely discussed is electrical wiring passing near or through the fuel tank .
The plane had spent considerable time waiting for takeoff on the runway , and air conditioners located beneath the fuel tank could have caused it to overheat .
Since the focus shifted toward the fuel tank , the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered 37 corrective actions for commercial airliners .
Among them are replacing sharp-edged fuel probes that might damage wires , keeping pumps idle unless they are submerged in fuel , installing protective sleeves on wiring in tanks and developing electronic devices to suppress power surges in wiring .
Beth Erickson , head of aircraft certification for the FAA , said the agency has reviewed the history of fuel tanks on 10,000 commercial and noncombat military planes and found few problems .
Industry also participated , reporting a week ago that a three-year study concluded airline fuel tanks are safe .
The Air Transport Association , the airline industry 's trade association , said more than 100,000 work hours were spent inspecting 990 aircraft operated by 160 airlines as part of the program .
Erickson said the FAA determined that three factors are needed for a fuel-tank explosion : flammable vapors , oxygen and an ignition source .
Changes are being made in all three areas : eliminating sparks ; inerting , or filling the empty area of fuel tanks with nitrogen rather than allowing in air that contains potentially flammable oxygen ; reducing vapors by keeping tanks fuller ; cooling fuel tanks ; and changing fuel formulas .
Early in the investigation the possibility of a bomb led the government to tighten security procedures .
Investigators have not reported evidence of explosives , either from a bomb or a missile .
Eyewitness reports of streaks of light seen nearby on the night of the crash have continued to plague investigators and to fuel conspiracy theories .
That led the NTSB to go so far as to test-fire missiles to determine just what witnesses might have been able to see on the night of the crash .
This month a group of skeptics in Springfield , Mass. , sued the government seeking details of its inquiry into the crash , including radar data and information on material found with some of the victims ' bodies .
Retired Navy pilot William Donaldson , a vocal critic of the investigation , issued a statement Monday contending that the government is determined to cover up the cause of the crash .
