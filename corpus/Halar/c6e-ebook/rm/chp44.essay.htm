Compare and contrast the Malpighian tubule with the nephron in regard to anatomy, relationship to circulation, and physiological mechanisms for conserving body water.</p>

									<a name="para94"></a><p class="BlockText">Eastern tent caterpillars (<span class="Emphasis1">Malacosoma americanum</span>) live in sizable groups in silk nests, or tents, which they construct in cherry trees. They are among the first insects to become active in the spring, emerging very early in the season--a time when the caterpillars regularly contend with large daily temperature fluctuations, from freezing to very hot conditions. Observing a colony over the course of a day, you notice striking differences in group behavior: Early in the morning, the black caterpillars rest in a tightly packed group on the east-facing surface of the tent. In midafternoon the group is found on the tent undersurface, each caterpillar individually hanging from the tent by just a few of its legs. Propose a hypothesis to explain this behavior. How could you test your hypothesis?</p>

									<a name="para96"></a><p class="BlockText">Kidneys were the first organs to be successfully transplanted. A donor can live a normal life with a single kidney, making it possible for individuals to donate a kidney to an ailing relative or even an unrelated individual with a similar tissue type. In some countries, poor people <span class="Emphasis1">sell</span> kidneys to transplant recipients through organ brokers. What are some of the ethical issues associated with this organ commerce?</p>
