WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized his chief spokesman for `` a serious lapse of judgment '' in releasing information from Linda Tripp 's personnel file in 1998 , but critics say Cohen let Kenneth Bacon off the hook for what amounted to a `` smear campaign '' against Tripp .
The Pentagon on Thursday released an inspector general 's report which found that Bacon and Clifford H. Bernath -- who at the time was Bacon 's chief deputy -- had violated Tripp 's privacy rights by providing information from Tripp 's security clearance records to a reporter for The New Yorker magazine .
The IG report recommended that Cohen take `` appropriate corrective action , '' but was not more specific .
In response , Cohen sent letters to Bacon , the assistant secretary for public affairs , and to Bernath , `` to express my disappointment '' in their judgment .
Cohen said their actions were `` hasty and ill-considered , '' but added : `` This was a departure from the very high quality of performance that you have otherwise exhibited . ''
Cohen noted that the inspector general found that neither Bacon nor Bernath had acted under influence from the White House , and that neither man had intended to harm Tripp .
Spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said Cohen considers the matter closed and will take no further action .
Tripp , who secretly recorded conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky , worked for Bacon in the Pentagon 's public affairs office , as did Lewinsky .
Tripp remains a Defense Department employee but works in a public affairs office outside the Pentagon .
Tripp 's secret taping of conversations with Lewinsky gave Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr the starting point for his perjury and obstruction probe of President Clinton that resulted in the president 's impeachment in the House and acquittal in a Senate trial .
Bacon and Bernath were involved in revealing in March 1998 that Tripp stated on a security clearance form she never had been arrested .
In fact , Tripp was arrested for grand larceny as a teen-ager , a charge later reduced to loitering .
Tripp has filed a civil suit against the Defense Department over the release of the information from her personnel records .
Sen. James M. Inhofe , who has called for Bacon 's resignation , denounced Cohen 's response as a `` whitewash and cover-up . ''
`` The law was broken and nothing is being done about it , '' said Inhofe , R - Okla. , adding that Bacon and Bernath should be prosecuted .
The Justice Department in April declined to seek prosecution , saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that Bacon and Bernath knowingly violated the Privacy Act of 1974 .
Tripp 's lawyers , in a statement , accused Bacon of having participated knowingly in a `` public relations smear campaign '' orchestrated by the White House to undermine Tripp 's credibility .
They urged Clinton to overturn Cohen 's action and `` order proper punishment and remedial actions '' against Bacon .
Cohen noted that the IG report found that Bacon should have consulted with the department 's general counsel -- but did not -- before releasing any information about Tripp .
`` The failure to follow established procedures must be considered a serious lapse in judgment , '' Cohen wrote .
Quigley said Cohen chose not to make his letters a part of either Bacon 's or Bernath 's permanent personnel file .
Cohen ordered more training on the Privacy Act for all Pentagon public affairs employees .
