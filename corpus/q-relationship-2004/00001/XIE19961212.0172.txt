WASHINGTON , December 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The year of 1996 is marked by two distinctive characteristics -- the tendency for multipolarization becoming stronger and the United States position as chief of the Western Alliance being challenged .
The United States , which poses as the world leader , has always tried to impose its political will upon others and acted arbitrarily in economic affairs , regardless of the interests of other countries .
With its major rival for world hegemony collapsed at the end of the Cold War , the U.S. , the only superpower today , has become more eager to practice power politics in the world .
The United States has tried more conspicuously to seek hegemonism this year , but at the same time has aroused fiercer resistance to its power politics .
Even its allies have shown increasing independence , and sometimes resistance to the U.S. in international affairs , putting it in an embarrassing position .
At the beginning of this year , Mexico lodged a protest against a U.S. decision to restrict the export of Mexican vegetables to the U.S. , and accused the U.S. of violating the North America Free Trade Agreement .
Later , the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- ruled that a U.S. legislation which restricts Venezuela 's oil exports to the United States violates the principle of free trade and discriminates against foreign products .
At the end of February , the U.S. intensified its sanctions against Cuba for shooting down two U.S. planes that had violated Cuba 's territorial air space .
In March , the U.S. congress passed the Helms - Burton law extending the sanction to all countries that have trade and economic relations with Cuba .
In August , the U.S. congress passed the D 'Amato law to intensify sanctions against Iran and Libya .
Under the law , the U.S. would punish foreign companies investing in the oil and gas industries of the two countries .
The two laws immediately caused strong opposition from allies of the United States .
Canada , in alliance with Latin American countries , passed a resolution at the Ibero - American summit , condemning the Helms - Burton law , the first time in the history of the organization .
The bills were also strongly condemned by U.S. allies in West Europe , such as Germany , Britain and France , which criticized the sanctions as `` absurd and unjustifiable . ''
They warned that if the U.S. continued to go this way , they would adopt `` collective retaliatory measures . ''
The European Union sued the U.S. in the WTO against the law in early October .
And after scrutiny of U.S. trade policies , the WTO made it clear in mid- November that the two sets of legislation were U.S. practised outside its territory , and hence decided to set up an arbitration committee on the `` Helms - Burton '' law .
The United States has long had disputes and wrangles with its allies over their respective economic interests .
The dispute this time , however , is different .
The U.S. passed the two laws not out of consideration of its economic interests , but in an attempt to cut off the economic relations of the three countries with the outside world so as to attain its political and strategic objectives .
It is clear that the United States wanted its allies to sacrifice their economic interests to serve its own political interests , a method that might work during the Cold War period when the U.S. played the role as patron of Western countries .
Western countries nowadays , however , put their national and regional interests first , and are unwilling to sacrifice their own interests to serve the United States as before .
In modern world affairs , developing countries have made more efforts to join forces in opposing hegemony , and more Western countries have begun to make their own decisions independently .
This is particularly obvious in the United Nations affairs this year .
The United States announced in June its objection to the re-election of incumbent Boutros Boutros - Ghali as U.N. secretary-general .
It has not only aroused criticism from developing countries , but also from Britain and France , two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council .
Although the United States threatened time and again to resort to its veto power on the issue , 14 members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council voted in mid- November to support Boutros - Ghali for a second term .
In addition , the U.N. General Assembly this year passed a resolution by 137 to 3 , demanding that the United States lift its three-decade-long blockade against Cuba .
Noteworthily , only the U.S. and two other countries voted against the resolution , while most of its allies stood on the side of developing countries .
That the U.S. was so isolated in the U.N. was something never previously seen in the history of the world body .
Another example of the isolated position of the U.S. in international affairs is its air attacks on Iraq in September .
The attacks prompted strong condemnation from other countries , in particular , from Arabic countries , and received little support from U.S. allies .
It is an inevitable outcome of the development of post- Cold War international affairs that U.S. allies challenge its position as chief of the alliance and demonstrate more independence in handling international affairs .
The U.S. , in maintaining its interests worldwide , pursues `` monolateralism '' and forces its will on others while pushing its global hegemonic policy .
This aggravates its disagreements with developing countries and causes friction and clashes with its allies .
The U.S. has been isolated time and again in international affairs this year , which demonstrates the tendency of faster multipolarization throughout the world .
