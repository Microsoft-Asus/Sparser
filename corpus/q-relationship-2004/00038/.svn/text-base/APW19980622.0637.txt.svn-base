KUCHING , Malaysia
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
South Korea will stand by its commitment to open some key industries to free trade , but wants greater flexibility in the process of doing so , officials said Monday .
South Korean trade minister Han Duck -soo said late Monday that flexibility in free trade was expected to become a key issue in the second day of talks among trade ministers at the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .
`` We are still committed to trade liberalization despite our economic problems , '' Han said .
`` One thing is quite certain . ...
There should be a credible -LRB- trade liberalization -RRB- package arising from this trade meeting , '' he said .
Han emphasized it was important that voluntarism on the part of the 18 member countries was recognized as a crucial principle of APEC .
The two-day meeting on Borneo Island is the first among trade ministers since the APEC summit in Vancouver last November , when APEC members agreed to undertake a fast-track liberalization approach to trade in nine key industries .
The United States is pushing member nations to commit to certain time frames and tariff reductions so that APEC nations can begin to open up those industries by next year .
`` We have made it clear we will participate in the trade liberalization process , '' said Han , though South Korea would ask for flexibility in the fisheries and forestry industries .
In other words , it is not prepared to open up those markets to free trade quite yet .
Korea agrees with some members that APEC should be used as a tool to enhance trade liberalization within the framework of the World Trade Organization .
Han said it was `` natural '' to take any trade liberalization accomplishments within APEC and go to the WTO to enhance the process .
Han said the liberalization of Korea 's steel and automobile sectors was also discussed in bilateral negotiations with the U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky .
He added that the United States was seeking more information about the restructuring of the Korean steel sector and Korea 's plans to open up its automobile market ahead of a likely meeting between the two countries next month .
Han emphasized again that Japan 's falling yen would continue to have a `` dangerous '' impact on Korea 's exports because 50 percent of the country 's shipments compete with the Japanese .
