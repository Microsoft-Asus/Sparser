GENEVA , May 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- A group of Swiss politicians and experts are trying to launch an initiative to hold a nationwide vote on the issue if Switzerland should be a member of the United Nations after Swiss voters rejected UN membership in a referendum in 1986 , according to a news report by the Swiss Radio International on Tuesday .
The group believes that the UN is the only international organization which can play a role in solving conflicts peacefully .
The group said that there was little understanding abroad for Switzerland 's position , since the country is already paying contributions to the organization .
Switzerland is not a UN member but the United Nations Office at Geneva -LRB- UNOG -RRB- and dozens of other UN agencies and international organizations like the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , the International Telecommunications Union -LRB- ITU -RRB- and the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- are based in the western Swiss city of Geneva .
