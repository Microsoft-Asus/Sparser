The discovery and early study of cells progressed with the invention and improvement of microscopes in the 17th century. Microscopes of various types are still indispensable tools for the study of cells.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The microscopes first used by Renaissance scientists, as well as the microscopes you are likely to use in the laboratory, are all <span class="Emphasis2">light microscopes (LMs).</span> Visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses. The lenses refract (bend) the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified as it is projected into the eye, onto photograph film, or onto a video screen. (See the appendix at the back of the book that diagrams microscope structure.)</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Two important parameters in microscopy are magnification and resolving power, or resolution. Magnification in microscopy is the ratio of an object’s image to its real size. <span class="Emphasis2">Resolving power</span> is a measure of the clarity of the image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as two separate points. For example, what appears to the unaided eye as one star in the sky may be resolved as twin stars with a telescope.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Just as the resolving power of the human eye is limited, the resolving power of telescopes and microscopes is limited. Microscopes can be designed to magnify objects as much as desired, but the light microscope can never resolve detail finer than about 0.2 micrometer (<span class="symbol">m</span>m), the size of a small bacterium (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.1</span>). This resolution is limited by the shortest wavelength of light used to illuminate the specimen. Light microscopes can magnify effectively to about 1,000 times the size of the actual specimen; at greater magnifications, the image becomes increasingly blurry. Most of the improvements in light microscopy since the beginning of the 20th century have involved new methods for enhancing contrast, which clarifies the details that can be resolved (TABLE 7.1, p. 110). In addition, scientists have developed methods for labeling particular cell components so that they stand out visually.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-1','../fig/big/fig7-1.jpg','fig7-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-1.jpg" alt="fig7-1" name="myfig7-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The size range of cells.</span> Most cells (yellow region of chart) are between 1 and 100 <span class="symbol">m</span>m in diameter and are therefore visible only under a microscope.

Most subcellular structures, or <span class="Emphasis2">organelles,</span> are too small to be resolved by the light microscope. Cell biology advanced rapidly in the 1950s with the introduction of the electron microscope. Instead of using light, the <span class="Emphasis2">electron microscope (EM)</span> focuses a beam of electrons through the specimen or onto its surface. Resolving power is inversely related to the wavelength of radiation a microscope uses, and electron beams have wavelengths much shorter than the wavelengths of visible light. Modern electron microscopes can theoretically achieve a resolution of about 0.1 nanometer (nm), but the practical limit for biological structures is generally only about 2 nm--still a hundredfold improvement over the light microscope. Biologists use the term <span class="Emphasis1">cell ultrastructure</span> to refer to a cell’s anatomy as revealed by an electron microscope.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">There are two basic types of electron microscopes: the <span class="Emphasis2">transmission electron microscope (TEM)</span> and the <span class="Emphasis2">scanning electron microscope (SEM).</span> Cell biologists use the TEM mainly to study the internal ultrastructure of cells. The TEM aims an electron beam through a thin section of the specimen, similar to the way a light microscope transmits light through a slide. However, instead of using glass lenses, the TEM uses electromagnets as lenses to focus and magnify the image by bending the paths of the electrons. The image is ultimately focused onto a screen for viewing or onto photographic film. To enhance contrast in the image, very thin sections of preserved cells are stained with atoms of heavy metals, which attach to certain cellular structures (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.2a</span>).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig7-2','../fig/big/fig7-2.jpg','fig7-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig7-2.jpg" alt="fig7-2" name="myfig7-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 7-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Electron micrographs.

The electron beam scans the surface of the sample, which is usually coated with a thin film of gold. The beam excites electrons on the sample’s surface, and these secondary electrons are collected and focused onto a screen. The result is an image of the topography of the specimen. The SEM has great depth of field, which results in an image that appears three-dimensional.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText">Electron microscopes reveal many organelles that are impossible to resolve with the light microscope. But the light microscope offers advantages, especially for the study of live cells. A disadvantage of electron microscopy is that the methods used to prepare the specimen kill the cells. Also, these methods may introduce artifacts, structural features seen in micrographs that do not exist in the living cell. (Artifacts can occur in light microscopy, too.)</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">Microscopes are the most important tools of <span class="Emphasis1">cytology,</span> the study of cell structure. But simply describing the diverse organelles within the cell reveals little about their function. Modern cell biology developed from an integration of cytology with <span class="Emphasis1">biochemistry,</span> the study of the molecules and chemical processes of metabolism. A biochemical approach called cell fractionation has been particularly important in cell biology.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
