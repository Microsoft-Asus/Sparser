HUNTSVILLE , Texas --
David Ruiz , the inmate whose name is synonymous with prison reform in Texas , has lived the past 11 years , locked alone in a 6-by-9-foot cell 23 hours a day .
It has given him plenty of time to reflect on conditions behind bars -- conditions he played a key role in changing with the 30-page , handwritten lawsuit he filed in 1972 .
And while much has improved , Ruiz says now , much remains the same , particularly abusive guards and poor medical attention .
Although he was unaware that Senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice recently held three weeks of hearings on prison conditions , Ruiz would be in favor of the judge 's ruling Monday .
The inmate said that he hoped the judge would not abandon the case that triggered both reforms and the largest prison expansion in U.S. history .
`` I used to be bitter and hateful , '' said the 56-year -old convict , his forearms bearing the scars of repeated self-mutilation with razor blades while behind bars .
`` All that is over .
Some years back I made a commitment to God .
I know I made a big change . ''
Ruiz was one of 13 children born in Austin to migrant farm workers .
A fifth-grade dropout who later became one of the state 's most prolific jailhouse lawyers , he has spent the better part of his life in lock-up .
He was first sent to reform school at age 12 .
His first prison sentence came at age 18 when he robbed an Austin store and stole a car .
Paroled , he was soon picked up for robbery again .
Now sentenced to life as a habitual offender , his home is the Estelle Unit , located just outside Huntsville in the tiny community of Riverside .
There , he has been held in administrative segregation -- where he is virtually isolated from all other prisoners -- since he last returned to the Texas prison system in 1988 .
Normally smiling , his eyes dancing and his thoughts spilling out in a rush of words , Ruiz 's demeanor changes when he talks about his solitary lifestyle .
The cadence of his speech slows , the smile disappears .
`` I 'm tired of ad seg , '' he says , his eyes clouding , his voice choking .
`` Can you imagine being in a little room 23 hours a day for 11 years ? ''
The one hour a day he is let out of his cell , he is escorted -- his hands cuffed behind his back -- to a caged recreation yard for 60 minutes of playing basketball , doing chin-ups , walking , jogging or whatever -- all by himself .
`` You walk around and look up at the sky and wish and hope .
Hope for a better tomorrow , '' he said .
`` Very few can feel the effects that being confined -LRB- in isolation -RRB- this long has . ''
Ruiz is in solitary confinement , prison officials say , because his membership in the Mexican Mafia prison gang and his lawsuit make him a target .
Ruiz contends he is not a member of the gang .
As for the `` big change '' he says he has made in prison , Ruiz says he is more tolerant of his keepers .
`` I used to file a grievance on every little thing , but now I do n't , because I know everyone makes mistakes , '' he said while pulling out an accordion file and displaying his latest verbal sparring with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice .
His latest beef is with a correctional officer who placed a long-distance collect phone call to his wife , Rose .
Ruiz was told that the woman who answered refused to accept charges .
He believes the guard either intentionally misdialed or lied to him .
The rejection of the phone call means another 90-day wait before he can try to call his wife again .
`` I know it was done to do , like , mental torture on me , so I would think , ` Why does n't she want to talk to me ? ' ''
Ruiz said .
`` That is cruel .
To a person in the free society , it might not seem like much , but to someone in prison it means a lot . ''
As further proof of his personal transformation , Ruiz says he quit doing drugs 13 years ago .
Yet his `` travel card '' -- a packet of information outlining his medical needs , disciplinary infractions and other detail about his confinement -- indicates he has been disciplined often for possession of drugs and other contraband , as recently as 1997 .
It was during a prison stint in the late ' 60s that Ruiz met a lawyer who helped him draft a challenge to his robbery conviction , and Ruiz the writ-writer was born .
In 1972 , he scrawled the now legendary lawsuit against prison conditions , detailing complaints of extreme crowding , lack of medical care , and abusive and oppressive `` building tenders '' -LRB- inmate guards -RRB- who sometimes raped and killed other prisoners .
He admits that medical care has improved since then , `` but I do n't know how much better .
I ca n't agree with TDCJ that it 's outstanding . ''
He said prisoners with AIDS , tuberculosis and hepatitis suffer the most from inconsistent care , and that some doctors routinely dismiss most prisoners ' health complaints as malingering .
He does not respond , however , to a question of whether prisoners get better medical care than poor people who are not imprisoned .
Although he acknowledges that some prison guards treat offenders respectfully , he contends that others -- particularly young officers from small towns in East Texas `` who come in with a macho attitude -- are still abusive to felons .
Inmates frequently are assaulted by guards even when the prisoners are handcuffed , Ruiz claims .
`` If you 're disliked by some officer , then you 're in danger , '' he said .
Meanwhile , he is challenging his classification in administrative segregation by renouncing membership in the Mexican Mafia -- a gang he insisted at least as far back as 1992 that he had never joined .
But last week , he admitted that he had agreed to be the mafia 's legal adviser during a time when he was in federal prison , where he was housed because of concerns for his safety .
In 1988 , shortly after he was returned to state custody , Ruiz told the Houston Chronicle he feared for his life .
He said another prisoner told him he had been offered $ 25,000 to kill him , and that he had been attacked by a federal prisoner in Terre Haute , Ind .
Now he downplays TDCJ 's insistence that he needs protection from other prisoners , claiming it 's a `` bogus '' assertion .
`` I 've been in danger all my life , '' he said last week .
`` I 'm in danger of being killed every day by some crazy inmate or some officer . ''
