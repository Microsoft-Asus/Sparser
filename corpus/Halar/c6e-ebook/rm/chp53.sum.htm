The interactive hypothesis states that the species within a community are locked into biotic interactions.</p></LI><LI><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models (p. 1176)</span> The rivet model suggests that all the species in a community are linked together in a tight web of interactions, so that the loss of even a single species has strong repercussions for the community. The redundancy model proposes that if a species is lost from a community, other species will fill in the gap.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism (pp. 1176-1181,</span>&nbsp;TABLE 53.1, <span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 53.2</span>-<span class="SmallCap">53.9</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The ecological niche is the sum total of the organism’s use of the biotic and abiotic resources in its environment. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist in the same community if their niches are identical. Predation includes herbivory and parasitism. Predation has led to diverse adaptations in predators and prey, including mimicry. Mutualism refers to symbiotic interactions in which both species benefit. Commensalism refers to symbiotic interactions in which one species benefits and the other is not affected; there are few if any cases of pure commensalism.</p><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity53A:<span class="Emphasis1">
