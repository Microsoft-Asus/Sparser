BEIJING , March 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Hong Kong and interior areas should join efforts to seize opportunities and face challenges brought by the interior 's expected entry into the global trade body , according to Hong Kong members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference -LRB- CPPCC -RRB- .
Members from Hong Kong business circles said during their panel discussions that accession to the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- will not only have great influence for economic development in the inland areas , but also produce favorable conditions for economic growth in Hong Kong .
Upon its entry into the WTO , China will face competitions involving personnel , foreign-financed enterprises and businesses and acute employment pressure , said Luk Chung -lam , adding that Hong Kong should further increase its cooperation with the mainland , taking the advantage of being a long-standing WTO member and other favorable conditions in standing to the challenges .
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -LRB- SAR -RRB- and its business circles are acquainted with international trade rules and WTO regulations .
So it can share such experience with the inland areas , Luk said .
Meanwhile , the interior can pool funds and obtain banking services as well as related technology from Hong Kong , according to Leung Tim -pui .
Moreover , enterprises in Hong Kong , Taiwan and in interior areas can work in cooperation to develop bartering centers in coastal cities of the interior , so that transportation , storage , stock management , packing , and value-added services can be handled in a concentrated way in a bid to lower marketing costs , said Mun Kin -chok , a noted economist from Hong Kong .
