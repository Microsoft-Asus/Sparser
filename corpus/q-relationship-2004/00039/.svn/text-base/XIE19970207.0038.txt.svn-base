TOKYO , February 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today called for the settlement of a long-running dispute with Russia over the Northern Territories , or Kuril Islands .
At today 's national conference in Tokyo marking the annual `` Northern Territories Day '' , Hashimoto said the Northern Territories dispute should be settled under the Tokyo Declaration , signed in 1993 during Russian President Boris Yeltsin 's visit to Japan .
Under the declaration , the two countries agreed to respect history and reality and to reach a peace accord as soon as possible on the basis of the principles of laws and justice .
The islands , respectively Kunashiri , Etorofu , Habomai and Shikotan , are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kurils in Russia .
They were under Japanese control until September 1945 when they were seized by the Soviet Union .
Relations between the two countries have been chilly ever since , as the Soviet Union , and then Russia , have repeatedly turned down Japan 's consistent demands for the return of the islands .
Hashimoto stressed that the full normalization of Japanese - Russian relations is not only of great benefit to the two countries themselves but also to the whole international community .
He vowed to make persistent efforts to find an early solution to the dispute .
The Japanese prime minister said he hoped to establish stable relations with Russia under truly mutual understanding .
Tokyo has signaled recently that it would consider taking part in joint economic development of the islands , which are famous for their fishing resources .
