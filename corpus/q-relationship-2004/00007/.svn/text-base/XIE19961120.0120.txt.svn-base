<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">MANILA , November 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- From Blake Island in the United States to Subic Bay in the Philippines , the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- forum has been moving from vision to action in the past four years to achieve its goal of free and open trade and investment .
Initialed as an informal policy talk shop and a forum for sector specific cooperation projects , APEC consolidated its position as a regional economic force when its first informal leadership conference was held on Blake Island , Seattle , in November 1993</ENAMEX> .
At that meeting , leaders of the 18 APEC members promoted a regional economic vision of a community of Asia Pacific economies where goods , services and capital would flow freely .
The vision was also expected to contribute to an expanding world economy and support an open multilateral trading system .
In November 1994 at Bogor in Indonesia , President Soeharto took the organization a further significant step forward by giving substance to the leaders ' 1993 vision .
The APEC leaders agreed that industrialized economies should achieve free and open trade and investment by 2010 and developing economies by 2020 .
In order to meet the Bogor goal , the APEC member economies decided to focus their attention on three main areas : trade and investment liberalization , trade and investment facilitation measures and economic and technical cooperation .
At the Osaka meeting in November 1995 , Japan coordinated the development of an action agenda for APEC members , which laid out the guidelines , issues and objectives for achieving the free trade goal .
APEC ministers and officials were instructed to begin the preparation of concrete and substantive Individual Action Plans and APEC -wide Collective Action Plans consistent with the Osaka Action Agenda .
The overall implementation of these plans will begin in 1997 .
The Philippines , as chair of APEC meetings in 1996 , has the responsibility for coordinating and supervising the development of these plans .
It will lead efforts of the member economies at the eighth APEC ministerial meetings and the fourth informal leadership conference to be held in the country and will assemble and present a successful and complete Manila Action Plan to the ministers and leaders when they meet in Manila and Subic Bay .
As Philippine President Fidel Ramos said earlier , while the Osaka Action Agenda served as the roadway towards the APEC 's goal of free and open trade and investment , the APEC meeting in Subic Bay on November 25 will give action .
