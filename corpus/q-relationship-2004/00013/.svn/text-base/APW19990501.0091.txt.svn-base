WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- `` Communications breakdowns '' could be the reason a suspected spy for China continued to have top-secret access at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , says Energy Secretary Bill Richardson .
The Taiwan -born scientist , Wen Ho Lee , was fired March 8 over alleged security violations after having been the target of an FBI investigation since 1996 into the alleged theft of nuclear warhead information by China in the 1980s .
Richardson said Friday that Lee should have been denied access to secrets long ago .
`` It seems within the lab , within the Department of Energy there were some communication breakdowns as to why this individual was still pursuing security work of a sensitive nature at a time when there were suspicions about him , '' Richardson said .
Since he was fired , investigators have learned that Lee had transferred nuclear warhead computer codes from the lab 's most secure computer system to his own , unclassified computer used for communicating both within the lab and to the outside .
Appearing on PBS ' `` The News Hour with Jim Lehrer , '' Richardson said an internal investigation is trying to determine if government or lab officials should be disciplined because Lee was not moved sooner and stripped of his top security clearance .
Richardson and other administration officials said when Lee was fired in March that he had been allowed to keep his security clearance and a sensitive job so as not to tip him off about the investigation .
Lee , 59 , had worked at Los Alamos since 1978 .
He has not been charged with any crime and , through his lawyer , he has denied being involved in any espionage .
Richardson said he knew of `` no evidence '' that any of the computer code data had been shipped via e-mail outside the Los Alamos facility in New Mexico but acknowledged it was theoretically possible .
According to Richardson , most of the computer code transfers occurred in 1994-95 but some go back as far as 1983 .
