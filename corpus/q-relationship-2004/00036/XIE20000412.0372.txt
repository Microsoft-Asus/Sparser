WASHINGTON , April 12 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- China , despite its efforts for joining in the World Trade Organization , is strongly opposed to linking its trade status with such issues as cross-strait relations , human rights and arms proliferation , said Li Zhao -xing , Chinese Ambassador to the United States .
`` The agreement on China 's accession to the WTO reached by China and the United States is really a win-win situation .
It is good for both countries .
It is also good for the rest of the world and for the WTO itself , '' Li told a AmCham China Washington Doorknock delegation here in the Chinese embassy on Tuesday .
Ambassador Li said that granting normal trade status with each other should be taken for granted as an obligation among the WTO members , and therefore the United States should in no way regard PNTR as a favor bestowed to China .
China 's entry into the WTO serves the interests of the United States and China .
`` However , America may forgo possible benefits if there is no PNTR -LRB- for China -RRB- , '' Ambassador Li told the 30 delegates from over 20 American enterprises now functioning in China .
The AmCham China delegates , who arrived here in the past few days , have started a week-long uphill battle in lobbying on the Capitol Hill for granting China PNTR .
Ambassador Li pointed out that some Americans here have been trying to link PNTR with such issues as Taiwan , human rights and proliferation .
These things are `` irrelevant '' to China 's trade status , and it is `` groundless '' to mix them up , Li said .
Ambassador Li said that the recent election in Taiwan has neither altered the fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China , nor that Taiwan issue is the internal affair of China which brooks no foreign interference .
He criticized `` a handful of American politicians '' for making use of PNTR to press China into concessions on the Taiwan issue .
'' This is an interference with China 's internal affairs , and the Chinese people will never bow to the pressure , '' he said .
Timothy P. Stratford , Chairman of AmCham China , told Xinhua that China 's entry into the WTO will provide American businesses with a rare chance to further open the largest potential market in the world , and bring about a greater mount of jobs for American workers .
He dismissed any linkage between PNTR and such issues as Taiwan , human rights and proliferation as `` unwise , '' because if the PNTR bill fails to pass Congress , America will not be able to benefit from China 's further opening of its market , and its own national interests will be undermined .
James Patrick Gradoville , VP and Regional Director of Asia/ Pacific Government Relations of Motorola , said , `` we have been talking with members of Congress about the importance of having a clean bill , a bill that does not add any conditions at all to China 's entry into the WTO . ''
Gradoville predicted `` a close vote '' on PNTR in Congress , which is scheduled to take place in the week of May 22 .
`` We have to be confident , '' and `` I think it -LRB- the PNTR bill -RRB- will pass if we work very , very hard , '' he said .
