<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Chemical weapons monitors confirmed Wednesday that Japan has destroyed a factory used by a doomsday cult to make nerve gas used in the 1995 attack on Tokyo 's subway system .
The sarin gas attack , carried out by the shadowy Aum Shinri Kyo cult , killed 12 people and sickened thousands .</ENAMEX>
Investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons oversaw the destruction earlier this month of the high-tech plant at a commune near Mount Fuji .
`` This was a spectacular operation because it is the destruction of a facility which has caused harm and victims , '' said OPCW spokesman Donato Kiniger - Passigli .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">OPCW officials declined to give details of the nature of the machinery and chemicals removed or destroyed by Japanese officials and would not say how much sarin was stored at the plant .
But the organization 's inspectorate director , former Japanese Army officer Ichiro Akiyama , confirmed that the cult 's gas factory was a highly professional operation</ENAMEX> .
`` The technology they are using is quite advanced , '' he said , adding that only about six Japanese Army officers know how to make sarin .
Akiyama said that the Japanese cleanup of the site was so thorough that vegetables could safely be planted there now .
Much of the laboratory and production equipment from the plant in Kamikuishiki , about 140 kilometers -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- southwest of Tokyo , was removed for use as evidence in criminal trials against cult members .
Cultists , including top guru Shoko Asahara , are on trial on charges including the subway gassing as well as other gassings , murders and other crimes .
The OPCW oversees the U.N. -brokered Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons .
