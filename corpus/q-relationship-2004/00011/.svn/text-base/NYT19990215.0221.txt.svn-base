HOUSTON --
In what could be a trendsetting move for the petroleum industry , Shell Oil Co. is moving from the gas pump to the gas meter , beginning in Georgia .
Shell and the rest of the oil patch may be reeling from a collapse in crude oil prices that has made a gallon of Coca - Cola twice as expensive as a gallon of gasoline .
But the U.S. operating company for the Royal Dutch/Shell Group reports positive results from marketing natural gas in Georgia after four months .
Alan Raymond , president of Shell Energy Services , said the sales model and infrastructure established for Georgia will be carried over to other states .
`` One could not afford to do this business just for the state of Georgia , '' Raymond said .
`` We see this as a national business .
As states restructure , we 'll be there . ''
Shell last week was certified to market both natural gas and electricity in Pennsylvania .
Raymond added that New York , New Jersey , Michigan , Ohio and Texas `` are all on our radar screen . ''
Shell is rolling out its Georgia marketing effort with limited local on-the-ground presence .
The nerve center is a suite of offices in downtown Houston , one block from the pink granite corporate headquarters at One Shell Plaza .
The call center for natural gas sales and customer service is at a Syracuse , N.Y. , telemarketing company .
The company 's one full-time employee in Georgia , sales manager Timothy Sheehan , works out an office in his northwest Atlanta home .
`` You do n't need to be in Atlanta , or the United States for that matter , '' Raymond said .
`` The more economically we can run the business , the lower costs and savings there will be for customers . ''
Under Georgia 's deregulation law , Atlanta Gas Light Co. will continue to be responsible for delivering gas to homes and businesses , reading meters and repairing leaks .
South Carolina -based SCANA Energy , the early market leader , and Georgia Natural Gas Services , AGL 's marketing affiliate , boast strong local presences .
But Raymond said Shell 's assets include its brand recognition , longtime experience with energy and attention to customer service .
Shell 's yellow pectin symbol is one of the world 's best-known logos , right up there with Coke and the Olympic rings .
More than 12 million Americans fill up each year at Shell 's 9,300 service stations , including 350 in Georgia .
Shell Energy can also count on the parent company 's huge natural gas reserves , wholesale gas and electricity trading operation , and interstate pipeline company .
For example , Ram/Powell , Shell 's $ 1 billion offshore oil and natural gas platform 125 miles southeast of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico , produces enough natural gas to meet the needs of AGL 's customers .
Ram/Powell is just one of 11 deep-water offshore platforms operated by Shell in the gulf .
Then there 's the more than 8 billion cubic feet of gas traded daily by Shell 's Coral Energy subsidiary , one of the top U.S. wholesale gas trading operations .
That 's enough for 34 million homes .
Shell purchases supplies from its affiliates at market rates with no discounts .
But executives say the market gained from their `` seamless '' proximity to Coral Energy is invaluable .
Shell Energy ` s offices are next door to Coral 's 24-hour-a-day energy commodities trading floor .
`` We can walk across the hall and they wo n't feel we are spying on them , '' said Phyllis Borque , Shell Energy 's vice president/operations .
Energy marketing is small potatoes in the grand scheme of the 97-year -old global Shell enterprise , with headquarters in London and The Hague in the Netherlands .
But it may be one of the few bright spots in an industry that is reeling from a collapse of oil prices to $ 12-a-barrel lows not seen since the Great Depression .
To cope , mergers have been announced to join British Petroleum PLC and Amoco Corp. , and Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. Royal Dutch/Shell Group , which last week announced $ 3.6 billion in fourth-quarter losses , is selling a large chunk of its chemical businesses , forming a marketing alliance with Texaco and eliminating thousands of jobs .
Texaco and Amoco have announced plans to get into energy marketing but bypassed Georgia , and Raymond said he has seen `` no evidence of their participation '' around the country .
`` I 'll bet the other oil companies are watching very carefully what happens to Shell here , '' said Walter M. Higgins , chief executive officer of AGL Resources Inc. , parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co. , which has been a major Shell wholesale customer for years .
Shell , which had steered clear of utility businesses because of the regulation that has always come with them , started Shell Energy Services a year ago to take advantage of the start of deregulation of the nation 's $ 300 billion-a-year utility industry .
`` People in London know about it .
It is very important in terms of where the Shell group is going on a global basis , '' said Walter van de Vijver , president of Shell Exploration & Production Co. , which oversees the marketing venture .
He said Shell would not have gotten into the business unless it was clear it could generate $ 100 million in annual sales .
`` If we play it right , it can be a very profitable business , '' van de Vijver said .
Shell declines to release Georgia sales figures , but says customer sales are exceeding expectations after four months .
The company offers a pricing plan that features guaranteed rates for one year .
Danato Eassey , Houston -based energy industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities , said Shell should be able to realize a `` tremendous economy of scale '' by entering utility retail energy sales .
But , he said , Shell may have to wait as the industry is deregulated at a `` glacial pace . ''
Shell 's commercial customers in Georgia include McDonalds , Kroger supermarkets , the Cobb County schools system and endorsements from the Georgia Textile Manufacturers Association and Building Owners and Managers of Atlanta .
The company is also making a push for residential customers .
To profitably market both gas and electricity , Shell will need to add electricity generation , van de Vijver said .
Shell has looked at power plants being sold off by deregulating electric utilities and may build its own natural gas-fired power plants but has no interest in acquiring a regulated utility , executives say .
`` The world is changing , and if you do n't adjust , you 're not going to be there , '' said van de Vijver .
