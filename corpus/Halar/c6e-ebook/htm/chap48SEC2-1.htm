Integration is the process by which the input is interpreted and associated with appropriate responses of the body. The circular arrow in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 48.1</span> indicates that integration is a continuous background activity. For the most part, integration is carried out in the <span class="Emphasis2">central nervous system (CNS),</span> which consists of the brain and spinal cord in vertebrates. <span class="Emphasis2">Motor output</span> is the conduction of signals from the integration center, the CNS, to <span class="Emphasis2">effector cells,</span> the muscle cells or gland cells that actually carry out the body’s responses to stimuli. The signals are conducted by <span class="Emphasis2">nerves,</span> ropelike bundles of extensions of neurons tightly wrapped in connective tissue. The nerves that communicate motor and sensory signals between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are collectively called the <span class="Emphasis2">peripheral nervous system (PNS).</span> From receptor to effector, information is communicated along a pathway of neurons by a combination of electrical and chemical signals. In this chapter we concentrate on communication within the nervous system. Chapter 49 connects the nervous system to its inputs and outputs by discussing sensory receptors and the physiology of movement.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig48-1','../fig/big/fig48-1.jpg','fig48-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig48-1.jpg" alt="fig48-1" name="myfig48-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 48-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Overview of a vertebrate nervous system.</span> Integration of sensory input and motor output is not usually rigid and linear, but involves the continuous background activity symbolized by the brain’s cyclical arrow in this diagram.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
