In <span class="Emphasis2">asexual reproduction,</span> a single individual is the sole parent and passes copies of all its genes to its offspring. For example, single-celled eukaryotic organisms can reproduce asexually by mitotic cell division, in which DNA is copied and allocated equally to two daughter cells. The genomes of the offspring are virtually exact copies of the parent’s genome. Some multicellular organisms are also capable of reproducing asexually. <span class="Emphasis1">Hydra,</span> a relative of the jellyfishes, can reproduce by budding (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.1</span>). Because the cells of the bud were derived by mitosis in the parent, the "chip off the old block" is usually genetically identical to its parent. Occasional genetic differences are due to relatively rare changes in the DNA called mutations, which we will discuss in Chapter 17. An individual that reproduces asexually gives rise to a <span class="Emphasis2">clone,</span> a group of genetically identical individuals.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig13-1','../fig/big/fig13-1.jpg','fig13-1');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig13-1.jpg" alt="fig13-1" name="myfig13-1"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 13-1.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The asexual reproduction of a hydra.</span> This relatively simple multicellular animal reproduces by budding.

In contrast to a clone, offspring of sexual reproduction vary genetically from their siblings and both parents: "Like begets like" only in the general sense of family resemblance. Genetic variation like that shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 13.2</span> (p. 236) is an important consequence of sexual reproduction. What mechanisms generate this genetic variation? The key is the behavior of chromosomes during the sexual life cycle.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig13-2','../fig/big/fig13-2.jpg','fig13-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig13-2.jpg" alt="fig13-2" name="myfig13-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 13-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Two families.</span> Two sets of parents make up the top row.
