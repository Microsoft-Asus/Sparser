HANOI , May 9 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Vietnam 's capital city Hanoi is trying to double its gross domestic product -LRB- gdp -RRB- to 1,100 U.S. dollars per capita over the next five years , according to a political report delivered at Hanoi Communist Party Congress .
The Party Congress of Hanoi opened Tuesday with Vietnam 's Communist Party leader Do Muoi and other senior leaders being present .
Hanoi 's average gdp in 1995 was estimated at 650 U.S. dollars per capita compared with 470 U.S. dollars in 1991 .
The sharp rise was due to massive investments from both foreign and domestic sources estimated at 32,570 billion vnd -LRB- about 3.25 billion U.S. dollars -RRB- , according to the report .
The report said that by the end of 1995 , up to 210 foreign investment projects had been licensed to operate in Hanoi involving 3.3 billion U.S. dollars of prescribed capital .
Of this amount 1.3 billion U.S. dollars has been consumed .
This has helped Hanoi along its chosen path to restructure its economic base towards industries and services rather than rely on its traditional agriculture and small industry .
The proportion of industries and that of trade and services in Hanoi 's gdp in the 1991-95 period rose sharply to 33.1 per cent and 61.6 per cent respectively .
Meanwhile the agricultural share fell to just 5.3 per cent of the total gdp share .
In the next five years , Hanoi would need 9 billion U.S. dollars in investment to develop new industrial zones , renovate existing industrial zones and build more high rise buildings in the inner city for office space , trade centres and entertainment centres .
