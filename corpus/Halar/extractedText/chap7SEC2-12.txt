 Peroxisomes generate and degrade H2O2 in performing various metabolic functions

The peroxisome is a specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane (FIGURE 7.19). Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transfer hydrogen from various substrates to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product, from which the organelle derives its name. These reactions may have many different functions. Some peroxisomes use oxygen to break fatty acids down into smaller molecules that can then be transported to mitochondria as fuel for cellular respiration. Peroxisomes in the liver detoxify alcohol and other harmful compounds by transferring hydrogen from the poisons to oxygen. The H2O2 formed by peroxisome metabolism is itself toxic, but the organelle contains an enzyme that converts the H2O2 to water. Enclosing in the same space both the enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide and those that dispose of this toxic compound is another example of how the cell's compartmental structure is crucial to its functions.

Fig 7-19. Peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are roughly spherical and often have a granular or crystalline core that is probably a dense collection of enzyme molecules. This peroxisome is in a leaf cell. Notice its proximity to two chloroplasts and a mitochondrion. These organelles cooperate with peroxisomes in certain metabolic functions (TEM).

Specialized peroxisomes called glyoxysomes are found in the fat-storing tissues of plant seeds. These organelles contain enzymes that initiate the conversion of fatty acids to sugar, which the emerging seedling can use as an energy and carbon source until it is able to produce its own sugar by photosynthesis.

Unlike lysosomes, peroxisomes do not bud from the endomembrane system. They grow by incorporating proteins and lipids made in the cytosol, and they increase in number by splitting in two when they reach a certain size.
