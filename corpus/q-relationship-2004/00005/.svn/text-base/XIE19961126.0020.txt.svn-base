PARIS , November 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- French President Jacques Chirac today expressed his support to the efforts being made by his Sri Lankan counterpart Chandrika Kumaratunga in seeking a political settlement to the 24-year war with the Tamil Tiger guerrillas .
During his talks with Kumaratunga today , Chirac said that France was closely watching the development in Sri Lanka , because the island nation was the `` entry gate '' to India and Pakistan for French business .
Heavy security was arranged by the French government for Kumaratunga 's three-day visit , her first since she took office in November 1994 , as there is a big Tamil community living in France .
Chirac also expressed his admiration for the perseverance of the Sri Lankan president in solving the `` difficult interior conflict '' in her country .
At least 50,000 people have been killed in the civil war in Sri Lanka since the Tamil Tiger guerrillas revolted against the government in 1972 in the east of the island .
A group of donor countries agreed on November 18 in Paris to provide 860 million U.S. dollars of aid to Sri Lanka in 1997 , while calling on Colombo to accelerate the peace process with the Tigers .
Kumaratunga also raised the issue of the strong presence of the Tamil Tiger supporters in France , during a meeting with French Interior Minister Jean - Louis Debre today .
Two leaders of the the Tamil Tigers group were assassinated in late October in Paris .
The separatist group held the Sri Lankan government responsible for the assassination .
The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry denied the accusation , saying that the killing resulted from an infighting among the separatists over financial disputes .
The Sri Lankan government has launched an extensive diplomatic offensive to prevent the Tamil Tigers from raising fund for its fight for independence in some 40 countries .
