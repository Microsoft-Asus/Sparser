SHENZHEN , November 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Yang Fukun , director of the Legislative Bureau of the Central Military Commission , said here today the law on stationing troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -LRB- SAR -RRB- mainly lists stipulations on a number of issues of principle , and that it cannot be all-inclusive .
Based on China 's constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR , the new law will also serve as a bridge between the national laws and the Hong Kong laws , he added .
Yang listened to opinions of the delegates from the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association on the draft law on stationing troops in Hong Kong , and said the People 's Liberation Army -LRB- PLA -RRB- troops sent by the central people 's government to Hong Kong are for defense purposes , and are essentially different from the British troops stationed there , in terms of both their general nature and duties .
As the PLA troops will be confronted by a society that is different from that of the inland and abides by different laws , it is necessary to formulate a new law to handle some principles , he noted .
Yang said the Basic Law has made principled stipulations on the troops stationed in Hong Kong , pointing out that the draft law on stationing troops in Hong Kong has given more detailed stipulations , based on the Basic Law , while taking into consideration the troops ' obligations .
But it is impossible for the draft law to cover everything , he said .
