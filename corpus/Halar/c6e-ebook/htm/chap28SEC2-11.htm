Alveolates have small membrane-bounded cavities (alveoli) under their cell surfaces. The function of the alveoli is unknown; they may help stabilize the cell surface and regulate the cell’s water and ion content.</p><p class="Header3">Dinoflagellata (Dinoflagellates)</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Dinoflagellates</span> are abundant components of the vast aquatic pastures of phytoplankton that are suspended near the water surface and provide the foundation of most marine and many freshwater food webs.

These blooms are brownish red or pinkish orange because of the predominant pigments (xanthophylls) in the plastids of dinoflagellates. Toxins produced by some red-tide organisms have resulted in massive invertebrate and fish kills and can be deadly to humans as well.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">One especially dangerous dinoflagellate called <span class="Emphasis1">Pfiesteria piscicida</span> is actually carnivorous. During blooms, its toxin stuns fish, and the dinoflagellates feed on their prey’s body fluids. In the past decade, the frequency of <span class="Emphasis1">Pfiesteria</span> blooms and fish kills have increased in coastal waters of the U.S. mid-Atlantic states, possibly a result of pollution of the water with fertilizers (nitrates and phosphates).</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Some dinoflagellates are spectacularly bioluminescent. An ATP-driven chemical reaction gives off light, creating an eerie ocean glow at night when waves, boats, or human swimmers agitate water containing dense populations of the dinoflagellates. A possible function of the bioluminescence: When the surrounding water is agitated by small predators that feed on phytoplankton, the light emitted by the dinoflagellates attracts fish that eat those smaller predators. How would you test this hypothesis?</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Some dinoflagellates live as mutualistic symbionts of animals called cnidarians that build coral reefs; the photosynthetic output of these dinoflagellates is the main food source for reef communities.</p><p class="Header3">Apicomplexa (Apicomplexans)</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">All <span class="Emphasis2">apicomplexans</span> are parasites of animals. Some cause serious human diseases. The parasites disseminate as tiny infectious cells called <span class="Emphasis2">sporozoites.</span> As seen with the electron microscope, one end (the <span class="Emphasis1">apex</span>) of the sporozoite cell contains a <span class="Emphasis1">complex</span> of organelles specialized for penetrating host cells and tissues; thus the name Apicomplexa. Most apicomplexans have intricate life cycles with both sexual and asexual stages, and these cycles often require two or more different host species for completion. An example is <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span>, the parasite that causes malaria (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.13</span>). The incidence of malaria was greatly diminished in the 1960s by the use of insecticides that reduced populations of <span class="Emphasis1">Anopheles</span> mosquitoes, which spread the disease, and by drugs that killed the parasites in humans. However, the multiplication of resistant varieties of both the mosquitoes and the <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span> species have caused a resurgence of the disease. About 300 million people are now infected in the tropics, and up to 2 million die each year from the disease.</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Considerable research on possible malarial vaccines has been carried out, but with little success. <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span> is an extremely evasive parasite. It spends most of its time inside human liver and blood cells, hiding from the host’s immune system. The problem is compounded by changes in the surface proteins of <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span>; the parasite continually changes the "face" that it shows to the infected person’s immune system. Recent identification of a gene that seems to confer resistance to chloroquine, an important antimalarial drug, may lead to ways of blocking drug resistance in <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span>. Another recent discovery has exciting evolutionary and medical implications. A team of molecular biologists led by Sabine Kohler, at the University of Pennsylvania, found that <span class="Emphasis1">Plasmodium</span> and several other apicomplexans contain a plastid, now nonphotosynthetic, that an apicomplexan ancestor probably acquired from a green alga by secondary endosymbiosis. Once researchers discover the critical functions the plastids perform for their host cells, it may be possible to develop new antimalarial drugs that target those functions.</p><p class="Header3">Ciliophora (Ciliates)</p><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">This diverse group of protists is named for their use of cilia to move and feed (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.14</span>). Most <span class="Emphasis2">ciliates</span> live as solitary cells in fresh water. In contrast to most flagella, cilia are relatively short. They are associated with a submembrane system of microtubules that may coordinate the movement of the thousands of cilia.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-14','../fig/big/fig28-14.jpg','fig28-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-14.jpg" alt="fig28-14" name="myfig28-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Ciliates</span> (all LMs).</span></td></tr></table><a name="para11"></a><p class="BlockText">Some ciliates are completely covered by rows of cilia, whereas others have their cilia clustered into fewer rows or tufts. The specific arrangements adapt the ciliates for their diverse lifestyles. Some species, for instance, scurry about on leglike structures constructed from many cilia bonded together. Other forms, such as <span class="Emphasis1">Stentor</span>, have rows of tightly packed cilia that function collectively as locomotor membranelles. Ciliates are among the most complex of all cells.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">A unique feature of ciliate genetics is the presence of two types of nuclei, a large macronucleus and usually several tiny micronuclei. The macronucleus has 50 or more copies of the genome. The genes are not distributed in typical chromosomes but are instead packaged into a much larger number of small units, each with hundreds of copies of just a few genes. The macronucleus controls the everyday functions of the cell by synthesizing RNA and is also necessary for asexual reproduction. Ciliates generally reproduce by binary fission, during which the macronucleus elongates and splits, rather than undergoing mitotic division. Some species of <span class="Emphasis1">Paramecium</span> have from 1 to as many as 80 micronuclei, which do not function in growth, maintenance, and asexual reproduction of the cell but are required for sexual processes that generate genetic variation. The sexual shuffling of genes occurs during the process known as <span class="Emphasis2">conjugation</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.15</span>). Notice in the diagram that in ciliates, sexual mechanisms of meiosis and syngamy are processes separate from reproduction.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-15','../fig/big/fig28-15.jpg','fig28-15');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-15.jpg" alt="fig28-15" name="myfig28-15"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-15.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Conjugation and genetic recombination in <span class="Emphasis1">Paramecium caudatum</span>.</span></span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
