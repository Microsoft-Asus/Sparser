									<a name="para83"></a><p class="BlockText">Over the past half century, there has been a trend in the United States and other developed countries for people to marry and start families later in life than did their parents and grandparents. Speculate on the effects this trend may have on the incidence (frequency) of late-acting dominant lethal alleles in the population.</p>

									<a name="para84"></a><p class="BlockText">You are handed a "mystery" pea plant with long stems and axial flowers, and asked to determine its genotype as quickly as possible. You know the allele for long stems (<span class="Emphasis1">L</span>) is dominant to that for dwarf stems (<span class="Emphasis1">l</span>) and that the allele for axial flowers (<span class="Emphasis1">A</span>) is dominant to that for terminal flowers (<span class="Emphasis1">a</span>).</p><a name="para85"></a><p class="BlockText">a. What are <span class="Emphasis1">all</span> the possible genotypes for your mystery plant?</p><a name="para86"></a><p class="BlockText">b. Describe the <span class="Emphasis1">one</span> cross you would do, out in your garden, to determine the exact genotype of your mystery plant.</p><a name="para87"></a><p class="BlockText">c. While you are waiting for the results of your cross, you go back inside and sit at your desk. You make a separate prediction of results for each possible genotype listed in part a. How do you do this?</p><a name="para88"></a><p class="BlockText">d. Make these predictions, using the following format: "If the genotype of my mystery plant is <u>&#160;&#160;</u><u>&#160;&#160;</u><u>&#160;&#160;</u>, the plants resulting from my cross will be <u>&#160;&#160;</u><u>&#160;&#160;</u><u>&#160;&#160;</u>."</p><a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">e. If 1/2 of your offspring plants have long stems with axial flowers and 1/2 have long stems with terminal flowers, what must be the genotype of your mystery plant?</p><a name="para90"></a><p class="BlockText">f. Explain why the activities you performed in parts c and d were not "doing a cross."</p><a name="para91"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Act as a research physician and medical sleuth to investigate a patient’s condition in the Case Study in the Process of Science, available on the website and CD-ROM.</span></p>

There is no cure for Huntington’s. Would you want to be tested for the Huntington’s allele? Why or why not?</p>
