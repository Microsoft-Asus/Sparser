WASHINGTON , D.C. --
The explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800 could have been triggered by less energy than is produced by the static discharge of a person 's finger touching a metal doorknob .
That surprising discovery was one of many that came from hundreds of tests and countless hours of investigation over the past four years into the crash that killed all 230 people on the Paris -bound Boeing 747 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Taken together , the many findings led investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board to say here Tuesday that the likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit in the jet 's aging wiring .</ENAMEX>
An electrical surge likely found its way into low-voltage fuel-indicator wiring in the center fuel tank , which ignited vapors that had reached explosive levels as the jumbo jet sat on the ground at Kennedy Airport before taking off for Paris , the board was told during the first day of a two-day meeting that will cap the most expensive , extensive and complex air crash investigation in the board 's 33-year history .
`` The bottom line is that our investigation confirmed that the fuel-air vapor in the center wing tank was flammable at the time of the accident , and that a fuel-air explosion with Jet A fuel was more than capable of generating the pressure needed to break apart the center wing tank and destroy the airplane , '' said Dr. Bernard Loeb , head of the NTSB 's office of aviation safety .
The five-member board will issue its final report on the probable cause of the crash Wednesday , along with its recommendations on what needs to be done to make sure what happened to TWA Flight 800 does not happen again .
Much more needs to be done to reduce vapors in fuel tanks that can be ignited more easily than once thought , the board was told .
Jetliners are probably flying 30 percent of the time with fuel tank vapors that could potentially ignite given the right set of conditions , according to research by the Federal Aviation Administration .
Since the dawn of the jet age , and even before , the aviation industry 's fuel tank design philosophy , including The Boeing Co. 's , has been to eliminate all possible fuel tank ignition sources .
Loeb said that approach is not good enough .
`` We concluded that this approach is seriously flawed because experience has demonstrated that all possible ignition sources cannot be reliably eliminated , '' Loeb said .
`` ...
It is not rational to believe that we can predict all possible ignition sources .
Therefore , the most effective approach to preventing fuel tank explosions is to eliminate flammable vapors inside fuel tanks in addition to attempting to eliminate ignition sources . ''
The FAA is looking into the feasibility of a ground -based system that would pump inert nitrogen gas into a jet 's fuel tanks as the best way to prevent future fuel tank explosions .
TWA Flight 800 exploded and fell into the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Long Island some 11 minutes after taking off the evening of July 17 , 1996 .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">At the start of Tuesday 's meeting to hear the staff 's report of the crash , the board 's chairman strongly ruled out theories that a bomb or missile caused the explosion .</ENAMEX>
`` Had we found such evidence , we would have immediately referred the matter back to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for their action , '' Chairman Jim Hall said .
`` Let me state unequivocally , the safety board found no such evidence . ''
About 70 family members of those who died on Flight 800 attended the hearing , including several who came from France .
Hall described the crash as a `` tragic event that stirred strong feelings and emotions throughout the country and throughout the world . ''
The chairman acknowledged that early on it was easy for people to believe that the crash was caused by a criminal act .
`` For many , the events of the times -- the ongoing court trials in the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombings in New York and the heightened concerns about terrorism at the 1996 Olympic games in Atlanta -- seemed to lend a certain credence to the notion , '' he said .
`` Certainly , the very nature of the event and its rarity led some to question whether the crash of Flight 800 was really an accident . ''
Hall was especially critical of those who have continued to charge that the NTSB and other government agencies are involved in a massive coverup .
`` It is unfortunate that a small number of people , pursuing their own agendas , have persisted in making unfounded charges of a government coverup of this investigation , '' Hall said .
`` These people do a grievous injustice to many dedicated individuals , civilian and military , who have been involved in this investigation . ''
That investigation , he said , has uncovered and focused attention on some important safety issues , including fuel tank protection , the vulnerability of aircraft wiring and aging aircraft .
Loeb said investigators looked at numerous possible scenarios for what caused the fuel vapors in the center tank to explode , including a short circuit of a fuel pump , a bomb , a missile fragment and even a meteorite .
All of the theories were considered unlikely , except for one , he said .
`` One ignition scenario that we could not deem unlikely ... was that a short circuit involving electrical wiring outside the center wing tank somehow transferred excess voltage to fuel quantity indication system wiring leading to the center wing tank , '' he said `` Although the voltage in the fuel quantity indication system wiring is limited by design to a very low level , a short circuit from higher voltage wires could allow excessive voltage to be transferred to fuel quantity indication system wires and enter the tank . ''
But he acknowledged that `` we cannot be certain that this in fact occurred , but of all of the ignition scenarios that we considered , this scenario is the most likely . ''
Added Robert Swaim of the board 's aviation engineering division : `` I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of wire and say , ` Here it is . '
'' But investigators never found that piece of the puzzle .
