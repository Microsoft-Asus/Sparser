WASHINGTON , September 24 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United States is inclined to consider South Korea 's call for a resumption of joint Team Spirit military maneuvers , U.S. officials said on Tuesday .
The U.S. officials ' remarks came as the South Korean Defense Ministry issued a statement , saying : `` We plan to strongly propose to the U.S. side resuming the joint Team Spirit exercises as soon as possible . ''
`` This is an issue that is the subject of consultations between the United States and South Korea .
Our inclination is to talk to the South Koreans about this and see where they stand , '' State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said at a briefing .
Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has said that one of its submarines carrying 26 crew ran aground off South Korea on an routine mission last week and demanded South Korea to return the submarine .
But South Korea , seeing it as a spy submarine and the crewmen as infiltrators , called the incident `` deliberate military provocation '' and urged the United States to resume the military exercises , which has not been held since 1993 as a result of easing tension at the Korean Peninsula .
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his South Korean counterpart Gong Ro -mung were expected to discuss the issue during a meeting at the United Nations , the officials said .
Meanwhile , South Korean President Kim Young - Sam is considering a review of his country 's policy toward Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
He has told a group of Japanese newspaper editors in an interview that he is `` seriously considering reviewing our policy toward North Korea '' .
The statements from Washington and Seoul as well as Kim Young - Sam 's remarks could signal a significant escalation of tension at the peninsula , political analysts said .
The U.S. officials said they are still interested in pursuing a proposal for Seoul and Pyongyang to negotiate a formal end to their war more than 40 years ago .
The United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea .
