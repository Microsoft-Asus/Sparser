Russia 's control systems for nuclear weapons are just as reliable as those in the United States , the head of the U.S. Strategic command said Saturday .
Gen. Eugene Habinger , following an inspection tour of weapons sites and storage facilities , said Russia 's strategic forces were capable of protecting nuclear facilities and preventing any unsanctioned use of the weapons , the ITAR - Tass and Interfax news agencies reported .
`` Despite the difference in approach , Washington and Moscow have a common goal : to guarantee the impossibility of any unsanctioned actions , '' Interfax quoted Harbinger as saying .
Harbinger called for the speedy ratification of the START -2 arms limitation treaty by Russia 's parliament , saying ratification would be in the best interests of both countries .
Commenting on the recent nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan , Harbinger said the two countries would need at least three years to move from testing to fully deployment of nuclear weapons systems .
During his stay , Harbinger visited a base for SS -19 rockets at Kozelsk , a strategic bomber base in Engels and a missile complex in Irkutsk .
On Saturday , he and Vladimir Yakovlev , commander of Russia 's strategic forces , flew to the northern port of Murmansk to visit a nuclear submarine base .
