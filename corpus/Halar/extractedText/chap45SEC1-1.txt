AN INTRODUCTION TO REGULATORY SYSTEMS

 

 The endocrine system and the nervous system are structurally, chemically, and functionally related



 

 Invertebrate regulatory systems clearly illustrate endocrine and nervous system interactions



Animals have two systems of internal communication and regulation, the nervous system and the endocrine system. The nervous system, which we will study in Chapters 48 and 49, conveys high-speed signals along specialized cells called neurons. These rapid messages function in such activities as the movement of body parts in response to sudden environmental changes--jerking your hand away from a flame, for example.

Slower means of communication regulate other biological processes, such as the maturation of a butterfly. Different parts of the body must be informed how fast to grow and when to develop the characteristics that distinguish male from female or the juvenile from the adult of a species. This kind of information is often relayed by hormones.

Collectively, all of an animal's hormone-secreting cells constitute the endocrine system. Hormone-secreting organs are called endocrine glands, also called ductless glands because they secrete their chemical messengers directly into body fluids. In contrast, exocrine glands secrete chemicals, such as sweat, mucus, and digestive enzymes, into ducts that convey the products to the appropriate locations.

Although it is convenient to distinguish between the endocrine and nervous systems, the lines between these two regulatory systems are blurred, and homeostasis depends heavily on overlap between them.
