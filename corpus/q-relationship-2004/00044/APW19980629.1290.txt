Stepping up efforts to ease strained relations with Nigeria 's military regime , U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan has arrived for talks with the country 's new leader and opposition activists .
Annan met Monday with Nigerian -born Emeka Anyaoku , the secretary-general of the Commonwealth , who was also in his home country for talks with Nigerian leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar .
The two are expected to meet Abubakar on Tuesday morning , government spokesman David Attah said .
Annan and Anyaoku are the highest-profile international diplomats to visit Nigeria since the late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provoked widespread outrage by executing leading playwright and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa in November 1995 .
Annan plans to meet several pro-democracy leaders , government officials and opposition activists , said Ahmad Fawzi , a member of Annan 's delegation .
Annan was encouraged by the `` rapid steps '' taken by the Nigerian general to `` affirm a transition to democratic and civilian rule , '' Fawzi said .
`` He hopes that all Nigerians will work together in a spirit of cooperation to ensure democracy .
It will require ... flexibility and wisdom , and he trusts these qualities will not be lacking , '' the U.N. official said .
Abubakar has raised expectations for democratic reforms by releasing more than 40 political prisoners .
The country 's most prominent detainee , the presumed winner of the presidential 1993 election , Moshood Abiola , remains behind bars , however .
Abacha , who took power following a coup in 1993 , annulled the results of the election .
He died of heart failure on June 8 and was succeeded by Abubakar .
Anyaoku was also upbeat about the prospects for returning Nigeria to the international fold after years of being a pariah under Abacha .
`` My being here is the beginning of the process of reintegrating Nigeria into the international community , '' Anyaoku told reporters after arriving late Sunday .
`` The whole Commonwealth and the international community has welcomed the steps so far taken by the new leader and our hope is that this is just the beginning . ''
The Commonwealth , a 54-nation organization comprising Britain and its former colonies , suspended Nigeria from its ranks after Saro - Wiwa was executed .
