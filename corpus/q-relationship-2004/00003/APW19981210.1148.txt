<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Protestant David Trimble , in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic John Hume</ENAMEX> , said Thursday that Northern Ireland 's militants must lay down their arms to fulfill a dream of peace on the troubled island .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble , 54 , and Hume , 61 , won the coveted prize for helping to bring about an April peace accord , now called the Good Friday Agreement .</ENAMEX>
They hope to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` We do have a peace today in Ireland .
But it is still something of an armed peace , '' said Trimble , the leader of Northern Ireland 's largest Protestant party , the Ulster Unionist Party .</ENAMEX>
At a gala ceremony at the Oslo City Hall , where 4,000 children had gathered outside in a parade for the laureates , both men vowed to see the peace process through , despite what could be a rough future .
After accepting their awards , which include gold medals , diplomas and a shared 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 943 million -RRB- , both laureates vowed before a crowd of 1,000 to carry out the peace process .
Later in evening , hundreds of Norwegians honored them with a torch-light parade .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">`` We shall overcome , '' said longtime peace activist Hume </ENAMEX>, quoting an earlier Nobel Peace laureate , slain American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume leads the Social Democratic and Labor Party , Northern Ireland 's largest Roman Catholic party .</ENAMEX>
One of the first things they must overcome is a rising crisis in the peace process .
The outlawed Irish Republican Army , nearly 17 months into a truce , is insisting that it wo n't destroy any of its secret stockpiles of weaponry , a goal contained in the accord .
Trimble 's party last week demanded at least a symbolic disarmament before the IRA 's political ally , Sinn Fein , can join a new government body set up under the accords .
`` I have not insisted on precise dates , quantities and manner of decommissioning .
All I have asked for is a credible beginning .
All I have asked for is that they say the so-called ` war ' is over , '' said Trimble in his Nobel speech .
`` A further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking from the clear stream of democracy , or is still drinking from the dark stream of fascism , '' he added .
In his acceptance speech , Hume said they owed it to the people of Ireland to succeed because `` too many lives have already been lost . ''
`` I want to see our Ireland -- North and South -- ... as an example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by living for ideals , rather than fighting or dying for them , '' he said .
Although many were involved in the process that led up to the peace accord -- including British Prime Minister Tony Blair , his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and U.S. President Clinton -- the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee deemed Hume and Trimble as the key players .
`` The circle of violence is broken , '' said committee chairman Francis Sejersted .
`` We know that difficult tasks remain .
Our comfort is that you will continue to lead the peace process . ''
The Nobel committee has often used the prize to nurture difficult , ongoing peace processes .
This is the second time it has tried in Northern Ireland .
The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan for founding a mixed Protestant - Catholic peace movement .
The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic politicians to form a multiparty administration for Northern Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by October .
Neither of those steps have been taken , even though Irish voters endorsed the accord in May .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">`` We have started .
And we will go on . ...
Sometimes we will stumble , but this need not matter , '' said Trimble , a member of the British Parliament and expected to become Northern Ireland 's prime minister </ENAMEX>.
The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite .
The prizes are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel 's death .
The peace prize , which last year went to International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its American coordinator , Jody Williams , is awarded in Oslo .
The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm , Sweden on the same day .
This year 's winners : Jose Saramago of Portugal for literature ; Americans Robert Furchgott , Louis Ignarro , and Ferid Murad , for medicine ; Indian scholar Amartya Sen for economics ; American researchers Robert Laughlin , Horst Stormer , and Daniel Tsui for physics , and Walter Kohn and John Pople , both U.S. -based , for chemistry .
