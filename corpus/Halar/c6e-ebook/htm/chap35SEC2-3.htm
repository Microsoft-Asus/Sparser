Each tissue system is continuous throughout the plant body, although the specific characteristics of the tissues and their spatial relationships to one another vary in different organs of the plant (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 35.7</span>). Here we survey the three tissue systems as they occur in a young, nonwoody plant.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig35-7','../fig/big/fig35-7.jpg','fig35-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig35-7.jpg" alt="fig35-7" name="myfig35-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 35-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The three tissue systems.</span> The dermal tissue system--epidermis (white) in the case of a young, nonwoody organ--is a single layer of cells that covers the entire body of a young plant. The vascular tissue system (purple) is also continuous throughout the plant, but is arranged differently in each organ. The ground tissue system (yellow), responsible for most of the plant’s metabolic functions, is located between the dermal tissue and the vascular tissue in each organ.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">dermal tissue,</span> or <span class="Emphasis2">epidermis,</span> is generally a single layer of tightly packed cells that covers and protects all young parts of the plant--the "skin" of the plant. In addition to the general function of protection, the epidermis has more specialized characteristics consistent with the function of the particular organ it covers. For example, the root hairs so important in the absorption of water and minerals are extensions of epidermal cells near the tips of roots. The epidermis of leaves and most stems secretes a waxy coating called the <span class="Emphasis2">cuticle</span> that helps the aerial parts of the plant retain water--an important adaptation to living on land (see p. 581).</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Vascular tissue,</span> continuous throughout the plant, is involved in the transport of materials between roots and shoots. The two types of vascular tissue are <span class="Emphasis2">xylem,</span> which conveys water and dissolved minerals upward from roots into the shoots, and <span class="Emphasis2">phloem,</span> which transports food made in mature leaves to the roots and to nonphotosynthetic parts of the shoot system, such as developing leaves and fruits. Both xylem and phloem are composed of a variety of cell types, but those directly involved in long-distance transport are so highly modified as to warrant special discussion.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">The water-conducting elements of xylem, the <span class="Emphasis2">tracheids</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">vessel elements,</span> are elongated cells that are dead at functional maturity. The term <span class="Emphasis1">functional maturity</span> refers to the stage in a cell’s development when it is fully specialized for its function. When the living interior of a tracheid or vessel element disintegrates, the cell’s thickened cell walls remain behind, forming a nonliving conduit through which water can flow (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 35.8</span>). Both tracheids and vessels form in parts of the plant that are no longer elongating. Their secondary walls are interrupted only by <span class="Emphasis2">pits,</span> thinner regions where only primary walls are present (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.28</span> to review primary and secondary walls). Tracheids are long, thin cells with tapered ends. Water moves from cell to cell mainly through the pits, where the water does not have to cross thick secondary walls. Because their secondary walls are hardened with lignin, tracheids function in support as well as water transport. Vessel elements are generally wider, shorter, thinner walled, and less tapered than tracheids. Vessel elements are aligned end to end, forming long micropipes, the <span class="Emphasis2">xylem vessels.</span> The end walls of vessel elements are perforated, enabling water to flow freely through xylem vessels.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig35-8','../fig/big/fig35-8.jpg','fig35-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig35-8.jpg" alt="fig35-8" name="myfig35-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 35-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Water-conducting cells of xylem.</span> Arrows indicate the flow of water. <span class="Emphasis2">(a)</span> Tracheids are spindle-shaped cells with pits through which water flows from cell to cell.

Sieve-tube members are alive at functional maturity, although they lack such organelles as the nucleus, ribosomes, and a distinct vacuole. In angiosperms, the end walls between sieve-tube members, called <span class="Emphasis2">sieve plates,</span> have pores that presumably facilitate the flow of fluid from cell to cell along the sieve tube. Alongside each sieve-tube member is a nonconducting cell called a <span class="Emphasis2">companion cell,</span> which is connected to the sieve-tube member by numerous channels, the plasmodesmata (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 7.8</span>). The nucleus and ribosomes of the companion cell may serve not only that cell but also the adjacent sieve-tube member, which has no nucleus or ribosomes of its own. In some plants, companion cells in leaves also help load sugar produced in the leaf into the sieve-tube members. The phloem then transports the sugar to other parts of the plant.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig35-9','../fig/big/fig35-9.jpg','fig35-9');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig35-9.jpg" alt="fig35-9" name="myfig35-9"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 35-9.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Food-conducting cells of the phloem.</span> Sieve-tube members transport a sugar-rich sap from areas of sugar production (such as leaves) to areas of sugar consumption (such as growing root and shoot tips). <span class="Emphasis2">(a)</span> This diagram of a longitudinal view shows how the sieve-tube members are arranged end to end with porous walls (sieve plates) between them.

In dicot stems, ground tissue is divided into <span class="Emphasis2">pith,</span> internal to the vascular tissue, and <span class="Emphasis2">cortex,</span> external to the vascular tissue. Ground tissue is more than just filler; among its diverse functions are photosynthesis, storage, and support. In fact, ground tissue illustrates the point that each tissue system of a plant consists of a variety of cell types. The cortex of a dicot stem, for example, typically consists of both fleshy storage cells and thick-walled support cells. All plant tissues consist of a variety of the three basic plant cell types that we discuss in the next section.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
