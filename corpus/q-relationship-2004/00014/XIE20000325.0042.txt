OTTAWA , March 25 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- An American intelligence agency has determined that up to 80 percent of foreign attacks on U.S. computers either originate or pass through Canada , the Ottawa Citizen newspaper quoted a report as saying Saturday .
`` The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that a full 80 percent of the attacks upon U.S. systems originate in or pass through Canada , '' states the report , done last year by Canadian military and intelligence agencies for the Canadian Department of National Defense .
The report quotes the Defense Intelligence Agency , the U.S. military 's counterpart to the CIA , as warning that Canada is seen as a `` Zone of Vulnerability , '' and will be under increasing pressure to do more to combat cyberterrorism .
`` It is the assessment of the -LRB- Canadian government 's -RRB- Intelligence Policy Group that the United States and our allies will expect Canada to participate in combating and reducing the cyber threat , '' says the report .
The idea that Canada is home to numerous computer hackers targeting the U.S. is likely to further fuel concerns among American politicians .
Some have already voiced concerns about Canada being a jumping-off point for terrorists trying to sneak into the U.S. , calling Canada a `` Club Med '' for terrorists .
Louis Freeh , director of the FBI -LRB- Federal Bureau of Investigation -RRB- , has also referred to Canada as a `` hacker haven '' and FBI investigators believe one or more Canadian Internet servers were used in the recent attacks that disabled Yahoo.com , eBay and other U.S. -based commercial sites , said the Canadian newspaper .
