Wandering around my hard drive -- ddm 6/17-18/09

 ~/Library/ ddm/Moby-lexicon 
 	    Has subdirectories pointing to such things as

	   mobythes.aur -- the head elements of an assembled
	          thesaurus. Sort of unorganized syn sets
		  
	    mobyposi -- a 273 thousand word list with POS for each word. Would
	        need a lemmatizer to set it up correctly

            10001fr.equ -- List of the thousand most frequent words
                taken from various sources.


  ~/apps/nlp/snapshot_G4_1-2-07/nlp/Fawkes/model/

	Has a set of categories and associated paradigms in Zo
	format. Almost completely oriented towards emotional valience
	in the Monster though.

		generic-verbs, prince-lists, general-categories


 ~/Library/ ddm/WordNet/2.1/dict/
 	    Has files by POS with implicit structure. E.g. adv.exc, verb.exc 
	    have parts of the paradigm on a single line.

	      verb.Framestext has the number to paradigm concordance
	        for the verbs so that gives us some information about
	        constructions. Might go with the raw list in
	        index.verb and work out given a one-off parser but we
	        need the decoder ring.

~/Library/ ddm/verbnet/v1.5 

          Knows a lot about a relatively small number of verbs, with
          cross reference to Beth Levin's classes.  It's in XML --
          there are cross references to WN synsets.

~/Library/ ddm/Molokini-libary/downloaded code/nltk-data-0.3/

	   Lots of good stuff. The 1911 Rogets, excepts from
	   gutenberg, the Brown corpus, Beth Levin's classes (in some
	   form -- haven't unzipped it).

	   The /lexicon subdirectory has the wordlists from Brown and
	   WSJ with POS information but not lemmatized.

	   The Brown corpus itself is the raw text, sentence by
	   sentence, with POS after each word. Separated into a bunch
	   of files presumably by article. Mixed case. Not
	   self-evident where the tag set is taken from.
