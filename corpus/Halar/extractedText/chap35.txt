Chapter 35: PLANT STRUCTURE AND GROWTH

THE PLANT BODY

   Both genes and environment affect plant structure

   Plants have three basic organs: roots, stems, and leaves

   Plant organs are composed of three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground

   Plant tissues are composed of three basic cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma



THE PROCESS OF PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

   Meristems generate cells for new organs throughout the lifetime of a plant: an overview of plant growth

   Primary growth: Apical meristems extend roots and shoots by giving rise to the primary plant body

   Secondary growth: Lateral meristems add girth by producing secondary vascular tissue and periderm



MECHANISMS OF PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

   Molecular biology is revolutionizing the study of plants

   Growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation produce the plant body

   Growth involves both cell division and cell expansion

   Morphogenesis depends on pattern formation

   Cellular differentiation depends on the control of gene expression

   Clonal analysis of the shoot apex emphasizes the importance of a cell's location in its developmental fate

   Phase changes mark major shifts in development

   Genes controlling transcription play key roles in a meristem's change from a vegetative to a floral phase

This unit examines the biology of the flowering plants, or angiosperms. (The structure of algae, mosses, ferns, and gymnosperms was covered in Unit Five, along with the evolutionary relationships of these plant groups to the angiosperms.) With about 250,000 known species, the angiosperms are by far the most diverse and widespread group of land plants. As primary producers, flowering plants are at the base of the food web of nearly every terrestrial ecosystem. Most land animals, including humans, depend on plants directly or indirectly for sustenance. Science has increased agricultural productivity to such an extent that most of us are no longer directly involved in the growing of foods, but this is a recent development; most of us do not have to trace our ancestry too far back to find a farmer. Setting the stage for our study of plant biology, this chapter introduces the structural organization of flowering plants and how this organization develops from a single cell, the zygote.
