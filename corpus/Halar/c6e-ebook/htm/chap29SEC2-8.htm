Continue to think about the problems and opportunities facing organisms that began living on land. In keeping with this theme of evolution, we will compare the life cycles of different plant phyla. It is <span class="Emphasis1">not</span> important for you to memorize the details of these life cycles. What <span class="Emphasis1">is</span> important is to view these diverse life cycles as variations of a common ancestral cycle of alternation of generations. The plant kingdom is monophyletic, meaning that it is derived from a common ancestor (see Chapter 25). Thus, we can interpret the differences we will observe in the life cycles as special reproductive adaptations of the various plant phyla as they diversified from the first plants. In the study of plants, as in the study of all life, an evolutionary perspective connects what would otherwise be an overwhelming collection of seemingly unrelated facts.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
