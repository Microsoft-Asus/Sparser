TOKYO , November 8 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda today expressed Japan 's readiness to promote relations with China despite a territorial dispute between the two countries .

They involve one of the most important tasks that could affect the existence of our country , '' Ikeda said in an interview with the Kyodo news service .
On the two countries ' conflicting claims to the Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea , known in Japan as Senkaku , Ikeda reiterated that Japan 's position on the matter remains unchanged .
But he hastened to note the importance of pursuing sound bilateral ties with China even if bickering over ownership of the isles continues , Kyodo said .
`` You must be fully aware of our position on the Senkaku Islands .
You must also understand that China 's stance is different from ours , '' said Ikeda , who was retained as foreign minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto inaugurated on Thursday .
Hashimoto was re-elected to a second term following last month 's general elections .
`` But we believe we must prevent our important relations from being poisoned over this problem , and China shares this view , '' Kyodo quoted him as saying .
On Tokyo 's economic assistance to Beijing , the foreign minister said Japan will continue to support China 's economic reform efforts , regarding its economic assistance as vital to such a drive .
`` It is important to extend economic cooperation to China in view of our basic stance on relations with the country , including our policy of supporting Chinese efforts to introduce a market-oriented economy and open itself to the outside world , '' Ikeda said .
On the same day , Hashimoto also called for stronger ties with China .
`` We will honestly tackle various issues between Japan and China and make efforts toward further strengthening cooperative relations between the two countries on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties , '' the prime minister told a news conference televised nationwide , referring to commemorations slated for next year .
