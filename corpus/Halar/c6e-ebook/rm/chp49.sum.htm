Integration is a constant activity, with sensory receptors reporting to ongoing cycles of brain activity the results of recent movements, and then future movements being appropriately planned.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">INTRODUCTION TO SENSORY RECEPTION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Sensory receptors transduce stimulus energy and transmit signals to the nervous system (pp. 1059-1060,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.2</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Sensory receptors are usually modified neurons or epithelial cells that detect environmental stimuli and respond with an electrochemical change in their membrane. Exteroreceptors detect external stimuli; interoreceptors detect internal stimuli. Sensory transduction is the conversion of stimulus energy into a change in a membrane potential called a receptor potential. Signal transduction pathways in receptor cells relay and amplify the signal, leading to neurotransmitter release from the receptor cell.</p></LI><LI><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Sensory receptors are categorized by the type of energy they transduce (pp. 1060-1063,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.3</span>-<span class="SmallCap">49.6</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Mechanoreceptors respond to stimuli such as pressure, touch, stretch, motion, and sound. Pain is detected by a group of diverse receptors that respond to excess temperature, pressure, or specific classes of chemicals. Various types of thermoreceptors signal surface and core temperatures of the body. Chemoreceptors respond either to generalized solute concentrations or to specific molecules. Electromagnetic receptors detect energy in the form of different wavelengths of radiation.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">PHOTORECEPTORS AND VISION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">A diversity of photoreceptors has evolved among invertebrates (pp. 1063-1064,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.7</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.8</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The light receptors and visual capabilities of invertebrates vary widely, ranging from the simple light-sensitive eye cup of planarians to the image-forming compound eye of insects and crustaceans and the single-lens eye of some jellies, spiders, and many mollusks.</p></LI><LI><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Vertebrates have single-lens eyes (pp. 1064-1065,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.9</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.10</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The main parts of the vertebrate eye are an outer layer, the sclera, including the transparent cornea; the conjunctiva, a mucous membrane, surrounding all of the sclera except the cornea; the choroid, a pigmented middle layer, which includes the iris, surrounding the pupil; the retina, an inner layer at the back of the eyeball, containing the photoreceptor cells; and the lens, suspended between two chambers in the eye, which focuses light on the retina.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Activity49A:<span class="Emphasis1">

When rods and cones absorb light, signal-transduction pathways hyperpolarize their membrane, and they release less neurotransmitter.</p></LI><LI><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The retina assists the cerebral cortex in processing visual information (pp. 1067-1069,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.15</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.16</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Chemical messages are transmitted from rods and cones to bipolar cells and then to ganglion cells, whose axons in the optic nerve convey action potentials to the brain. Other neurons in the retina integrate information before it is sent to the brain. Most axons of the optic nerves go to the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, from which neurons lead to the primary visual cortex. Several integrating centers in the cerebral cortex are active in creating visual perceptions.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">HEARING AND EQUILIBRIUM</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para19"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear (pp. 1069-1070,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.17</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.18</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The tympanic membrane (eardrum) transmits sound waves to three small bones of the middle ear, which transmit the waves through the oval window to the fluid in the coiled cochlea of the inner ear. Pressure waves vibrate the basilar membrane and the attached organ of Corti, which contains receptor hair cells. The bending of the hairs against the tectorial membrane depolarizes the hair cells, triggering action potentials in the auditory nerve to the brain. Regions of the basilar membrane vibrate more vigorously at different frequencies and transmit to specific auditory areas of the cerebral cortex.</p></LI><LI><a name="para20"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium (pp. 1070-1072,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.19</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The utricle, saccule, and three semicircular canals in the inner ear function in balance and equilibrium.</p></LI><LI><a name="para21"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians (pp. 1072-1073,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 49.20</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> The detection of water movement in fishes and aquatic amphibians is accomplished by a lateral line system of clustered hair cell receptors.</p></LI><LI><a name="para22"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive (p. 1073,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.21</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.22</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Many arthropods have vibrating exoskeletal hairs and localized "ears," consisting of a tympanic membrane and receptor cells, to sense sounds.

In mammals, taste receptors are organized into taste buds that respond to distinct shapes of molecules. Olfactory receptor cells line the upper part of the nasal cavity and send their axons to the olfactory bulb of the brain.</p></LI></UL><SPAN CLASS="Header">MOVEMENT AND LOCOMOTION</SPAN><BR><UL><LI><a name="para24"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity (pp. 1075-1077,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.25</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.26</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> Overcoming friction is a major problem for swimmers; gravity is less of a problem for swimming animals than for those that move on land or fly. Walking, running, hopping, or crawling on land requires an animal to support itself and move against gravity. Flight requires that wings develop enough lift to overcome the downward force of gravity.</p></LI><LI><a name="para25"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement (pp. 1077-1078,</span>&nbsp;<span class="SmallCap">FIGURES 49.27</span>, <span class="SmallCap">49.28</span><span class="Emphasis2">)</span> A hydrostatic skeleton, found in most cnidarians, flatworms, nematodes, and annelids, consists of fluid under pressure in a closed body compartment. Exoskeletons, found in most mollusks and arthropods, are hard coverings deposited on the surface of an animal.

Action potentials travel to the interior of the cell along the T tubules, stimulating the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions bind to the regulatory troponin-tropomyosin complex on the thin filaments, exposing the myosin binding sites on the actin; muscle contraction proceeds.</p><a name="para33"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Web/CD Case Study in the Process of Science: <span class="Emphasis1">

More rapidly delivered signals produce a graded contraction by summation. Tetanus is a state of smooth and sustained contraction obtained when motor neurons deliver a volley of action potentials. A motor unit consists of a branched motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. Multiple motor unit recruitment results in stronger contractions. Cardiac muscle, found only in the heart, consists of striated, branching cells that are electrically connected by intercalated discs. Cardiac muscle cells can generate action potentials without neural input. In smooth muscle, contractions are slow but can be sustained over long periods of time.</p></LI></UL></table></body></html>
