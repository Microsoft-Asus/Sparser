As we discussed in Chapter 21, two general principles integrate our current knowledge of the genetic and cellular mechanisms that underlie differentiation during embryonic development:</p><OL type="1"><LI><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In many animal species (mammals may be a major exception), the heterogeneous distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the unfertilized egg leads to regional differences in the early embryo</span>. By partitioning the heterogeneous cytoplasm of a polarized egg, cleavage parcels out different mRNAs, proteins, and other molecules to different blastomeres. These local differences in cytoplasmic composition help specify the body axes and influence the expression of genes that affect the developmental fate of cells. Thus, cytoplasmic determinants are responsible for the initial differences between cells in the early embryos of many kinds of animals.</p></LI><LI><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Subsequently, in induction, interactions among the embryonic cells themselves induce changes in gene expression. These interactions eventually bring about the differentiation of the many specialized cell types making up a new animal</span>. Induction may be mediated by diffusible chemical signals, or if the cells are actually in contact, by cell-surface interactions. (In Chapter 21 we saw how both types of cell signaling are involved in the development of the nematode vulva.)</p></LI></OL><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">It will help to keep these two principles in mind when we take a closer look at the molecular and cellular mechanisms of differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrate development. First, however, let’s look at some historic experiments that provided early researchers with information about cell fates.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
