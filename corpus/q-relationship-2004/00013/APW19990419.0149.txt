WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Energy Department and its contractors showed `` a lack of attention '' to grave security risks at nuclear weapons labs despite nearly two decades of warnings , congressional investigators report .
`` Efforts to address security problems have languished for years without resolution or repercussions to those organizations responsible , '' the General Accounting Office concluded in testimony prepared for a House Commerce subcommittee hearing today and obtained Monday by The Associated Press .
Congress ' investigative agency said it has issued 32 reports since 1980 warning of lax security at the labs , and made nearly 50 recommendations that the GAO said were mostly neglected .
`` Managers and contractors have shown a lack of attention and/or priority to security matters , '' according to Victor S. Rezendes , director of the GAO division that studies energy and scientific issues .
The problems at the labs became a major issue earlier this year , when the Energy Department disclosed that it had evidence indicating China obtained information about the most advanced nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal -- and had used that information to develop its own smaller , more deliverable nuclear weapons .
An employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was fired , but no charges have been filed .
In just one example of how the same security problems persisted over two decades , and came full circle , Rezendes said FBI agents had been used in the early 1990s to conduct counterintelligence .
The bureau ended the effort `` because of resistance within DOE to implementing the measures the FBI staff believed necessary to improve security , '' the GAO found .
`` We note with interest that in response to the current concerns with foreign visitors and other espionage threats against DOE facilities , the FBI is again being brought in to direct DOE 's counterintelligence program , '' the investigators reported .
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Monday the department was taking `` very aggressive steps '' to fix the problems cited by the GAO , including : --Increasing the counterintelligence budget from $ 2.6 million to $ 39.2 million since 1995 .
--Appointing a CIA and FBI veteran , Ed Curran , as director of counterintelligence .
--Placing seasoned counterintelligence professionals at nuclear weapons labs .
--Instituting a new lie detector program .
--Revamping the foreign visitors ' program , including background checks for all visitors from countries considered `` sensitive. '' .
`` Since taking over as secretary of energy -LRB- in August 1998 -RRB- , nothing has been more important to me than ensuring that the security and counterintelligence capabilities of the department are topnotch , '' Richardson said .
Rep. Thomas Bliley , R - Va. , chairman of the House Commerce Committee reviewing the labs practices , said he wanted to see `` whether the administration 's announced reforms will truly do the job , but if history is any guide , I have my doubts . ''
Rezendes said the most serious problems that were not addressed by the department over the past two decades were : --Ineffective controls over foreign visitors to the most sensitive Energy Department facilities .
In 1988 and again in 1997 , the GAO found `` that foreign visitors are allowed into ... nuclear weapons design laboratories with few background checks '' and that counterintelligence programs `` received little priority and attention . ''
--Weaknesses in efforts to control and protect classified and sensitive information .
In one instance , a facility could not account for 10,000 classified documents .
--Lack of physical security such as fences , and security personnel who , through the years , have proved unable to demonstrate basic skills such as arresting intruders , shooting accurately or using handcuffs .
--Backlogs in security clearances .
And at times when backlogs were reduced , contractors were failing to verify background information on prospective employees .
--A failure to track and control nuclear materials , including material sent overseas .
As an example of the past problems , the GAO report cited findings -- originally in 1988 -- that the required background checks were performed for fewer than 10 percent of the visitors from `` sensitive '' countries .
When the agency reviewed the same problem in 1997 , `` procedures for obtaining background checks had not been effectively implemented and at two facilities , background checks were being conducted on only 5 percent of visitors from all sensitive countries and on less than 2 percent of the visitors from China .
