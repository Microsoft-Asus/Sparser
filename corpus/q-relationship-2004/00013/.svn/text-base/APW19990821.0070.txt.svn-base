WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">In a highly unusual move , the CIA pulled the security clearances for former Director John Deutch , unwilling to excuse his violation of agency rules by keeping secret files on an unsecured home computer .</ENAMEX>
Central Intelligence Agency spokesman William Harlow said Friday he knew of no precedent for the action taken against Deutch , a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public service before leaving the CIA in December 1996 .
The decision to suspend Deutch 's security clearances was made by CIA Director George Tenet , Deutch 's successor .
Tenet acted after reviewing an inspector general 's report on Deutch 's improper handling of classified materials .
`` Director Tenet regrets that it was necessary for him to take this action , particularly in light of Dr. Deutch 's distinguished record of public service , '' the CIA public affairs office said in a written statement .
Deutch issued a written statement through the CIA in which he acknowledged he erred by using an unsecured computer to write classified documents and memoranda at his home .
He stressed that investigators found no information was compromised as a result of his lapses .
`` I respect the decision of the director to suspend my CIA clearances , '' Deutch said .
`` As for the future , I intend to do everything in my power to reassure my colleagues at the agency of my commitment to comply with the rules that safeguard classified information . ''
The inspector general 's report to Tenet on July 13 is classified .
Tenet said it found no evidence that national security information was lost due to Deutch 's security lapses , but `` potential for damage to U.S. security existed . ''
The CIA normally does not announce suspension of security clearances but did this time because of prior news coverage about the Deutch case , officials said .
John Pike , an intelligence specialist at the Federation of American Scientists , said he believes Tenet acted because of the public uproar over allegations that Wen Ho Lee , a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , gave China secrets about America 's nuclear arsenal .
The Lee investigation has unleashed an avalanche of charges about government inattention to lapses in protection of classified materials .
`` There was no way they could conceivably explain letting Deutch off the hook '' in light of the Lee case , Pike said , even though most officials regarded Deutch 's lapses at the time as `` the sort of normal violation that is against the rules but is frequently practiced '' and not punished .
Deutch is an unpaid consultant to the CIA .
The suspension of his security clearances makes it unlikely that the relationship will continue , Terrence O'Donnell , his personal attorney , said in an interview .
O'Donnell said the CIA gave no assurance when the suspension might be reconsidered .
Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996 .
When he was leaving his CIA post , agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that secrets were properly protected .
They found 31 classified documents on a CIA -issued computer not configured for classified work .
The Justice Department decided in April not to prosecute Deutch but recommended that the CIA review Deutch 's continued suitability to hold high-level security clearances .
It concluded that Deutch 's security lapses were reckless rather than criminal .
In its statement Friday , the CIA said Tenet decided to suspend Deutch 's clearances indefinitely in light of the `` nature of the security violations involved '' and the former director 's responsibility as a senior intelligence official to set the highest standards in the protection of classified information .
Just last month , Deutch concluded a stint as chairman of a bipartisan commission that assessed the government 's preparedness to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction , a role in which he relied on CIA security clearances .
