(Fertilization and embryonic development in plants are described in Chapter 38.) The main objective of plant developmental biology is to understand how this single cell gives rise to a multicellular plant of particular form with functionally integrated cells, tissues, and organs. With each meristematic cell possessing the same genetic information, why should one cell become a sieve-tube member in the phloem while another becomes a vessel element in the xylem? Or why should a particular region of the shoot apex give rise to leaves at one time and later to flowers? In considering these questions, we must bear in mind that plants have tremendous developmental plasticity. A plant’s form, including height, branching patterns, and reproductive output, is greatly influenced by environmental factors, and a broad range of morphologies can result from the same genotype. (Chapter 39 considers how plants respond to environmental factors.)</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">Three developmental processes acting in concert are responsible for transforming the fertilized egg into a plant: growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation.
