<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Japan is ready to take action if Chinese activists from Hong Kong illegally challenge its control over a group of uninhabited islands , the coast guard said Tuesday .</ENAMEX>
`<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">` We are prepared to respond appropriately to any illegal entry , '' said Akira Suzuki , spokesman of the Maritime Safety Agency 's regional headquarters on Okinawa </ENAMEX>.
Suzuki also said the agency , Japan 's coast guard , maintains air and sea patrols around the disputed islands , known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese .
The islands , located about 220 kilometers -LRB- 136 miles -RRB- northeast of Taipei in the East China Sea , are controlled by Japan but claimed by both Taiwan and China .
A group of 25 activists set out in a 10-ton trawler from a Hong Kong port Sunday with the intention of joining a separate group from Taiwan to protest Japanese control over the disputed territory .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The group plans to plant a Chinese flag on one of the islands to protest Japan 's rival claim , expedition leader Albert Ho has said .
Two years ago , a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels kept him from landing on the islands .</ENAMEX>
On a later protest expedition , several activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the islands .
Also , in May 1997 , the coast guard prevented Japanese right-wing activists from reaching one of the islands , where they have built two lighthouses .
One of the lighthouses later was reportedly knocked down by a storm .
