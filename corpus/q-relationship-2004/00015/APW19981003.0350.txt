TEHRAN , Iran
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Iranian police have confiscated more than five metric tons -LRB- 5.5 short tons -RRB- of drugs that they say were produced by Afghanistan 's Taliban militia , the Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday .
The drugs , confiscated over the past couple of days , included heroin , opium and morphine , said the paper quoting the chief of police in the northeastern Khorasan province , which borders Afghanistan .
`` Because of the high market value of these drugs in Europe , the Taliban have been especially active in producing and smuggling them , '' the paper quoted police chief Bahran Nourowzi as saying .
It did not give details about the seizure or say if any arrests were made .
Washington and Tehran believe that the drug trade helps finance the Taliban militia , which rules over 90 percent of Afghanistan .
Iran asked that the United Nations speed up plans to develop alternative livelihoods for poppy growers in Afghanistan , which , together with Burma , accounts for 90 percent of the world 's supply of opium -- the raw material used to produce heroin .
Large drug hauls are common in Iran , which lies on a route used by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the oil-rich Gulf and Europe .
Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988 .
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity of narcotics .
