COLOMBO , November 7 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- In a surprise offensive that began late Monday , Sri Lanka 's Tamil rebels had overrun one army base another and by Sunday had regained a large part of the northern Wanni region which was captured by the army last year .
`` The Sri Lankan government has taken a severe blow in its military strategy to capture the Tamil homeland , '' said Anton Raja , a spokesman for the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- .
Army spokesman Brigadier Sunil Thennakoon said the LTTE rebels struck in retaliation for army advances on the rebels ' headquarters of Mullaitivu on Sri Lanka 's northeastern coast .
The fighting , the bloodiest in 14 months , has proved the government 's military strategy is in tatters , just weeks before President Chandrika Kumaratunga was asking voters for a new mandate in the forthcoming presidential poll on December 21 to finally settle the 16-year -old ethnic war .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The LTTE said the offensive , codenamed `` Unceasing Waves 3 , '' was planned and directed by its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran .</ENAMEX>
The fighting has been concentrated in the heavily forested Wanni region , about 280 kilometers north of the capital Colombo .
During the fighting the rebels have captured about 10 army bases strategically located west of its present headquarters of Mullaitivu , which was captured by the rebels in July , 1996 .
The LTTE rebels said they had lost 100 fighters and the Defense Ministry said 211 of its troops were dead or missing in the action .
But military sources said the casualties could be much higher .
`` Over 1,000 troops have been killed and double that number injured during the last four days of heavy fighting , '' the LTTE said in a statement on Saturday .
The rebels have been fighting a drawn-out war against the government for an independent homeland in this tropical island 's north and east since 1983 .
In a war that has been dragging on so long , neither the government nor the LTTE rebels seem able to win .
Successive governments have failed to find a solution to the deadlock , unable to win the war and unwilling to allow the rebels to establish a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka 's north and east .
Kumaratunga was elected in November 1994 on a promise that she would bring peace through talks .
After her talks with Tiger rebels ended in failure in April 1995 , Kumaratunga adopted what is known as a war-for-peace strategy to contain the rebels .
The government 's strategy has been to weaken the LTTE militarily to force them to the negotiating table .
Since then , the army has scored significant gains by capturing LTTE 's former stronghold Jaffna in 1996 and reducing the amount of rebel territory from 9,100 square kilometers in 1994 to 3,200 square kilometers at present .
Though the army 's territorial gains in the north and east since 1995 have been important successes , government soldiers have become tied down to the newly acquired real estate , leaving hardly any manpower for more operations .
Before the latest fighting , there had been concerns that the military was over-stretched and spreading too thin and did n't have enough manpower to hold on to the area it had taken during the past series of operations .
The 120,000-strong army needs at least 20,000 more men if the current war against the LTTE is to be conducted with any degree of success and at least twice its present number for a decisive victory , military analysts here said .
However , the army finds it hard to recruit newcomers and many soldiers are suffering from war-fatigue .
Despite the significant gains , victory is elusive and neither side seems able to finally defeat the other .
The seesaw battle indicates that a military solution to the war is impossible , analysts said .
The latest loss follow earlier losses of key bases like Kilinochchi in September last year and Mullaitivu in 1996 .
Kilinochchi 's loss forced the government in last December to call off its biggest ground offensive codenamed Sure Victory against the LTTE that was launched in May 1997 to open a land route to the northern Jaffna peninsula .
`` The LTTE have time and again shown they are capable of hitting back at key points .
It seems difficult to weaken them militarily and then force them to negotiate peace , '' a diplomat here said .
Besides , Kumaratunga proposed a peace proposal in August 1995 to devolve powers to regional councils to partly meet the LTTE 's demand for independence .
But four years later , she has failed to push the proposal through the parliament .
The president has blamed the main opposition United National Party for not backing her plans for devolution of power as a way out of the ethnic conflict .
Nevertheless , Kumaratunga said peace is still within her grasp .
She set early presidential election for December 21 in the hope of gaining a strong mandate to end the war .
She had said peace will be achieved within a couple of months if she was reelected to the office .
Analysts said she was counting on a strong military advance before the vote to show she could force the rebels into negotiations .
But now , the government has suffered heavy losses and must deal with claims that election tactics were behind the deaths .
The opposition alleged the military setback is a result of the government trying to use the army to boost the president 's fortunes in the run-up to the presidential poll .
Analysts said any further escalation of fighting and greater losses could affect Kumaratunga 's reelection hopes .
But it 's by no means certain that the bloodshed will have a decisive effect on the vote as people have accepted the seemingly unending bloodshed as a way of life .
Mounting deaths among government troops and more losses of territory may even encourage the president to postpone the election citing security reasons , said analysts .
President Kumaratunga used the ongoing war to postpone provincial council elections that were due in August last year till April this year .
Meanwhile , Kumaratunga said in a letter made public Friday that she planned to start talks with the rebels `` as soon as it is practically possible to do so . ''
The president has said the doors were open for talks if the rebels agree to lay down their arms , giving up their demand for a separate homeland and accept a timeframe for negotiations .
If the latest loss emphasized that a military solution to the conflict was not possible and the two sides need to talk urgently , it could be seen as a positive development , analysts said .
But if it is taken as a humiliating situation that needs to be responded , then the war will be only protracted , they said .
