Members of phylum Cnidaria (hydras; jellies, also called "jellyfishes"; sea anemones; and their relatives) and phylum Ctenophora (comb jellies) have <span class="Emphasis2">radial symmetry</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.5a</span>) and are collectively called <span class="Emphasis2">radiata.</span> A radial animal has a top and bottom, or an oral (mouth) and an aboral side, but no head end and rear end and no left and right. The other major branch of eumetazoan evolution led to animals with <span class="Emphasis2">bilateral</span> (two-sided) <span class="Emphasis2">symmetry</span> (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.5b</span>). A bilateral animal has not only a <span class="Emphasis2">dorsal</span> (top) side and a <span class="Emphasis2">ventral</span> (bottom) side, but also an <span class="Emphasis2">anterior</span> (head) end and a <span class="Emphasis2">posterior</span> (tail) end and a left and right side.

In most bilateral animals, cephalization also includes the development of a central nervous system concentrated in the head and extending toward the tail as a longitudinal nerve cord. A head end is an adaptation for movement, such as crawling, burrowing, or swimming. The symmetry of an animal generally fits its lifestyle. Many radial animals are sessile forms (attached to a substratum) or plankton (drifting or weakly swimming aquatic forms). Their symmetry equips them to meet the environment equally well from all sides. Most animals that move actively from place to place are bilateral. These two fundamentally different kinds of symmetry probably arose very early in the history of animal life.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText">Another difference in body plan helps define the radiata-bilateria split: In all animals except sponges, the embryo becomes layered through the process of gastrulation (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.1</span>). As development progresses, these concentric layers, called <span class="Emphasis2">germ layers,</span> form the various tissues and organs of the body. <span class="Emphasis2">Ectoderm,</span> covering the surface of the embryo, gives rise to the outer covering of the animal and, in some phyla, to the central nervous system. <span class="Emphasis2">Endoderm,</span> the innermost germ layer, lines the developing digestive tube, or <span class="Emphasis2">archenteron,</span> and gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and organs derived from it, such as the liver and lungs of vertebrates. All eumetazoans except cnidarians and ctenophores (the radiata) have a third germ layer, the <span class="Emphasis2">mesoderm,</span> between the ectoderm and endoderm. Mesoderm forms the muscles and most other organs between the digestive tube and the outer covering of the animal. Cnidarians and ctenophores have only two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm) or have a third layer that is not homologous with the mesoderm of bilateral animals. As a group, the radiata are said to be <span class="Emphasis2">diploblastic</span> (having two germ layers). All other eumetazoans, the bilateria, are <span class="Emphasis2">triploblastic</span> (having three germ layers).</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">

This group includes phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.6a</span>, p. 638).

Its fluid cushions the suspended organs, helping to prevent internal injury. In soft-bodied coelomates such as earthworms, the noncompressible fluid of the body cavity is under pressure and functions as a hydrostatic skeleton against which muscles can work. The cavity also enables the internal organs to grow and move independently of the outer body wall. If it were not for your coelom, every beat of your heart or ripple of your intestine could deform your body surface, and exercise would distort the shapes of the internal organs.</p><a name="para12"></a><p class="BlockText">

		<span class="Emphasis1">The Protostome-Deuterostome Dichotomy Among Coelomates</span></p><a name="para13"></a><p class="BlockText">The coelomate phyla are divided into two distinct grades: <span class="Emphasis2">Protostomia</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">Deuterostomia.</span> Mollusks, annelids, arthropods, and several other phyla represent one of these grades and are collectively called <span class="Emphasis2">protostomes.</span> Echinoderms, chordates, and some other phyla, collectively called <span class="Emphasis2">deuterostomes,</span> represent the other grade. (Some zoologists include the acoelomates and pseudocoelomates with the protostomes in the traditional phylogenetic tree, but this text uses the term protostome <span class="Emphasis1">only</span> as a subgroup of coelomate animals.) Protostomes and deuterostomes are distinguished by several fundamental differences in their development.</p><a name="para14"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Cleavage.</span>The pattern of cleavage divisions during early development generally differs between the two coelomate branches, though there are many exceptions to this distinction. Many protostomes undergo <span class="Emphasis2">spiral cleavage,</span> in which planes of cell division are diagonal to the vertical axis of the em bryo. As seen in the eight-cell stage resulting from spiral cleavage, small cells lie in the grooves between larger, underlying cells (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.7a</span>). Furthermore, the so-called <span class="Emphasis2">determinate cleavage</span> of some protostomes rigidly casts the developmental fate of each embryonic cell very early. A cell isolated at the four-cell stage from a snail, for example, forms an inviable embryo that lacks parts.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig32-7','../fig/big/fig32-7.jpg','fig32-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig32-7.jpg" alt="fig32-7" name="myfig32-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 32-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A comparison of early development in protostomes and deuterostomes.</span> These are useful general distinctions, though there are many variations and exceptions to these patterns of development.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText">In contrast to the spiral cleavage pattern, the zygotes of many deuterostomes undergo <span class="Emphasis2">radial cleavage.</span> Here, the cleavage planes are either parallel or perpendicular to the vertical axis of the egg; as seen in the eight-cell stage, the tiers of cells are aligned, one directly above the other. Most deuterostomes are further characterized by <span class="Emphasis2">indeterminate cleavage,</span> meaning that each cell produced by early cleavage divisions retains the capacity to develop into a complete embryo. For example, if the cells of a sea star embryo are separated at the four-cell stage, each will go on to form a normal larva. It is the indeterminate cleavage of the human zygote that makes identical twins possible. This characteristic also explains the developmental versatility of the embryonic "stem cells" that may provide new ways to overcome a variety of diseases, including juvenile diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (see Chapter 21).</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Coelom Formation.</span>Another difference between protostomes and deuterostomes is apparent later in development. In gastrulation, the developing digestive tube of an embryo initially forms as a blind pouch, the archenteron. As the archenteron forms in a protostome, initially solid masses of mesoderm split to form the coelomic cavities; this is called <span class="Emphasis2">schizocoelous</span> development (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">schizo</span>, split). Development of the body cavities of deuterostomes is termed <span class="Emphasis2">enterocoelous:</span> The mesoderm buds from the wall of the archenteron and hollows to become the coelomic cavities (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.7b</span>).</p><a name="para17"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Blastopore Fate.</span>A third fundamental difference between protostomes and deuterostomes is in the fate of the <span class="Emphasis2">blastopore,</span> the opening of the archenteron. After the archenteron develops, a second opening forms at the opposite end of the gastrula. Ultimately, the blastopore and this second opening become the two ends of the digestive tube (the mouth and the anus). The mouth of many protostomes develops from the first opening, the blastopore, and it is for this characteristic that the protostome grade is named (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">protos</span>, first, and <span class="Emphasis1">stoma</span>, mouth). In contrast, the mouth of a deuterostome (from the Greek <span class="Emphasis1">deuteros</span>, second) is derived from the secondary opening, and the blastopore usually forms the anus, not the mouth (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.7c</span>).</p><a name="para18"></a><p class="BlockText">Let us now compare and contrast the traditional phylogenetic tree of animals based on grades in body plan (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 32.4</span>) with an emerging view of animal phylogeny based mainly on molecular systematics.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
