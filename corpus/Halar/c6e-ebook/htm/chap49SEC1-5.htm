Chemical "conversation" is especially important for animals, such as ants and bees, that live in large social groups. In all animals, taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are important in feeding behavior. For example, a hydra begins to swallow when chemoreceptors detect the compound glutathione, which is released from prey captured by the hydra’s tentacles.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
