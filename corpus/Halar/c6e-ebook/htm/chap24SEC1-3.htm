Microevolution is a change over the generations in a population’s allele frequencies, mainly by genetic drift and natural selection. Speciation occurs when a population’s genetic divergence from its ancestral population results in reproductive isolation. The change in morphology during that divergence may be very conspicuous when we compare two closely related species, but usually the differences are more subtle, such as the color difference between the two cichlid species in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 24.16</span>. Yet the cumulative change during millions of speciation episodes over vast tracts of time must account for macroevolution, the level of change that is evident over the time scale of the fossil record. How, for example, did feathers and other flight equipment evolve during the descent of birds from reptiles? Put more generally, how do the evolutionary novelties that define taxonomic groups above the species level, such as classes and phyla, evolve? In this last section, we look at some of the mechanisms behind macroevolution.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
