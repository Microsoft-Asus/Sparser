LAGOS , July 16 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United Nations World Food Program has earmarked 31.5 million U.S. Dollars to help feed returning refugees and displaced persons in Sierra Leone , a report from Freetown said Thursday .
The report quoted the state radio as saying that the package was part of an agreement signed Wednesday in the Sierra Leonean capital .
It aims to feed 452,840 people by providing 46,359 tons of food , including soya beans , cereals and oil , the report said .
Relief officials in Freetown estimated that over a million people , or a quarter of the Sierra Leonean population , fled abroad or were displaced during the West African country 's seven years of political unrest since 1991 .
The figure shot up after the coup in May 1997 that temporarily ousted elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah , who were restored to power in March this year with the help of the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG .
The U.N. has started repatriating refugees from Liberia , Guinea and Gambia , but officials said plans for a mass repatriation of some 500,000 refugees have been put on hold to security concerns in the hinterland areas .
