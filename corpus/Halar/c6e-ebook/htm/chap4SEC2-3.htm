The skeletons vary in length and may be straight, branched, or arranged in closed rings (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.4</span>). Some carbon skeletons have double bonds, which vary in number and location. Such variation in carbon skeletons is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that characterize living matter.

For example, the molecules known as fats have long hydrocarbon tails attached to a nonhydrocarbon component (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.5</span>). Neither petroleum nor fat mixes with water; both are hydrophobic compounds because the bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms are nonpolar. Another characteristic of hydrocarbons is that they store a relatively large amount of energy. The gasoline that fuels a car consists of hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbon tails of fat molecules serve as stored fuel for animal bodies.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig4-5','../fig/big/fig4-5.jpg','fig4-5');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig4-5.jpg" alt="fig4-5" name="myfig4-5"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 4-5.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The role of hydrocarbons in fats.

The number of possible isomers increases tremendously as carbon skeletons increase in size. There are only two butanes, but there are 18 variations of C<SUB>8</SUB>H<SUB>18</SUB> and 366,319 possible structural isomers of C<SUB>20</SUB>H<SUB>42</SUB>. Structural isomers may also differ in the location of double bonds.</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Geometric isomers</span> have the same covalent partnerships, but they differ in their spatial arrangements. Geometric isomers arise from the inflexibility of double bonds, which, unlike single bonds, will not allow the atoms they join to rotate freely about the bond axis. The subtle difference in shape between geometric isomers can dramatically affect the biological activities of organic molecules. For example, the biochemistry of vision involves a light-induced change of rhodopsin, a chemical compound in the eye, from one geometric isomer to another.</p><a name="para07"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Enantiomers</span> are molecules that are mirror images of each other. In the ball-and-stick models shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.6c</span>, the middle carbon is called an <span class="Emphasis1">asymmetric carbon</span> because it is attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms. The four groups can be arranged in space about the asymmetric carbon in two different ways that are mirror images. They are, in a way, left-handed and right-handed versions of the molecule. A cell can distinguish these isomers based on their different shapes. Usually, one isomer is biologically active and the other is inactive.</p><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText">The concept of enantiomers is important in the pharmaceutical industry because the two enantiomers of a drug may not be equally effective (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.7</span>). In some cases, one of the isomers may even produce harmful effects. This was the case with thalidomide, a drug prescribed for thousands of pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The drug was a mixture of two enantiomers. One enantiomer reduced morning sickness, the desired effect, but the other caused severe birth defects. (And unfortunately, even if the "good" thalidomide enantiomer is used in purified form, some of it soon converts to the "bad" enantiomer in the patient’s body.) The differing effects of enantiomers in the body demonstrate that organisms are sensitive to even the most subtle variations in molecular architecture. Once again, we see that molecules have emergent properties that depend on the specific arrangement of their atoms.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig4-7','../fig/big/fig4-7.jpg','fig4-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig4-7.jpg" alt="fig4-7" name="myfig4-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 4-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The pharmacological importance of enantiomers.</span> L-Dopa is a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease, a disorder of the central nervous system.
