									<a name="para87"></a><p class="BlockText">Acid rain contains an abnormally high concentration of hydrogen ions (H<SUP>+</SUP>). One effect of acid rain is to deplete the soil of plant nutrients such as calcium (Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>), potassium (K<SUP>+</SUP>), and magnesium (Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>). Suggest a hypothesis to explain why acid rain washes these nutrients from the soil. How might you test your hypothesis?</p>

									<a name="para89"></a><p class="BlockText">About 10%  of U.S. cropland is irrigated. Agriculture is by far the biggest user of water in arid western states, including Colorado, Arizona, and California. The populations of these states are growing, and there is an ongoing conflict between cities and farm regions over water. To ensure water supplies for urban growth, cities are purchasing water rights from farmers. This is often the least expensive way for a city to obtain more water, and it is possible for some farmers to make more money selling water rights than growing crops. Discuss the possible consequences of this trend. Is this the best way to allocate water for all concerned? Why or why not?</p>
