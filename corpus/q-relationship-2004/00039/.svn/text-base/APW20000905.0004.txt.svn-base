TOKYO
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The leaders of Japan and Russia failed to resolve a decades -old territorial dispute in two days of talks , but promised Tuesday to keep up negotiations toward completing a World War II peace treaty this year .</ENAMEX>
Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the disagreement over four Russia -controlled islands north of Japan .
`` We confirmed that we will continue negotiations for a peace treaty by resolving the issue the sovereignty over the four islands , based on all the negotiations in the past , '' Mori said .
The two leaders also pledged closer cooperation in regional security and economics , with Putin emphasizing that he wanted Tokyo and Moscow to tighten their strategic relationship and ensure stability in Northeast Asia .
`` I hope in the near future we will keenly feel that both countries are vital to the other , '' Putin said at a joint news conference at the ornate State Guesthouse .
The Mori - Putin talks this week were the latest round in a series of efforts over the past decade to overcome the enmity of the war and five decades of Cold War hostilities .
Tokyo and Moscow established diplomatic relations in 1956 , but have never signed a treaty ending World War II .
The major roadblock to a treaty has been the dispute over four islands north of Japan that Soviet troops occupied in the closing days of the war .
Tokyo is insisting on its claims to the islands , but Russia has so far refused to relinquish them .
The dispute mixes economics with emotion .
The islands -- called the Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan -- are surrounded by rich fishing grounds , and the islands ' location in the northern Pacific makes them strategic .
Both sides also see the issue as one of national pride .
Russian leaders are loathe to lose another piece of the former Soviet Union , while Tokyo still smarts from the forced evacuation of 10,000 Japanese from the islands in 1945 .
While Mori and Putin held talks on Monday , right-wing extremists circled the venue in black sound trucks , blaring martial music and demanding a return of the islands .
The dispute has proved so intractable that many doubt declarations that Russia and Japan will be able to conclude a treaty this year .
Moscow has pushed for signing a treaty without resolving the island dispute , but Tokyo has stood firm .
Putin said Tuesday that the deadline was not set in stone .
`` The important thing is not setting up a deadline , but that both countries have good faith , '' he said .
The talks this week made no progress on the issue , with both sides outlining previous stances .
Tokyo , for example , is pushing a two-year proposal to allow continued Russian administration of the islands in exchange for recognition of Japanese sovereignty .
Moscow has not accepted that idea .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In other areas , the two sides signed agreements including a program on developing trade and economic relations , joint efforts to aid the economic development of the Kurils , cooperation in energy , Japanese assistance in dismantling Russian nuclear arsenals and strengthening cooperation between the two nations ' border guards .</ENAMEX>
Putin was to leave later Tuesday .
At the end of Monday 's talks , Mori presented Putin with a robot dog that barks out Russian tunes .
