CAIRO , Egypt
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Turkish warplanes have killed 38 civilians in a strike on a camp of Kurdish herdsmen in Iraq , an Iraqi Kurdish group said Thursday .
A military spokesman in Turkey 's capital Ankara denied the allegation , saying that Turkish planes would not attack civilian targets .
The planes attacked a camp of herdsmen and their families while pursuing Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq , the Kurdistan Democratic Party , or KDP , said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo .
Turkey has waged a 15-year war against Kurdish guerrillas who are demanding autonomy in southern Turkey , which borders on Iraq .
The KDP statement was n't clear on exactly when the attack occurred , indicating it was either on Tuesday or Wednesday .
The group could n't be reached for a clarification .
The statement also said that 11 people were wounded in the alleged raid and four were missing .
The pilots had intended to strike targets of the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK in the northeastern border region of Iraq , the statement said .
The PKK declared a cease-fire early this year and the rebels began retreating from Turkey to bases in Iraq and Iran .
The Turkish armed forces did not recognize the cease-fire .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In the past , KDP forces have assisted the Turkish military in operations against the PKK inside Iraq .
The KDP and the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan control the Kurdish zone of northern Iraq , an area whose autonomy has been protected by U.S. and British planes since Iraqi government forces brutally put down a Kurdish revolt there in 1991 .</ENAMEX>
