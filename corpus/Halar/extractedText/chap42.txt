Chapter 42: CIRCULATION AND GAS EXCHANGE

CIRCULATION IN ANIMALS

   Transport systems functionally connect the organs of exchange with the body cells: an overview

   Most invertebrates have a gastrovascular cavity or a circulatory system for internal transport

   Vertebrate phylogeny is reflected in adaptations of the cardiovascular system

   Double circulation in mammals depends on the anatomy and pumping cycle of the heart

   Structural differences of arteries, veins, and capillaries correlate with their different functions

   Physical laws governing the movement of fluids through pipes affect blood flow and blood pressure

   Transfer of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid occurs across the thin walls of capillaries

   The lymphatic system returns fluid to the blood and aids in body defense

   Blood is a connective tissue with cells suspended in plasma

   Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States and most other developed nations



GAS EXCHANGE IN ANIMALS

   Gas exchange supplies oxygen for cellular respiration and disposes of carbon dioxide: an overview

   Gills are respiratory adaptations of most aquatic animals

   Tracheal systems and lungs are respiratory adaptations of terrestrial animals

   Control centers in the brain regulate the rate and depth of breathing

   Gases diffuse down pressure gradients in the lungs and other organs

   Respiratory pigments transport gases and help buffer the blood

   Deep-diving air-breathers stockpile oxygen and deplete it slowly

Every organism must exchange materials and energy with its environment, and this exchange ultimately occurs at the cellular level. Cells live in aqueous surroundings; the resources they need, such as nutrients and oxygen, move across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, and metabolic wastes, such as carbon dioxide, move out of the cell.

The feathery external gills projecting from the salmon shown above present an expansive surface area to the outside environment. A network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) lies close to the outside surface of the gills. Oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water diffuses across the thin epithelium covering the gills and into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses out into the water.

Salmon and most other animals have organ systems specialized for exchanging materials with the environment, and many have an internal transport system that conveys fluid (blood or interstitial fluid) throughout the body.

In this chapter you will learn about mechanisms of internal transport in animals. You will also learn about one of the most important cases of chemical transfer between animals and their environment: the exchange of the gases oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is essential to cellular respiration and bioenergetics.
