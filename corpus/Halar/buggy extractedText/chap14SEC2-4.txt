 Mendelian inheritance reflects rules of probability

Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins or rolling dice. A basic understanding of these rules of chance is essential for genetic analysis.

The probability scale ranges from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1, while an event that is certain not to occur has a probability of 0. With a two-headed coin, the probability of tossing heads is 1, and the probability of tossing tails is 0. With a normal coin, the chance of tossing heads is 1/2, and the chance of tossing tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling the number 3 with a die, which is six-sided, is 1/6. The probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event must add up to 1. With a die, the chance of rolling a number other than 3 is 5/6.

We can learn an important lesson about probability from tossing a coin. For every toss, the probability of heads is 1/2. The outcome of any particular toss is unaffected by what has happened on previous trials. We refer to phenomena such as successive coin tosses, or simultaneous tosses of several coins, as independent events. The question of whether a tossed coin will come up heads or tails is analogous to the question of whether a gamete produced by a Pp heterozygote will carry allele P or allele p (FIGURE 14.8). In every fertilization involving such gametes, the ovum has a 1/2 chance of carrying the dominant allele and a 1/2 chance of carrying the recessive allele. The same odds apply to the sperm cell. Like two separate coin tosses, allele segregation during formation of the sperm and ovum occurs as two independent events.

Fig 14-8. Segregation of alleles and fertilization as chance events. When a heterozygote (Pp) forms gametes, segregation of alleles is like the toss of a coin. We can determine the probability for any genotype among the offspring of two heterozygotes, as explained in the text.

We can use our understanding of independent events to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. Two basic laws of probability that can help us in games of chance and in solving genetic problems are the rule of multiplication and the rule of addition.

The Rule of Multiplication

What is the chance that two coins tossed simultaneously will land heads up? More generally, how do we determine the chance that two or more independent events will occur together in some specific combination? The solution is in computing the probability for each independent event, then multiplying these individual probabilities to obtain the overall probability of these events occurring together. By this rule of multiplication, the probability that both coins will land heads up is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4. An F1 monohybrid cross is analogous to this game of chance. With flower color in pea plants as the heritable character, the genotype of a given F1 plant is Pp. What is the probability that a particular F2 plant will have white flowers? For this to happen, both the ovum and the sperm must carry the p allele, so we invoke the rule of multiplication. Segregation in the heterozygous plant is like flipping a coin. The probability that an ovum will have the p allele is 1/2. The chance that a sperm will have the p allele is 1/2. Thus, the probability that two p alleles will come together at fertilization is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4, equivalent to the probability that two independently tossed coins will land heads up (see the Punnett square in FIGURE 14.8).

We can also apply the rule of multiplication to dihybrid crosses, such as the one shown in FIGURE 14.7b. For a parent with the genotype YyRr, the probability that a gamete will carry the Y and R alleles is 1/4. We can use the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of specific genotypes in the F2 generation without having to construct a 16-part Punnett square. For example, the probability of an F2 plant having the genotype YYRR is 1/16 (1/4 chance for a YR ovum &#160;X&#160; 1/4 chance for a YR sperm). This corresponds to the top box in the Punnett square of FIGURE 14.7b.

The Rule of Addition

What is the probability that an F2 plant from a monohybrid cross will be heterozygous? Notice in FIGURE 14.8 that there are two ways F1 gametes can combine to produce a heterozygous result. The dominant allele can come from the ovum and the recessive allele from the sperm, or vice versa. By the rule of addition, the probability of an event that can occur in two or more different ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of those ways. Using this rule, we can calculate the probability of an F2 heterozygote as 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Using Rules of Probability to Solve Genetics Problems

We can combine the rules of multiplication and addition to solve complex problems in Mendelian genetics. For instance, imagine a cross of two pea varieties that differ in three characters--a trihybrid cross. Suppose we cross a trihybrid with purple flowers and yellow, round seeds (heterozygous for all three genes) with a plant with purple flowers and green, wrinkled seeds (heterozygous for flower color but homozygous recessive for the other two characters). Using Mendelian symbols, our cross is
PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr

Let's use the rules of probability to calculate the fraction of offspring predicted to exhibit the recessive phenotypes for atleast two of the three traits. We can start by listing all genotypes that fulfill this condition: ppyyRr, ppYyrr, Ppyyrr, PPyyrr, and ppyyrr. (Because the condition is at least two recessive traits, this last genotype, which produces all three recessive phenotypes, counts.) Next, we use the rule of multiplication to calculate the probability for each of these genotypes from our PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr cross (that is, we multiply the individual probabilities for the allele pairs). Finally, we use the rule of addition to pool the probabilities for fulfilling the condition of at least two recessive traits as shown at the top of the next column.

ppyyRr&#188; (probability of PP) &#160;X&#160;&#189; (yy) &#160;X&#160; (Rr)= 1/16ppYyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16Ppyyrr&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 2/16PPyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16ppyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16 Chance of at least two recessive traits= 6/16 or 3/8With practice, you'll be able to apply the rules of probability to solve genetics problems faster than you could by filling in Punnett squares.
