WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The United States and allied countries made `` solid gains '' in efforts to control narcotics trafficking in 1998 , the State Department said today , citing progress in crop reduction , drug interdiction and other areas .
In its annual report on the illicit drug trade worldwide , the department said the most encouraging development in 1998 was the continued downward trend in illicit coca cultivation .
`` The total coca crop remains at its lowest level in 10 years , even factoring in a sharp rise in cultivation in Colombia , '' the report said .
Separately , President Clinton was issuing his assessment of the counterdrug performance of 28 countries considered major sources of illicit narcotics or transit points for narcotics shipments .
Clinton has signaled his intention to `` certify '' Mexico as being fully cooperative with U.S. counternarcotics activities despite a reduction in narcotics seizures and other setbacks in the drug war last year .
Countries found not to be fully cooperative are `` decertified '' and can face economic sanctions .
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R - Miss. , indicated there may be a Senate move to overturn Clinton 's expected endorsement of Mexico 's counterdrug efforts .
White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey said Thursday that refusing to certify Mexico as a fully cooperating partner in the fight against drug trafficking would send an unwise and wrongheaded political message .
Jeffrey Davidow , U.S. ambassador to Mexico , said the United States appreciates Mexico 's efforts .
`` Acting alone , we cannot face , we cannot confront and beat the narcotics traffickers .
We have to do this in a cooperative fashion , '' he said .
Eight countries were decertified last year : Colombia , Cambodia , Pakistan , Paraguay , Afghanistan , Burma , Iran and Nigeria .
The first four were given a presidential waiver on national security grounds and therefore were not subject to sanctions .
In December , Iran was removed from the list of drug problem countries because of an ambitious campaign against the opium poppy , from which heroin is produced .
The State Department study , titled International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , said overall coca cultivation in the Andean countries fell 17 percent to 471,000 acres last year .
`` The most dramatic decline was evident in Peru , once the world 's largest coca producer , '' the report said .
`` Peruvian coca cultivation in 1998 fell 26 percent from the year before , and is now 60 percent below the peak level of 1990 , '' it said .
The massive 733-page document also evaluates the illicit narcotics situation country-by-country .
It said Colombia remained the world 's leading producer and distributor of cocaine and is a major source of heroin and marijuana .
A combined U.S. - Colombian eradication program had its best year ever in 1998 , successfully spraying over 160,000 acres of coca , an increase of 50 percent over 1997 .
Nonetheless , overall product increased because of stepped-up cultivation , the report said .
According to the report , Mexico continues to be the primary route for northbound South American cocaine and is a major source of marijuana , heroin and methamphetamine .
Despite a comprehensive anti-drug strategy , the report said , cocaine seizures were down 35 percent and opium cultivation increased by 25 percent .
`` Persistent corruption at all levels of the justice sector and frequent changes in personnel have combined to hinder Mexico 's ability to meet the goals of its anti-drug strategy , '' the study said .
