MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Focused intently on their computer screens , experts at Russia 's Mission Control on Tuesday slowly guided the international space station toward a linkup with its control module , the Russian -made Zvezda .
Once the long-delayed station docks with Zvezda , it will be finally ready for its first crew , set to arrive in October .
But the space laboratory , a massive 16-nation project headed by the United States , will not be complete for another five years , after more than 40 space flights .
Officials said everything was in working order and that the automatic docking would take place early Wednesday morning , Moscow time .
Firing Zvezda 's jets several times over the weekend , space controllers brought the 24-ton cylindrical module into a stationary orbit and aligned the rest of the station -- currently made up of two components -- for a smooth approach .
Shortly after docking , Zvezda 's solar arrays will begin tracking the sun , and within a few days , its computers will take full control of maintaining the station 's orbit .
The piece is crucial for the station 's immediate future , providing living quarters and steering controls and distributing electricity .
Although the docking should be a routine procedure , Russia is taking extra precautions with Zvezda , which means `` star '' in Russian .
If anything goes awry , two Russian cosmonauts will go into space to do the job manually .
But that scenario is one Russia desperately wants to avoid .
The manual docking system the cosmonauts would use is the same one used in a 1997 test aboard the Mir space station , when a cargo ship went astray and collided with the orbiter , puncturing the hull .
Zvezda 's flawless launch on July 12 was a relief for both Russian and American space officials , who called it a major success for American - Russian space partnership .
Since the launch , Zvezda 's systems have been tested several times and ground controllers performed a simulated docking .
After two years of delays and some $ 3 billion in cost overruns because of problems on the Russian side , questions had arisen about Moscow 's reliability as a partner , particularly since Zvezda was the first module to be built solely by the Russians .
Some members of the U.S. Congress are questioning whether to fund NASA 's spending projections on the $ 60 billion project , particularly after the failed launches of two Mars missions last year .
But they expressed cautious optimism about the Zvezda launch .
A failed docking would be a major setback for the new station and could delay work on it for at least two more years , if not call the entire mission into doubt .
The station is now made up of the Zarya module , built by Russia with U.S. funds and launched in November 1998 , and the NASA -built Unity connecting chamber , launched in December 1998 .
The next major piece to be added is the U.S. -built Destiny science module , the center of the station 's research activity , due to be launched in January .
As the station expands , many of Zvezda 's functions will be taken over by other components , but it will remain the heart of the Russian segments .
Once the space station is complete , it will weigh about one million pounds and have six laboratories .
Russia has also been criticized for keeping the Mir station in orbit , though Russian space officials maintain the 14-year -old station is still useful .
