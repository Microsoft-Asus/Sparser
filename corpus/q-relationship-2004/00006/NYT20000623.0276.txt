WASHINGTON --
China is building its military forces but is unlikely to attack Taiwan for fear of undermining Beijing 's top priority of continued economic growth and garnering world prestige , according to a new Pentagon assessment released Friday .
From missile systems , to jet aircraft , naval vessels and ground forces , China is designing weapons to transform what is essentially a massive Third World military into a lean and modern fighting force , the study concluded .
Beijing in recent months has threatened war on Taiwan , which it considers a renegade province .
But the Pentagon report said China 's main national priority `` remains economic reform and development within an environment that is both peaceful and stable . ''
Both goals would be jeopardized if China were to start a military conflict with Taiwan , according to the assessment , which is the Pentagon 's annual report to Congress on China 's military potential .
If China were to attack Taiwan , `` China would have to be willing to accept the almost certain political , economic , diplomatic , and military costs that such a course of action would produce , '' the report said .
Like most government predictions about future behavior of foreign nations , the 20-page declassified summary of the report hedged its forecast , cautioning that U.S. analysts could n't conclusively rule out the possibility that China would use military force , either against Taiwan or the United States .
China 's military build up `` should not be discounted , '' it said .
China 's military dwarfs Taiwan 's .
China has 2.5-million service members .
Taiwan 's military , in contrast , has about 400,000 members .
A weapons count shows Beijing with an overwhelming edge in quantity , although Taipei 's military gear is more advanced , with much of it purchased from the United States .
-- China has 4,500 combat aircraft compared with about 400 for Taiwan .
-- The Chinese operate about 65 attack submarines , including five nuclear-powered subs , compared with four diesel submarines for Taiwan .
-- China has over 60 major surface warship while Taiwan has 40 .
-- China has nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile force capable of delivering either nuclear or conventionally armed warheads against Taiwan .
According to a separate assessment from CIA Director George Tenet , China is developing a new class of ballistic missiles capable of striking Taiwan .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In addition , China has received two modern , Russian -built destroyers ; it has purchased Su -30 Flanker bombers from Russia , with delivery slated within two years , and received a fourth Russian Kilo submarine</ENAMEX> But despite the numerical advantages , the report says , Chinese forces will have `` only a limited capability '' to conduct sustained offensive operations against Taiwan between now and 2005 , mainly because Beijing currently lacks the equipment and tactics to conduct an amphibious invasion of the island , the report said .
However , between 2010 to 2020 China could begin gaining a military qualitative edge over Taiwan , the report said .
The Pentagon 's report to Congress last year on the Chinese military concluded that barring intervention by the United States , China would defeat Taiwan in any armed conflict -- whether a naval blockade , missile attack , outright invasion or air superiority campaign .
This year 's report said Taiwan would need help fending off a blockade , but might be able to combat an air attack .
The new report did n't discuss whether Taiwan could repel an invasion .
This year 's report also did n't address the scenario of a potential massive Chinese rocket attack against Taiwan .
Earlier this week , independent China experts told a House panel that China 's military buildup threatened increased tensions for the foreseeable future with Taiwan and the United States .
`` Absent some systematic change in China , we can expect in the years ahead a steady level of military tension with Beijing , with the real possibility of a crisis , '' said Arthur Waldron , a China expert with the University of Pennsylvania .
Another grim warning came from Larry Wortzel , a former U.S. defense attachi posted in Beijing .
He said Beijing `` refuses to renounce the use of force to settle territorial disputes ; it continues to threaten the use of force against Taiwan ; and it has used force in the international arena on a number of occasions in the recent past . ''
Taiwan separated from the mainland after a lengthy civil war on the mainland between Chiang Kai -shek 's government and the Chinese Communist Party led by Mao Zedong .
When the war ended in 1949 , two million refugees fled to Taiwan .
The U.S. position since 1979 -- when Washington formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing -- has been that it recognizes the government in Beijing as the sole legal government of China and Taiwan as part of China .
The Clinton administration does not support independence for Taiwan and soft-peddles its public support for the island .
For example , U.S. Cabinet officials are prohibited from traveling to the island on official business .
