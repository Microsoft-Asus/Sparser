WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Trying to rebuild declining migratory fish stocks in Atlantic and Gulf waters , federal regulators announced new fishing restrictions today for shark , Atlantic tuna and so-called `` billfish , '' including marlin .
Years of overfishing has resulted in such a decline in the number of Atlantic migratory fish that environmentalists fear some species such as shark , swordfish and blue marlin could be threatened with extinction .
Chefs at some pricy restaurants in the Northeast last year said they would not serve swordfish because of the species ' dramatic decline .
The National Marine Fisheries Service announced today it will press in international negotiations for a 10-year recovery program for swordfish that would require a 27 percent reduction in swordfish landings .
By treaty , the United States ca n't set a quota on swordfish independently .
But the agency said it would move on its own to reduce commercial fishing for large coastal shark , imposing tougher quotas on the number of such sharks that may be caught as well as size limits on some species .
The new fish management plans apply to federal Atlantic waters and the Gulf of Mexico from Maine to Texas .
`` In an atmosphere of intensely competing interests , we have crafted what we think is a fair reflection of the public 's wishes while at the same time never losing sight of our goal to rebuild these species , '' said Terry Garcia , the Commerce Department 's assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere .
The fisheries service is part of the department .
The agency held off a decision on how to deal with the large number of juvenile swordfish that are killed each year as `` bycatch . ''
It had proposed closing an area in the Florida straights for three months out of the year to reduce juvenile catches .
But environmentalits said that was inadequate .
The agency said it would re-examine the issue and announce a plan later this that likely will require a larger area , including the Florida Keys , to be put off-limits to protect juvenile fish .
Over the past year , environmentalists have focused on the threat to swordfish , persuading some restaurants to ban the fish from their menus .
Last year , in a largely symbolic move , chefs from 27 of the country 's finest restaurants said they would keep the fish off the menu for a year .
`` The swordfish is emblematic of a lot of the problems that face fisheries , '' said Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental advocacy group .
`` The population is down to the lowest level ever recorded . ''
The agency 's management plan also would : --Require new restrictions on fishing for Atlantic yellowfin tuna and close some bluefin tuna fishries off the New Jersey coast druing the month of June .
--Adopt restrictions on fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna , along the lines of an international agreement reached last November , with a 20-year recovery goal .
--Further restrict recreational catches of shark .
The number of fish allowed to be caught would be reduced from two to one per day per vessel .
The agency backed off from a `` catch-and-release '' requirement because of opposition from fishermen .
--Add restrictions on landings of blue and white marlin and other so-called `` billfish '' by recreational fishermen .
Marlin stocks have declined to about a quarter of the numbers needed for long-term survival , leading to a ban on commercial catches a few years ago .
The number of some species of shark has declined by as much as 85 percent , according to marine biologists .
`` Hardest hit have been the large coastal sharks , '' said Sonja Fordham of the Center for Marine Conservation .
`` They are especially vulnerable to overfishing because they grow slowly , mature late and have a small number of young . ''
Swordfish populations have declined dramatically because too many young fish are being caught , biologists say .
The average size of a swordfish today is one-third of what it was 30 years ago , and as many as a third of the roughly 110,000 swordfish caught each year are juveniles killed as bycatch -- caught incidentally in the process of fishing for something else .
`` There is a serious bycatch problem '' with swordfish that the proposals that had been considered in draft plans did not adequately address the problem , said Kenneth Hinman , president of the National Coalition for Marine Conservation .
