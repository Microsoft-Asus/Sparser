MOVEMENT AND LOCOMOTION

 

 Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity



 

 Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement



 

 Physical support on land depends on adaptations of body proportions and posture



 

 Muscles move skeletal parts by contracting



 

 Interactions between myosin and actin generate force during muscle contractions



 

 Calcium ions and regulatory proteins control muscle contraction



 

 Diverse body movements require variation in muscle activity



Movement is a hallmark of animals. To catch food, an animal must either move through its environment or move the surrounding water or air past itself. Sessile animals such as sponges and many cnidarians stay put, but they wave tentacles that capture prey or use beating cilia to generate water currents that draw and trap small food particles (see Chapter 33). Most animals, however, are mobile and spend a considerable portion of their time and energy actively searching for food, as well as escaping from danger and looking for mates. Locomotion, or active travel from place to place, is our focus here.
