In many angiosperms, insects and other animals transfer pollen from one flower to female sex organs on another flower, which makes pollination less random than the wind-dependent pollination of most gymnosperms. However, some flowering plants <span class="Emphasis1">are</span> wind-pollinated, a characteristic especially common for plants that occur in dense populations, such as grasses and tree species in temperate forests.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">A flower is a specialized shoot with four circles of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 30.13</span>). Starting at the bottom of the flower are the <span class="Emphasis2">sepals,</span> which are usually green. They are modified leaves that enclose the flower before it opens (think of a rosebud). Above the sepals are the <span class="Emphasis2">petals,</span> brightly colored in most flowers. They aid in attracting insects and other pollinators. Flowers that are wind-pollinated generally lack bright-colored parts. The sepals and petals are sterile floral parts, meaning that they are not directly involved in reproduction. Within the ring of petals are the fertile sporophylls, the leaf-derived parts that produce spores. The two rings of sporophylls are the stamens and carpels. <span class="Emphasis2">Stamens</span> are the male reproductive organs, the sporophylls that produce microspores that give rise to male gametophytes. <span class="Emphasis2">Carpels</span> are the female sporophylls, the organs that make megaspores and their products, female gametophytes. A stamen consists of a stalk called the <span class="Emphasis2">filament</span> and a terminal sac, the <span class="Emphasis2">anther,</span> where pollen is produced. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky <span class="Emphasis2">stigma</span> that receives pollen. A <span class="Emphasis2">style</span> leads to the <span class="Emphasis2">ovary</span> at the base of the carpel. Protected within the ovary are the ovules, which develop into seeds after fertilization.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig30-13a','../fig/big/fig30-13a.jpg','fig30-13a');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig30-13a.jpg" alt="fig30-13a" name="myfig30-13a"></a><br>a.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig30-13b','../fig/big/fig30-13b.jpg','fig30-13b');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig30-13b.jpg" alt="fig30-13b" name="myfig30-13b"></a><br>b.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 30-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">The structure of a flower.

The carpel probably evolved from a seed-bearing leaf (sporophyll) that became rolled into a tube (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 30.14</span>). Some angiosperms, such as garden peas, have flowers with single carpels. Others, such as magnolias, have several separate carpels. Still other species, such as lilies, have two or more fused carpels, usually forming an ovary with multiple ovule-containing chambers.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig30-14','../fig/big/fig30-14.jpg','fig30-14');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig30-14.jpg" alt="fig30-14" name="myfig30-14"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 30-14.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Hypothesis for the origin of the carpel from a reproductive leaf (sporophyll).</span> The enclosure of ovules (and seeds) within an ovary may have resulted from the rolling of leaves bearing megasporangia on their margins.
