CEBU , The Philippines , April 5 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Finance ministers of the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- meet here today to seek innovative schemes for stable exchange rates and freer capital flows in the region .
According to the official agenda , the two-day meeting will be dominated by discussions on the current macro-economic issues and policies for supporting the freer flow of capital , the private sector participation in infrastructure development and promotion of financial and capital market development .
When APEC leaders met in Subic , the northern Philippines , last November , they called on their finance ministers to pursue concrete and practical measures to accelerate the development of domestic financial and capital markets in the region , and stimulate the private sector participation in infrastructure development .
Analysts said that the ministers will take off from the directives of APEC leaders to translate visions into action and encourage APEC members to take the lead in the Asia - Pacific region .
AS the lack of infrastructure was identified at the Subic meeting as a major constraint to growth in the region , greater private sector involvement in the infrastructure development is top on the agenda .
APEC members acknowledges the compelling need to mobilize private resources for infrastructure development in view of the huge financing requirement , which was placed at 1,500 billion U.S. dollars in East Asia alone in the next decade .
However , the shares of private-sector sponsorship and financing of infrastructure projects at present are still less than 10 percent of the total infrastructure investment .
`` This share must be raised .
This means increasing the supply of bankable infrastructure projects .
Private resources must also be mobilized by deepening and broadening domestic capital market , '' said Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo Friday .
Toward this direction , he said , the APEC working group has recommended the creation of innovative financing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border debt and equity exchanges .
In the spirit of the Subic meeting , APEC ministers may consider endorsing voluntary support of freer capital flows , they said .
Amid the Thai baht crisis and a recent rise in U.S. interest rates , the ministers ' meeting , which is also attended by central bankers , is expected to put the issue of exchange rate stability into sharp focus .
The desire for stable exchange rates will be one of the points highlighted in the ministers ' joint statement to be issued tomorrow , said Jeremias Paul , director of the international finance at the Philippine Department of Finance .
The statement is likely to note that the currency imbalances noted by Group 7 finance ministers in April 1995 have been corrected and will probably reaffirm the importance of pursuing macro-economic policies that will nurture stable capital flows and currency rates .
Last year , APEC members delivered their individual action plans to help reach the bloc 's goal of eliminating all barriers to trade and investment in the region by 2010 for developed members and 2020 for developing members .
The Cebu meeting will take one step further toward the bloc 's goal if the ministers can work out practical schemes for freer capital flows in the region , analysts said .
