WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The United States says it is concerned that Russia 's early warning defense against missile attack appears to be deteriorating .
However , State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday the end of the Cold War has reduced any chance of Russia launching missiles based on a defective warning system .
Moreover , he said the United States is following up an offer President Clinton made at the Moscow summit last September to exchange information on missile launches and early warning systems .
The United States and the Soviet Union mounted early warning systems during the Cold War to guard against a surprise missile attack .
This gave the two sides a chance to prepare for an attack and to retaliate if missiles were on their way .
A defective system would make it harder to sort out information and to decide what to do .
The Washington Post , in a report from Moscow on Wednesday , said Russia cannot replenish the array of satellites it needs to monitor U.S. missile silos and nuclear-armed submarines .
For several hours every day , the Post said , Russian military commanders cannot see any of the U.S. missile fields nor can they monitor the most dangerous threat to their own forces -- U.S. Trident submarines submerged in the world 's oceans .
The report quoted unidentified Russian and Western security analysts .
Asked about the article , Rubin said U.S. security interests kept him from discussing the capabilities of specific Russian systems .
But he said : `` We are concerned about the potential deterioration of Russia 's ballistic missile attack warning capabilities without referencing any specific systems . ''
