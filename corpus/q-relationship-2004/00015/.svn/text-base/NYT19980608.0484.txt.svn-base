The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday , June 9 : Manhattan is filled this week with world leaders attending a well-intentioned but misdirected U.N. conference on drugs .
With drugs more plentiful and cheaper than ever worldwide , the leaders are mostly extolling failed strategies to combat the problem .
Pino Arlacchi , the Italian official who heads the organization 's International Drug Control Program , is promising to eliminate coca leaf and opium poppies , the basis of cocaine and heroin , in 10 years .
Such claims get in the way of effective programs to reduce drug use .
Arlacchi 's proposal , which is likely to be approved , would attempt to cut drug cultivation by bringing roads , schools and other development to drug areas .
The notion sounds reasonable , and it is surely better to help farmers than to finance a militarized war on drugs , which has torn apart societies and built up some of the world 's most repressive armies .
But elements of Arlacchi 's plan are unrealistic and harmful .
Half the funding would supposedly come from drug-producing nations themselves , an unlikely prospect .
Arlacchi would also make partners out of such abusive and unreliable governments as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the military in Myanmar .
While there is a place for crop substitution , law enforcement , interdiction and other programs to cut drug supply , these steps rarely deliver promised results .
Where crop substitution has been successful , drug cultivation has simply moved next door .
The conference has seen a welcome increase in talk about the duties of drug-consuming countries , but its proposals are still tilted toward attacking supply .
Studies show that treatment programs are far more cost-effective than efforts overseas .
But it is politically safer to advocate fighting drugs abroad than treating addicts at home .
The United Nations kept off the program virtually all the citizens ' groups and experts who wanted to speak .
There is no discussion of some interesting new ideas such as harm reduction , which focuses on programs like needle exchanges and methadone that cut the damage drugs do .
Like previous U.N. drug conferences , this one seems designed primarily to recycle unrealistic pledges and celebrate dubious programs .
