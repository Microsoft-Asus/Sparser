ATHENS , January 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Greece Monday denied that there were plans for a tripartite meeting between the U.S. , Greek and Turkish leaders in Washington in April to discuss the relations between Athens and Ankara as well as the protracted Cyprus problem .
Speaking at a press briefing , Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that a tripartite meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton with the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey had not been brought up and had not been examined .
It was reported that the tripartite meeting would take place on the occasion of the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- in Washington in April .
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their disputes in the territorial waters , air space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem .
The U.S. has for years been trying to mediate between Greece and Turkey to resolve their differences , but has made little progress .
Analysts here believe that with the recent cancellation of plans by Cyprus to deploy the Russian -made S -300 anti- Aircraft missiles on the divided island , opportunities have come for Greece and Turkey to improve their strained relations and for the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to re-start their inter-communal talks .
