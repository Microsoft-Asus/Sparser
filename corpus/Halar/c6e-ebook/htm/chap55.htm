We can only estimate how many more currently exist. Some biologists believe that the number is about 10 million, but others estimate it to be between 30 million and 80 million. Some of the greatest concentrations of species are found in the tropics, where the scene in the photograph on this page is commonplace: tropical forests (such as the one in Ecuador shown here) being destroyed at an alarming rate to make room for and support a burgeoning human population</span>.</p><a name="para15"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">Throughout the biosphere, human activities are altering trophic structures, energy flow, chemical cycling, and natural disturbance--ecosystem processes on which we and other species depend. The amount of human-altered land surface is approaching 50% , and we use over half of all accessible surface fresh water. In the oceans, stocks of many fishes are being depleted by overharvest, and some of the most productive and diverse areas, such as coral reefs and estuaries, are being severely stressed. By some estimates, we are in the process of doing more damage to the biosphere and pushing more species toward extinction than the large asteroid that seems to have triggered the mass extinctions at the close of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago (see</span><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 25.6</span>). <span class="Emphasis1">Globally, the rate of species loss may be as much as 1,000 times higher than at any time in the past 100,000 years</span>.</p><a name="para16"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis1">In this chapter, we take a closer look at the biodiversity crisis and at the science of conservation biology. We will examine some of the research and conservation strategies biologists are using in attempts to slow the rate of species loss. Along the way, we will see that conservation biology relies on research at all levels of ecology, from populations to ecosystems and landscapes</span>.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
