 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers

Of the ten plant phyla in the taxonomic scheme adopted by this textbook (see TABLE 29.1), four are grouped as gymnosperms (see FIGURE 30.4). Three are relatively small phyla: Ginkgophyta, Cycadophyta, and Gnetophyta. Ginkgo biloba is the only extant species of phylum Ginkgophyta. It has fanlike leaves that turn gold and are deciduous in autumn (FIGURE 30.5). Gingko is the source of a popular over-the-counter herbal preparation that some people believe improves memory. Cycads (phylum Cycadophyta) superficially resemble palms, which are actually flowering plants (FIGURE 30.6). Phylum Gnetophyta consists of three genera that are very different in appearance (FIGURE 30.7). One, Welwitschia, has giant straplike leaves. Plants of the second genus, Gnetum, grow in the tropics as trees or vines. Ephedra (Mormon tea), the third genus of Gnetophyta, is a shrub of the American deserts.

Fig 30-5. Phylum Ginkgophyta: Ginkgo biloba. Also known as the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo is a popular ornamental tree in cities because it can tolerate air pollution and other environmental insults. The left photo illustrates the summer green leaf color, while the top inset shows the leaves in autumn gold. Female trees produce fleshy seeds (bottom inset) whose seed coats emit a repulsive (to humans, at least) odor as they decay. The rotting flesh produces some of the same organic acids found in rancid butter, skunk spray, and human body odor, so landscapers usually plant only male (pollen-producing) trees.

Fig 30-6. Phylum Cycadophyta: cycads. (a) The palm-like plants in this garden are actually cycads, which are gymnosperms (true palms are angiosperms). (b) Cycad seeds develop on the surfaces of sporophylls, specialized reproductive leaves. The sporophylls are packed closely together to form cones, as shown in this interior view of a female cone.

By far the largest of the four gymnosperm phyla is phylum Coniferophyta, the conifers. The term conifer (from the Latin conus, cone, and ferre, to carry) comes from the reproductive structure of these plants, the cone, which is a cluster of scalelike sporophylls. Pines, firs, spruces, larches, yews, junipers, cedars, cypresses, and redwoods all belong to this phylum of gymnosperms (FIGURE 30.8, p. 604). Many are large trees. Although there are only about 550 species of conifers, a few of those species dominate vast forested regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where the growing season is relatively short because of latitude or altitude.

Fig 30-8. Phylum Coniferophyta: A sampling of conifer diversity. (a) Douglas fir. Expansive stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominate this Oregon forest. "Doug fir" provides more timber than any other North American tree species. Uses for the wood include house framing, plywood production, pulpwood for paper, railroad ties, and boxes and crates. (b) Sequoia. This giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in California's Sequoia National Park dwarfs the tourists at the bottom of this scene. It weighs about 2,500 metric tons, equivalent to about 14 blue whales (the largest animals), or 40,000 people. (c) Cypress. The "Lone Cypress" (Cupressus macrocarpa) in Monterey, California, is one of the world's most photographed trees. (d) Pacific yew. The bark of Pacific yew (Taxa brevifolia) is a source of taxol, a compound used to treat women with ovarian cancer. The leaves of a European yew species produce a similar compound, which can be harvested without destroying the plants. And pharmaceutical companies are now refining techniques for synthesizing drugs with taxol-like properties. (e) Common juniper. The "berries" of the common juniper (Juniperus communis) are actually ovule-producing cones consisting of fleshy sporophylls. An extract from juniper "berries" gives gin its distinctive flavor. (f) A pine farm. This loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) farm in South Carolina is a clone of fast-growing trees cultivated from cell cultures that produce seedlings (inset). (g) Wollemia pine. A survivor of a conifer group once known only from fossils, the Wollemia pine (Wollemia nobilis) was discovered alive in 1994 in a national park only 150 kilometers from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The species has only 40 known individuals in two small groves. The inset compares the leaves of this "living fossil" with actual fossils.

Most conifers are evergreens, meaning they retain leaves throughout the year. Even during winter, a limited amount of photosynthesis occurs on sunny days. And when spring comes, conifers already have fully developed leaves that can take advantage of the sunnier days. However, some conifers have deciduous leaves that drop in the autumn. The dawn redwood and tamarack are two examples.

The needle-shaped leaves of some conifers, such as pines and firs, are adapted to dry conditions. A thick cuticle covers the leaf, and the stomata are located in pits, further reducing water loss.

We get much of our lumber and paper pulp from the wood of conifers. What we call wood is actually xylem tissue, which gives the tree structural support.

Coniferous trees are among the largest and oldest organisms on Earth. Redwoods, found only in a narrow coastal strip of northern California, grow to heights of more than 110 m; only certain eucalyptus trees in Australia are taller. Bristlecone pines, another species of California conifer, are among the oldest organisms alive. One bristlecone, named Methuselah, is more than 4,600 years old; it was a young tree when humans invented writing.
