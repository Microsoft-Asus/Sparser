JERUSALEM , June 21 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY-DEL">Israeli Police have smashed a Russian mafia , arresting 28 people suspected of crimes including forgery , drug trade and murders , the Jerusalem Post reported today .
Police described this as the biggest crime ring involving Russians uncovered in Israel .
Yossi Levy , head of police investigations , said most of the detained were connected to an international crime ring based in Russia that also operates in several European countries .</ENAMEX>
He was quoted as saying that Israeli police launched the crackdown with the help of their counterparts in several European states .
`` This is the first criminal ring connected to international crime in the Commonwealth of Independent States -LRB- CIS -RRB- that has been uncovered here , '' Levy said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY-DEL">The police preferred the term `` international crime '' to `` mafia , '' because the latter implies criminal activity that has penetrated the ruling establishment -- which is not the case in Israel , but is allegedly the case in the CIS .</ENAMEX>
The gang was suspected of engaging in bribery , fraud , and forgery , mainly connected to the distribution of illegal documents ranging from credit cards to Israel army 's discharge sheets , the report said .
They were also reported to be involved in many cases of murders , drug trade and prostitution .
Police said that the gang arranged fictitious marriages with Israeli women , mainly immigrants from the CIS , for CIS men who wanted to gain Israeli citizenship , often for criminal purposes .
The immigrant women were paid some 2,000 U.S. dollars to go abroad to marry the men .
Russian criminals regard Israel as a prime location for laundering money , and the Israeli citizenship make it easier for them to operate , police said .
The Israeli Interior Ministry , Military Police and Income Tax and Customs authorities are now increasing their cooperation in helping the investigation and preventing future crimes .
