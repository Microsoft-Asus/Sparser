The molecules that do all the work of being alive fall into a few, well-defined categories. The first is a set of very large and complex molecules called proteins. Proteins, working together in groups, are directly responsible for most of the remarkable things that living things can do, reshaping matter and energy to sustain life and create offspring. Each organism uses thousands of different proteins to go about its life. The ability of Radiodurans to survive so much radiation, or of Aspen groves to get energy from the sun, each depends on the activity of thousands of particular proteins. 

Proteins are interesting molecules, and later we will examine their structure and function in some detail. There are millions of different kinds of proteins in the world. The bacterium Synechococcus elongatus, a relatively simple autotroph, needs about 2500 proteins to do its work. Very complex organisms might make 100,000 different proteins, many of which are modest variants of each other. Each protein (a structure) has a specific function (or sometimes more than one) that it can accomplish. Proteins can be studied in isolation, but they usually work in groups. A useful metaphor is to think of proteins as basic commands in a computer programming language that can be combined in various ways to make all different sorts of software.

Proteins are very powerful and complex molecules, but they actually have a simple underlying structure: they are linear polymers. A polymer is a chemical compound that is made up of simpler units (called monomers) that are repeated many times, like LEGO blocks. The simple units in proteins are called amino acids. For most organisms there are about 20 different kinds of these pieces. The fact that proteins are a linear polymer just means that there is no branching or circles made with the parts: a protein can be thought of as a simple "chain" of amino acid "links."  Every protein can be described by enumerating, in order, the amino acids that make up its chain, called the protein's sequence. Most proteins contain between one hundred and one thousand amino acids. Protein chains are flexible, and the details of their sequences determine a characteristic three-dimensional shape that each protein folds up into. As described in detail in Section 5.1, the particular details of the sequence of amino acids and the resulting folded shape is what gives each protein its unique functional capabilities.
