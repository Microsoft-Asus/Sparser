NEW DELHI , March 31 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- India is looking into Japan 's concern over its restrictions on imports of auto spare parts , a senior government official said here Tuesday .
`` We have received the communication from the Japanese government about the automobile policy and are looking into it , '' said N. N. Khanna , Special Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce .
Reports from Tokyo said that Japan urged India to remove its `` local content requirement '' for foreign automakers because it violates fair trade rules set by the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- .
Japan is particularly peeved with India 's regulation that requires foreign automobile manufacturers to raise the indigenization level of their auto parts to 50 percent in three years and 70 percent in five years .
Officials from the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry said that the United States , European Union and South Korea were expected to join Japan to press India to justify these requirements at the WTO .
Khanna declined to comment on the threat by Japan , saying that it is nothing unusual for developing countries to protect their own market by imposing certain conditions to get products at a cheap price .
Major Japanese car companies including Toyota Motors , Honda and Suzuki have their manufacturing bases in India .
