BEIJING , December 11 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The world economy picked up in most regions in 1996 , although the all-round growth predicted by many failed to materialize .
Even so , the improvement in economic activity this year has laid a solid foundation for further gains in 1997 .
The U.S. economy , which has experienced continuous growth since 1991 , should see an increase in gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- of 2.4 percent resulting from higher consumption and investment , marked growth in exports and a reduction in its budget and foreign trade deficits , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasts .
After three years of erratic growth , the Japanese economy is forecast to see some revitalization following the government 's passing of a supplementary budget to spur growth .
Very low interest rates and the Japanese yen 's devaluation have also encouraged investment and exports .
Japan 's economy is expected to grow 3 percent this year , compared with 0.9 percent in 1995 .
Western European countries , which have been plagued by high interest rates over the past couple of years and suffered unstable exchange rates in 1995 , have suffered slow growth this year overall .
Economic growth in the 15-nation European Union is estimated at around 1.6 percent this year , a full 1 percentage point lower than in 1995 , although more stable exchange rates , lower medium and short-term interest rates and higher exports this year helped Germany , the driving force in the EU economy , to recover from stagnation .
Economic activity in developing countries remained impressive , with Asia still leading the world with annual growth of 7.3 percent in 1996 .
But the momentum has slowed as austerity policies to avoid overheating and excessive inflation have put the brakes on high growth rates .
The African economy , which is highly diverse , saw generally sound development in 1996 , with growth up 3 percent over 1995 and forecasts of further improvement in 1997 of 4.5 percent .
Some countries entered a new phase of steady development after adopting reform and readjustment policies .
In Latin America , economic growth for 1996 is estimated at 3 percent , as Mexico emerged successfully from its financial crisis in 1994 and 1995 and Argentina pulled out of recession .
The economies of central and eastern European countries , which have been going through dramatic economic and social changes , recorded 0.4 percent growth in 1996 after five consecutive years of decline .
However , most of the former republics of the Soviet Union , including Russia , saw a continued , albeit slower , slide in their economies .
Economists have long advocated a strategy of `` non-inflationary economic growth , '' which has also been pursued by many governments .
Such an ideal , however , is hard to achieve .
One approach has been to follow a policy of growth with low inflation , which has proved possible in some countries .
The inflation rate in many developed countries was kept below 3 percent in 1996 , while most developing countries succeeded in controlling inflation at 13.3 percent on average , compared with 19.8 percent in 1995 .
In Asia , inflation has been kept between 5 and 6 percent and in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe it has been cut from three-digit levels in 1995 to two-digit growth this year .
This trend of economic development with low inflation is expected to continue in the future .
Still , there are many problems standing in the way of economic development for many countries and regions .
While the United States faces a huge budget deficit , increasing family debt and growing disparity in incomes , Japan is still overshadowed by economic recession , reforms of its industrial structure have not been completed , and huge bad loan liabilities have fettered banks ' ability to provide loans .
Many European Union countries are faced with the dual problems of two-digit high unemployment rates and the effects of austerity policies now in place meet the tough budget deficit , debt and inflation criteria outlined in the Maastricht Treaty , which sets out the conditions for EU monetary union .
In Asia , the slowdown in export growth and the lack of adequate infrastructure and energy supplies which tend to accompany rapid economic development , pose a major challenge for the region .
Africa , which is thirsty for foreign capital , is suffering from an unbalanced economic structure and unstable political situations in some regions , while Latin America faces the challenge of stabilizing its financial system and sharpening its competitiveness in international markets to maintain its growth momentum .
Eastern European countries , having experienced social and economic upheavals , have yet to reform their financial systems , and political uncertainty still exists in some of these countries .
But in spite of these unfavorable factors , most authoritative agencies are optimistic about the prospects for the world economy in 1997 , believing that it is about to enter a new phase of high speed development .
An autumn report from the International Monetary Fund said the world economy in 1996 is expected to grow by 3.8 percent , up 0.3 percentage points over last year , and predicts a 4.1 percent rise in 1997 .
The economies of Russia and other CIS states are also expected to recover next year .
The agencies say many positive factors exist for sustainable economic development .
They include much more active direct investment around the globe by multinational companies , growing trade liberalization , stabilization of the world financial market , stable exchange rates between the major currencies , more fruitful readjustment and development policies and strategies and better regional cooperation .
If these predictions are realized , the world economy is likely to see healthy growth and development in 1997 .
