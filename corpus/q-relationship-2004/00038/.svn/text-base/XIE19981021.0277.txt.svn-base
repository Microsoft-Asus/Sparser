WASHINGTON , October 20 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- The United States and South Korea have reached an agreement over access to the Asian country 's auto market , averting the threat of U.S. sanctions on South Korean car imports , the United States announced Tuesday .
`` The agreement announced this evening in Washington averts the imposition of trade sanctions , '' announced U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in a statement .
This also provides `` substantial opportunities for U.S. automakers by dismantling a range of discriminatory Korean trade barriers in the near term and by establishing a solid basis for steady improvement in the future , '' Barshefsky said .
In her statement , Barshefsky said the agreement with South Korea substantially improved on a deal signed in 1995 which U.S. manufacturers had previously complained about .
The new deal broadened the range of cars covered by the previous agreement to include minivans and sports utility vehicles .
It also addressed burdensome certification procedures in South Korea .
Furthermore , under the agreement , South Korea will also cut car taxes substantially , bind car import tariffs to a maximum eight percent of value , introduce a system to help Koreans finance car purchases more easily and promise to improve the image of foreign cars .
Last year , the U.S. cited South Korea under the so-called Super 301 provisions of its trade law , which directs the administration to identify foreign trade practices that hurt U.S. exports .
