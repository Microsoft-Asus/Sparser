 Mendelian inheritance has its physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles

Using improved microscopy techniques, cytologists worked out the process of mitosis in 1875 and meiosis in the 1890s. Then, around 1900, cytology and genetics converged as biologists began to see parallels between the behavior of chromosomes and the behavior of Mendel's factors. For example, chromosomes and genes are both present in pairs in diploid cells, homologous chromosomes separate and alleles segregate during meiosis, and fertilization restores the paired condition for both chromosomes and genes. Around 1902, Walter S. Sutton, Theodor Boveri, and others independently noted these parallels, and a chromosome theory of inheritance began to take form. According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci on chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment (FIGURE 15.1, p. 270).

Fig 15-1. The chromosomal basis of Mendel's laws. Here we correlate the results of one of Mendel's dihybrid crosses (see FIGURE 14.7b) with the behavior of chromosomes. The arrangement of chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis and their movement during anaphase I account for the segregation and independent assortment of the alleles for seed color and shape. Because the alternatives at metaphase I are equally likely, F1 plants produce equal numbers of four kinds of gametes.
