But a gene does not build a protein directly. The bridge between DNA and protein synthesis is RNA. You learned in Chapter 5 that RNA is chemically similar to DNA, except that it contains ribose instead of deoxyribose as its sugar and has the nitrogenous base uracil rather than thymine (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.29</span>). Thus, each nucleotide along a DNA strand has deoxyribose as its sugar and A, G, C, or T as its base; each nucleotide along an RNA strand has ribose as its sugar and A, G, C, or U as its base. An RNA molecule almost always consists of a single strand.</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">It is customary to describe the flow of information from gene to protein in linguistic terms because both nucleic acids and proteins are polymers with specific sequences of monomers that convey information, much as specific sequences of letters communicate information in a language like English. In DNA or RNA, the monomers are the four types of nucleotides, which differ in their nitrogenous bases. Genes are typically hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long, each gene having a specific sequence of bases. Each polypeptide of a protein also has monomers arranged in a particular linear order (the protein’s primary structure), but its monomers are the 20 amino acids. Thus, nucleic acids and proteins contain information written in two different chemical languages. To get from DNA, written in one language, to protein, written in the other, requires two major stages, transcription and translation.</p><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Transcription</span> is the synthesis of RNA under the direction of DNA. Both nucleic acids use the same language, and the information is simply transcribed, or copied, from one molecule to the other. Just as a DNA strand provides a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand during DNA replication, it provides a template for assembling a sequence of RNA nucleotides. The resulting RNA molecule is a faithful transcript of the gene’s protein-building instructions. This type of RNA molecule is called <span class="Emphasis2">messenger RNA (mRNA),</span> because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein-synthesizing machinery of the cell (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.2a</span>). (Transcription is the general term for the synthesis of <span class="Emphasis1">any</span> kind of RNA on a DNA template. Later in this chapter, you will learn about other types of RNA produced by transcription.)</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig17-2','../fig/big/fig17-2.jpg','fig17-2');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig17-2.jpg" alt="fig17-2" name="myfig17-2"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 17-2.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Overview: the roles of transcription and translation in the flow of genetic information.</span> In a cell, inherited information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The two main stages of information flow are transcription and translation. In transcription, a gene provides the instructions for synthesizing a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. In translation, the information encoded in mRNA determines the order of amino acids that are joined to form a specific polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes. A miniature version of part b (or sometimes part a) accompanies several figures later in the Chapter as an orientation diagram to help you see where a particular figure fits into the overall scheme.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Translation</span> is the actual synthesis of a polypeptide, which occurs under the direction of mRNA. During this stage, there is a change in language: The cell must translate the base sequence of an mRNA molecule into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes, complex particles that facilitate the orderly linking of amino acids into polypeptide chains.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">Although the basic mechanics of transcription and translation are similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there is an important difference in the flow of genetic information within the cells. Because bacteria lack nuclei, their DNA is not segregated from ribosomes and the other protein-synthesizing equipment. Transcription and translation are coupled, with ribosomes attaching to the leading end of an mRNA molecule while transcription is still in progress (see FIGURE 17.22). In a eukaryotic cell, by contrast, the nuclear envelope separates transcription from translation in space and time (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 17.2b</span>). Transcription occurs in the nucleus, and mRNA is dispatched to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. But before they can leave the nucleus, eukaryotic RNA transcripts are modified in various ways to produce the final, functional mRNA. Thus, in a two-step process, the transcription of a eukaryotic gene results in <span class="Emphasis1">pre-mRNA,</span> and <span class="Emphasis2">RNA processing</span> yields the finished mRNA. A more general term for an initial RNA transcript is <span class="Emphasis2">primary transcript.</span></p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s summarize the main point of our overview of protein synthesis: Genes program protein synthesis via genetic messages in the form of messenger RNA.
