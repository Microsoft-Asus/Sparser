SAN FRANCISCO --
The new Power Mac G4 `` supercomputer '' may not be that super after all .
And Steve Jobs ' use of that term to describe his company 's newest desktop computer is making some waves in the industry .
Jobs , the interim chief executive officer of Apple Computer Inc. , made a big splash Tuesday when he unveiled the machine in San Francisco before a packed auditorium of Mac enthusiasts .
From the stage , Jobs announced that the machine was `` by definition '' a supercomputer .
Apple 's Web site also proclaims that the machine sports a `` supercomputer on a chip . ''
A coming advertising campaign hammers home the theme , portraying the new pearly white and gray machine as some kind of secret weapon , guarded by a circle of military tanks .
The ad plays off what Jobs said was an apparent warning the company received from the federal government , which cautioned that the G4 was so powerful it could not be imported to `` sensitive countries . ''
Some computer industry analysts say that Jobs ' assertion that the G4 is a supercomputer is based on a dated government definition enacted to control technology exports to hostile countries .
According to Jobs , the G4 is a supercomputer because it runs at the `` gigaflop '' level .
A computer running at a speed of 1 gigaflop can perform roughly 1 billion calculations per second .
`` Flop '' is short for `` floating-point operations per second . ''
A gigaflop of power is roughly equal in computing to four 400 Mhz Intel processors .
But that definition of a supercomputer has been long outdated , said Karen Green , a spokeswoman with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications , a National Science Foundation computer research agency based at the University of Illinois campus in Champaign - Urbana .
`` Steve Jobs is a very , very clever man , '' Green said .
`` But he 's using an old standard that people in the field know just is n't correct anymore . ''
Phil Schiller , the vice president of worldwide product marketing for Apple , said the `` supercomputer '' label was valid .
He said Apple 's claim was based on the government export restriction definition as well as the use of the gigaflop standard to describe the performance of supercomputers built by other companies , such as Silicon Graphics Inc. and its subsidiary , the Cray supercomputing unit .
`` For the majority of supercomputers today , the gigaflop is the measure of performance , '' Schiller said .
With the G4 , Schiller said , `` people can get into the entry level of super computering .
That is true . ''
Richard Crandall , who holds the title of `` distinguished scientist '' at Apple , argues that the `` super '' label can be rightfully attached to the G4 because it is the fastest computer available commercially .
But according to Green and other computer specialists , supercomputers have , for the last several years , been running at the `` terra-flop '' level -- 1 trillion calculations per second .
The U.S. Department of Energy uses terraflop machines to calculate long-range global warming forecasts and to make predictions about oil and gas depletion .
`` Gigaflops is n't that fast any more , '' said National Science Foundation spokesman Peter West .
`` It 's a standard from way , way back . ''
Jobs ' definition of supercomputer seems to be derived from export restriction rules set by the Department of Commerce in 1996 .
Those rules maintained that 1-gigaflop machines would be subject to export controls , the better to prevent hostile countries from using them .
The 1-gigaflop export restrictions , however , have long been left in the dust by technological advances .
Now , someone with a modicum of computer engineering education and a soldering iron can cobble together a 1-gigaflop machine from cheap computer parts .
The White House , following lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley , has asked Congress to approve Commerce Department guidelines that increase the supercomputer power definition to a little more than 3 gigaflops .
That change is expected to be approved by Jan. 23 , 2000 , months after Apple 's `` supercomputer '' ad campaign takes hold .
No matter .
`` It was just a marketing play anyway , '' said Lou Mazzucchelli , an Apple analyst who is quick to add that the G4 was still the `` biggest , baddest machine '' in the world of desktop computing .
`` It 's probably more accurate to say the G4 is a vintage supercomputer , '' Mazzucchelli said .
