MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- On a sad day for the Russian space program , the crew of the Mir space station prepared today to head back to Earth and leave the orbiter unmanned in preparations for its abandonment next year .
`` The mood here is businesslike , but gloomy , '' said Valery Lyndin , the spokesman for the Mission Control center in the town of Korolyov near Moscow .
Russian cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev , along with French astronaut Jean - Pierre Haignere , are scheduled to move from the station to the Soyuz escape capsule later today .
They are to depart from the station at 1 : 14 a.m. local time Saturday and land about three hours later in a deserted steppe in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan .
The decision to abandon the 13-year -old Mir , by far the world 's longest-serving space station , came after the cash-strapped government decided to stop financing its operation and all attempts to attract private funds failed .
In a last-ditch effort to raise cash , the state-run RKK Energia company that owns the Mir , decided to postpone discarding the ship for good until early next year .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Few believe that money will be found , meaning that the government will have to pay for a final mission to the Mir in late February or March to safely discard it .</ENAMEX>
If that happens , a crew of two will spend about a month aboard the station , gradually lowering its orbit .
Right after the cosmonauts leave , ground controllers will send the 140-ton station to burn up in the atmosphere , with any surviving fragments falling into the Pacific Ocean .
Mission Control has dismissed fears that the deserted Mir may spin out of control and crash on land .
`` The Mir 's command system is reliably backed up to guarantee it from failure , '' Lyndin said .
Shortly after the crew leaves , Mission Control will switch off most of the Mir 's systems , including the central computer that keeps the station 's solar panels facing the sun .
However , there will be enough energy left to restart the computer , Lyndin said .
The station 's climate control system will keep the station from freezing , he added .
At the same time , another official warned that no funds have been earmarked yet to build the two booster rockets necessary to take the final crew to the Mir and deliver a cargo ship that would push the station into the atmosphere .
`` There is still no money for that , and Energia is seriously concerned because it bears responsibility for the safe discarding of the station , '' said Yuri Grigoryev , Energia 's deputy chief , according to the ITAR - Tass news agency .
The Mir has had a patchy safety record that includes a fire , a near-fatal collision with a cargo ship and numerous computer breakdowns , but it has been running relatively smoothly in recent months .
The U.S. space agency NASA has long urged Russia to bring the Mir down and concentrate its scarce resources on a new international space station that is behind schedule because of Moscow 's failure to build key components .
But Russian space officials and cosmonauts have been reluctant to part with the Mir , the last symbol of the nation 's once-glorious space program .
They fear that without a space project of its own , Russia will be left playing second fiddle to the United States in the new station .
