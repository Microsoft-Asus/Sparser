WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- The State Department and the CIA are looking into a possible Cuban connection in the U.S. drug trade , with water and air space lightly patrolled by Fidel Castro 's government offering a tempting route for Colombian cocaine and heroin .
But for Castro , who has been portraying himself as an effective warrior against drug trafficking , the latest concern mixes the message from Washington .
Hours after the Senate voted earlier this month to ease restrictions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba , anti- Castro Republicans scored a victory in their quest to focus a spotlight on use of Cuban waters by drug barons .
They convinced the Clinton administration to look into an abortive cocaine shipment intended to go through Cuban waters last December .
There is no suggestion that the Cuban government itself had any involvement with the shipment .
Cuba has vowed to pursue the drug war vigorously .
Three weeks ago , Castro even invited the United States to join him in an anti-drug campaign so the two countries could become `` one of the greatest alliances against drug trafficking . ''
Gen. Barry McCaffrey , director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , acknowledges that traffickers have been making increased use of Cuban air space and territorial waters .
But , he notes , Cuba maintains it does not have the resources to patrol these large areas , especially its territorial waters .
`` There is no conclusive evidence to indicate that Cuban leadership is currently involved in this criminal activity , '' McCaffrey says .
Castro 's detractors object even to the limited U.S. - Cuban anti-drug cooperation now in place , saying the evidence suggests an official Cuban role in supporting drug trafficking .
Rep. Ileana Ros - Lehtinen said it is preposterous for the administration to give Castro credibility on the drug issue , contending the Cuban leader is notorious for helping drug traffickers .
Similar objections were raised by Rep. Lincoln Diaz - Balart , who , like Ros - Lehtinen , is a Cuban -born South Florida Republican .
But congressional critics of the embargo are showing surprising strength of late .
The Senate vote to ease restrictions on the sale of food and medicine represented a rare defeat for anti- Castro hardliners .
It was a victory for farm groups eager for an expansion of U.S. markets abroad .
Two Democratic senators from farm states , Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota , led a U.S. delegations for talks over the weekend with the Castro government .
Impetus for the inquiry into a Cuban drug connection came with a House committee report on the seizure of a 7.5-ton cocaine shipment by Colombia 's narcotics police .
According to the report , a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official told investigators that `` in all likelihood the Dec. 3 shipment of cocaine to Cuba was eventually meant to transit through Mexico and on to the U.S. '' Cuba says the shipment was earmarked for Spain .
The State Department initially agreed but now is not so sure .
Earlier in August , on the day after the Senate vote on easing the embargo , the State Department asked the CIA to `` conduct an all-source review of intelligence community and law enforcement community data to shed further light on the ultimate destination of this shipment . ''
A CIA finding that the shipment was intended to reach U.S. markets after passing through Cuban waters could lead to Cuba 's placement on the so-called `` Major 's List '' of drug trafficking countries .
Castro 's opponents in Congress are pushing for the State Department to apply that designation to Cuba .
That would subject Cuba , much like Colombia and Mexico , to a State Department evaluation of its anti-drug performance each year .
Countries found to have lax counterdrug programs can be subject to sanctions .
Such a finding would have no impact on Cuba , which is already under comprehensive sanctions .
Still , it would be a blow to Castro 's efforts to build an anti-drug image .
It also could be used as a weapon by his U.S. critics , many of whom suspect the Clinton administration is seeking cozier relations with the island .
The campaign for Cuba 's inclusion on the list is being led by the chairman of the House International Relations Committee , Rep. Benjamin Gilman , R - N.Y. , and the chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee , Dan Burton , R - Ind .
Being on the list , which has 28 countries , does not imply that the government in question is working with traffickers .
Virtually all Andean countries plus Mexico are on the list .
As of the most recent State Department evaluation , all were `` certified '' as fully cooperating with U.S. counternarcotics efforts .
