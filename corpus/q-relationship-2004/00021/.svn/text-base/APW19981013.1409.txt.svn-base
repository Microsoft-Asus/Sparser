-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The chairman of the U.N. committee overseeing sanctions against Libya suggested some flexibility in the measures following continued violations of the U.N. flight ban , diplomatic sources said .
In a closed Security Council meeting on Tuesday , Danilo Turk of Slovenia suggested the sanctions committee consider being more willing to approve requests for a waiver of the ban by heads of state who want to fly into Libya , the diplomats said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
There was no indication that the committee would approve the suggestion , or that the idea would even be formally proposed .
There is , however , widespread concern within the Security Council that its authority is being undermined by continued violations of the flight ban , particularly by African nations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">The Organization of African Unity announced in June that it would no longer abide by the air embargo</ENAMEX> .
There have been several violations since then .
Earlier this month , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi presented 11 African leaders with medals of honor in appreciation for violating the embargo .
The U.N. committee allowed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to fly to Tripoli in July , but the committee waiver was believed to have been based on humanitarian grounds because Mubarak was flying with a medical team to check on the health of Gadhafi , who had recently undergone a hip operation .
In an effort to end the violations , Turk met with the ambassadors of Mali , Niger and Chad , whose countries had all recently violated the ban .
Turk told the council on Tuesday that he had received letters from each of their governments stating that yes , <ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">they had indeed violated the embargo , but did so because the OAU said they could</ENAMEX> , the diplomats said .
Turk 's suggestion came as part of a general discussion to try to figure out a way to preserve the integrity of the ban , diplomats said .
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions that ban direct flights to and from Libya in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people .
The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according to Scottish law in the Netherlands .
