Caterpillars feed on plant leaves, and <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.10</span> is a simplified diagram of how the energy a caterpillar obtains from food is partitioned. Out of 200 J (48 cal) consumed by a caterpillar, only about 33 J (one-sixth) is used for growth. The caterpillar passes the rest as feces or uses it for cellular respiration. The energy contained in the feces is not lost from the ecosystem, as it will be consumed by detritivores. However, the energy used for respiration is lost from the ecosystem as heat. Energy pours into an ecosystem as solar radiation and drains away as respiratory heat loss. This is why energy is said to flow through, not cycle within, ecosystems. Only the chemical energy stored as growth (or the production of offspring) by herbivores is available as food to secondary consumers. And our example actually overestimates the conversion of primary production to secondary production because we did not account for all the plant material that herbivores do not even consume. The greenness of terrestrial landscapes due to an abundance of plant material indicates that most net primary production is not converted over the short term to secondary production.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig54-10','../fig/big/fig54-10.jpg','fig54-10');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig54-10.jpg" alt="fig54-10" name="myfig54-10"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 54-10.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Energy partitioning within a link of the food chain.</span> Less than 17%  of the caterpillar’s food is actually converted to caterpillar biomass.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText">If we view animals as energy transformers, we can ask questions about their relative efficiencies.

Assimilation consists of the total energy taken in and used for growth, reproduction, and respiration. In other words, <span class="Emphasis2">production efficiency</span> is the fraction of food energy that is <span class="Emphasis1">not</span> used for respiration. For the caterpillar in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.10</span>, production efficiency is 33% ; 67 J of the 100 J of assimilated energy is used for respiration (note that energy lost as undigestible material in feces does not count as assimilation). Birds and mammals have low production efficiencies, ranging from 1-3% , because they use so much energy to maintain a warm body temperature. Fishes, which are ectotherms (see Chapter 40), have a production efficiency around 10% . Insects are even more efficient, with production efficiencies averaging 40% .</p><p class="Header3">Trophic Efficiency and Ecological Pyramids</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Let’s scale up now from the production efficiencies of individual consumers to the flow of energy through whole trophic levels.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Trophic efficiency</span> is the percentage of production transferred from one trophic level to the next. Put another way, trophic efficiency is the fraction of net production at one trophic level as a percent of net production at the level below. Trophic efficiencies must always be less than production efficiencies because they take into account not only the energy lost through respiration and materials in feces, but also the energy in organic material in a lower trophic level that is not consumed by the next trophic level. Trophic efficiencies usually range from 5-20% , depending on the type of ecosystem. In other words, 80-95%  of the energy available at one trophic level never transfers to the next. And this loss is multiplied over the length of a food chain. If 10%  of energy is transferred from primary producers to primary consumers, and 10%  of that energy is transferred to secondary consumers, then only 1%  of net primary production is available to secondary consumers (10%  of 10% ).</p><a name="para06"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Pyramids of Production.</span> This multiplicative loss of energy from a food chain can be represented by a <span class="Emphasis2">pyramid of production,</span> in which the trophic levels are stacked in blocks, with primary producers forming the foundation of the pyramid.

Most biomass pyramids narrow sharply from primary producers at the base to top-level carnivores at the apex because energy transfers between trophic levels are so inefficient (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.12a</span>). Some aquatic ecosystems, however, have inverted biomass pyramids, with primary consumers outweighing producers. In the waters of the English Channel, for example, the biomass of zooplankton (consumers) is five times the weight of phytoplankton (producers) (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.12b</span>). Such inverted biomass pyramids occur because the zooplankton consume the phytoplankton so quickly that the producers never develop a large population size, or standing crop. Instead, the phytoplankton grow, reproduce, and are consumed rapidly. Phytoplankton have a short <span class="Emphasis2">turnover time,</span> which means they have a small standing crop biomass compared to their production: <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM54-4.gif"> Because the phytoplankton continue to replace their biomass at such a rapid rate, they can support a biomass of zooplankton bigger than their own biomass. Nevertheless, the pyramid of <span class="Emphasis1">production</span> for this ecosystem is upright, like the one in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.11</span>, because phytoplankton have a much higher production than zooplankton.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig54-12','../fig/big/fig54-12.jpg','fig54-12');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig54-12.jpg" alt="fig54-12" name="myfig54-12"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 54-12.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Pyramids of biomass (standing crop).</span> Numbers denote the dry weight (g/m<SUP>2</SUP>) for all organisms at a trophic level.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para08"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="Emphasis2">Pyramids of Numbers.</span> The multiplicative loss of energy from food chains severely limits the overall biomass of top-level carnivores that any ecosystem can support. Only about one one-thousandth of the chemical energy fixed by photosynthesis can flow all the way through a food web to a tertiary consumer, such as a hawk, snake, or shark (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.11</span>). This explains why food webs usually include only about four or five trophic levels (see Chapter 53).</p><a name="para09"></a><p class="BlockText">Because predators are usually larger than the prey they eat, top-level predators tend to be fairly large animals. Thus, the limited biomass at the top of an ecological pyramid is concentrated in a relatively small number of large individuals. This phenomenon is reflected in a <span class="Emphasis2">pyramid of numbers,</span> in which the size of each block is proportional to the number of individual organisms present in each trophic level (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 54.13</span>). Populations of top predators are typically small, and the animals may be widely spaced within their habitats. As a result, many predators are highly susceptible to extinction (as well as to the evolutionary consequences of small population size discussed in Chapter 23).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig54-13','../fig/big/fig54-13.jpg','fig54-13');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig54-13.jpg" alt="fig54-13" name="myfig54-13"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 54-13.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A pyramid of numbers.</span> In this pyramid of numbers for a bluegrass field in Michigan, only three top carnivores are supported in an ecosystem based on production by nearly 6 million plants.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para10"></a><p class="BlockText">The dynamics of energy flow through ecosystems have important implications for the human population. Eating meat is a relatively inefficient way of tapping photosynthetic production.
