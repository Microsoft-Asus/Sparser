MOSCOW --
After years of failed rocket launches , slashed funding , and a few near-fatal accidents , Friday , should be a banner day for Russia 's beleaguered space program .
Russia plans to launch the first stage of the world 's most ambitious space project ever , the $ 40 billion International Space Station , designed to replace the battered Mir orbital craft and form the basis of manned exploration of the heavens for the next two decades .
Financed primarily by the United States , Canada , Japan and 12 European countries , the project offers cash-strapped Russia a chance to revive its proud space program largely at someone else 's expense .
So why do Russian space officials look so glum ?
It appears that Russia looks askance at accepting for the first time what officials here see as a supporting role , one the Soviet Union never played when it put the first man in space and established records for longevity in orbit .
That feeling has Russian space officials calling to keep Mir in orbit , raising concerns that Moscow will not be able to muster the funds to meet its commitments to the new space station .
Those worries have cast a shadow on the launch , billed as the dawn of a new era of cosmic cooperation between the two main competitors in the Cold War -era space race .
Built in Russia and paid for by the United States , the first stage of the new station , the $ 238 million Zarya -LRB- `` Sunrise '' -RRB- module , will lift off from the Baikonur cosmodrome on the frozen steppes of Kazakhstan , 1,100 miles southeast of Moscow .
Zarya will be followed over the next six years by 45 launches carrying the 500-ton station into space and the record books .
When completed in 2004 , the station will be one of the brightest lights in the night sky .
It will provide for international science an orbiting laboratory the size of two football fields , the largest flying man-made object ever built .
Pieced together by space-walking astronauts and robot arms , it will be the most expensive and complicated peacetime construction project ever undertaken .
But as they tick off these superlatives , space agency officials from United States and other participating countries are crossing their fingers that the project does not turn into the world 's biggest cosmic headache .
Already , the project has been delayed by a year by Moscow 's inability to complete the third module , the living quarters of the station .
Recently , Russian space officials began appealing to keep the 12-year -old Mir in orbit despite previous agreements to ditch the aging craft in the Pacific Ocean next summer .
NASA officials play down their differences with Moscow .
But they make it clear that they expect Russia to stick with the plan to get rid of Mir. `` The Russians must decide if they can financially support two vehicles , '' said NASA spokesman Rob Navias .
`` We do n't believe they can , and we do n't think they believe they can . ''
Indeed , Yury Koptev , the head of Russia 's Space Agency , admitted this week that the Russian government had not delivered enough financing to keep Mir in space , much less fund the Russian commitments on the International Space Station .
Koptev has pushed for Russian involvement in the new station , which would mean up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years , as a way to revive the national space program .
But Koptev also wants to keep Mir flying .
`` Conserving Mir as a unique piece of long-life space equipment is possible and worthwhile , '' Koptev said .
`` Mir has a chance to survive .
To sink such wealth in the Pacific Ocean , as has been planned for 1999 , would be irrational . ''
A year ago , the idea of keeping Mir in space seemed irrational .
The aging station had barely survived a series of accidents that nearly destroyed it and its crew .
Once seen as the pride of the Russia space program for surviving more than double its expected life span of five years , Mir had become the butt of space-jalopy jokes everywhere , from the Russian media to the Hollywood film `` Armageddon . ''
Some Russian cosmonauts have dismissed the US demand to ditch Mir as a case of space envy .
Anatoly Solovyov , a top Russian cosmonaut who has flown five times on Mir , was asked this week why he thought Russia was being asked to shut down the Mir program .
`` It is clear why , '' Solovyov told Reuters .
`` Who has the station ?
We do . ''
Solovyov caused a stir last year when the Russian press quoted him as saying he would n't fly on the new space station under a less experienced American commander .
He later denied making the comments , but there is no denying that Russia rankles under the idea that the main mission control for the new station will be in Houston , not Moscow .
`` When the Americans suggested they control everything from Houston , we were not in agreement , '' Viktor Blagov , deputy flight controller at Russian mission control since Mir was launched in 1986 , told The Associated Press .
`` Why should we go there when we have everything here ? ''
