The eukaryotic cell evolved by "horizontal" fusions of species from different phylogenetic lineages. If the history of life is represented by an evolutionary tree, then the origin of eukaryotes would be depicted by cross-branches connecting the main branches of the tree. Trees, of course, aren’t like that. Our metaphor of an evolutionary tree, still useful for thinking about diversification within certain lineages such as the plant and animal kingdoms, starts to break down when it comes to the origin of eukaryotes and other very early evolutionary episodes. And now, researchers who are dissecting the chimeric makeup of the nuclear genome of eukaryotes may actually uproot the tree of life even more by changing our view of how eukaryotes are related to the two prokaryotic domains, Bacteria and Archaea. The key question is, What was the identity of the host cell that engulfed the ancestors of mitochondria during the origin of eukaryotes?</p><a name="para02"></a><p class="BlockText"><span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.6</span> reviews the conventional model of how the three domains are related (also see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 27.2</span>). This tree reflects molecular evidence that archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to prokaryotes. For example, archaea and eukaryotes have quite similar proteins functioning in the information-processing steps of transcription and translation (see Chapter 27). As such phylogenetic evidence accumulated, the case strengthened for the hypothesis that the host cell in the endosymbiotic origin of eukaryotes was derived from an early archaean.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-6','../fig/big/fig28-6.jpg','fig28-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-6.jpg" alt="fig28-6" name="myfig28-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Traditional hypothesis for how the three domains of life are related.</span> Tracing the domains back in time, the two prokaryotic branches converge on "LUCA," the last universal common ancestor.

The rest of the genome should be uniquely eukaryotic or derived from archaeal DNA via the host cell of the endosymbiotic scenario. Thus, systematists were surprised to find that the nuclear genome of eukaryotes includes many DNA sequences of bacterial origin that have nothing to do with the functions of mitochondria or plastids. The traditional diagram for the deepest branching of the tree of life also predicts that bacterial genes migrated only to the eukaryotic lineage, not to the branch giving rise to modern archaea. Another surprise: Modern archaea have many genes of bacterial origin. All three domains--Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya--seem to have genomes that are chimeric mixes of DNA that was transferred across the boundaries of the domains.</p><a name="para04"></a><p class="BlockText">Many researchers who are turning up these surprising relationships among the domains’ genomes suggest replacing the classical tree shown in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.6</span> with a weblike phylogeny like the one in <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 28.7</span>. The key departure from the traditional tree is the absence of a single ancestor common to the three domains (the "root" or "trunk" in the metaphor of an evolutionary tree). Instead, this new model has the three domains arising from an ancestral <span class="Emphasis1">community</span> of primitive cells that swapped DNA promiscuously. This would explain the chimeric nature of genomes in modern representatives of all three domains. Such gene transfer across species lines still occurs among prokaryotes (see Chapter 18). This doesn’t seem to be the case for modern eukaryotes. The chimeric makeup of the eukaryotic cell is a vestige of gene transfers and endosymbiotic events that occurred in prokaryotic communities over 2 billion years ago.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig28-7','../fig/big/fig28-7.jpg','fig28-7');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig28-7.jpg" alt="fig28-7" name="myfig28-7"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 28-7.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">An alternative hypothesis for how the three domains of life are related.</span> Based on evidence of extensive gene transfer between prokaryotic lineages today and throughout the past, this hypothesis replaces "LUCA" with an ancestral community of primitive cells that swapped genes. The diversity of organisms that evolved from that community consolidated into three main phylo genetic branches, the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. In the case of the endosymbiosis that gave rise to the mitochondria and chloroplasts, whole organisms of different evolutionary branches fused. However, most of the horizontal strands fusing with the vertical branches in this phylogeny symbolize the transfer of genes, not whole organisms, between different lineages.</span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
