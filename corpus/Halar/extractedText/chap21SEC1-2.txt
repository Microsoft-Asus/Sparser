DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION

 

 Different types of cells in an organism have the same DNA



 

 Different cell types make different proteins, usually as a result of transcriptional regulation



 

 Transcriptional regulation is directed by maternal molecules in the cytoplasm and signals from other cells



We have stated on several previous occasions that differences between cells in a multicellular organism come almost entirely from differences in geneexpression, not from differences in the cells' genomes. (There are a few exceptions, such as antibody-producing cells; seeFIGURE 19.6) Furthermore, we have mentioned that these differences arise during development, as regulatory mechanisms turn specific genes on and off. Let's now look at some of the evidence for this assertion.
