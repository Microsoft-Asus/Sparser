WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- CIA director George Tenet insisted Tuesday he took `` decisive action '' when faced with an investigation 's finding that former director John Deutch violated security by working on secret material at home .
His decision to strip his former boss of his security clearances proved that he acted properly , Tenet said .
He denied that the investigation was deliberately delayed , despite a CIA inquiry that suggested he and other top agency officials acted to slow down the process .
Details of the classified August 1999 report by the CIA 's inspector general were reported Tuesday by The New York Times .
In a statement , Tenet confirmed existence of the inspector general 's report but said he had acted appropriately .
`` The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done , decisive action was taken , and steps have been implemented to improve our security process , '' Tenet said .
CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look into the handling of the case .
The panel still is at work , Harlow said .
He said that while the internal investigation may not have proceeded as quickly as some would have liked , action was taken .
The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch 's access to classified information .
Deutch violated agency rules by keeping secret files on an unsecured computer at his home , the CIA said .
The matter comes against a backdrop of the government 's prosecution of Wen Ho Lee , a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist , on charges of mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes .
Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes .
Lee , who was not charged with espionage , is being held without bail .
Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are able to work on classified material at home , but stringent safeguards are in place involving their computers , including lockable hard drives , safes for depositing laptops when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet with secure computers .
At the White House , National Security Council spokesman David Leavy praised Tenet for taking `` strong , decisive and unprecedented action '' in the Deutch matter .
Leavy also said he sees no parallels to Lee 's case , and no double standard at work in the treatment of a top-ranking intelligence official .
`` The decision to punish Mr. Deutch was unprecedented , '' Leavy said during the regular White House briefing for reporters .
`` He had his security clearance revoked .
That is quite punitive for a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
'' Tenet goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday for an annual report on world threats , and the issue of security could come up .
Deutch , a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public service , was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996 .
When leaving his CIA post , agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that secrets were properly protected .
They found 31 classified documents on a CIA -issued computer not configured for work with secret documents .
In April 1999 the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Deutch but recommended that the CIA review his continued suitability to hold high-level security clearances .
Justice concluded Deutch 's security lapses were reckless rather than criminal .
Deutch apologized for his lapses .
The inspector general 's report `` did not conclude that anyone intentionally impeded the investigation , '' said Tenet , Deutch 's former deputy .
`` Had the IG any information to that effect , he would have had an obligation to refer the matter to the Justice Department .
He did not do so . ''
The Times story quoted Tenet as saying he had given directions for the investigation to proceed unimpeded .
The story did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating laws in their handling of the matter .
`` The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question , ` Can the CIA police itself ? '
The answer is that we can , and we did , '' Tenet said .
