Saudi Arabia 's oil minister Friday said any military activity in the Gulf can affect petroleum prices , but there is now such an oil glut that not even U.S. - British bombings of Iraq have had an impact .
`` There is too much oil on the market to worry about Iraq , '' Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters after meeting his Norwegian counterpart , Marit Arnstad .
Oil prices , depressed by overproduction amid a global economic crisis , have been at 12-year lows , costing exporting nations billions of dollars in revenue .
Saudi Arabia and Norway are the world 's two largest oil exporters .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Unlike Saudi Arabia , Norway is not a member of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , although it has voluntarily cut its production by about 3 percent to support OPEC 's drive to reduce supply and boost prices</ENAMEX> .
Naimi said he had not come to Norway to seek further cuts .
`` This is part of a continuous process of trying to understand what is happening in the oil market , '' Naimi said .
He came to Oslo directly from talks on Thursday with Venezuela and Mexico -- also major producers -- in Madrid .
Naimi said the Madrid meeting confirmed three main points : the commitment to maintain current cuts until June , a desire to extend cuts through next year , and a willingness to discuss further cuts in response to market conditions .
The minister said the three nations reached a `` soft consensus '' on the need for cuts by OPEC and non- OPEC oil exporters of up to 2 million barrels a day .
He said there are already excess stocks of 150-250 million barrels .
Arnstad , the Norwegian oil minister , said Naimi had not asked Norway for further cuts in production .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Earlier this week , Arnstad said Norway 's production will already be about 400,000 barrels per day below national budget projections for next year due to voluntary cuts and delays in some new oil fields starting production</ENAMEX> .
Norway currently produces about 3 million barrels of oil a day .
