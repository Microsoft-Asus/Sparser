NEW YORK
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Gov. George Pataki called today for a `` common sense '' series of gun control measures in New York , including mandatory trigger locks and the taking of ballistic `` fingerprints '' by manufacturers of all firearms marketed here .
Pataki said also called for the minimum age for handgun purchases in New York to go from 18 to 21 , for a ban on assault weapons and for instant background checks to be made of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows .
Pataki said at a news conference that while violent crime has fallen in New York , more New Yorkers are still being killed by guns than in car crashes .
`` That must change , '' he said .
Pataki called the ballistic fingerprinting of new firearms , dubbed by the governor the `` Gun DNA '' program , a centerpiece of his proposal .
`` The Gun DNA plan will provide police with an important tool that will give them a running start on their investigations , enabling them to catch violent criminals quicker , '' Pataki said .
The gun fingerprinting proposal calls for gun manufacturers , or the dealers who sell guns in New York , to transmit bullets and shell casings from every gun in their inventories to the State Police 's forensic lab .
Computerized images of bullets and shell casings would be kept on file and checked against bullets and casing recovered at the scenes of gun violence to help authorities track the weapons involved .
The barrels of guns leave telltale markings on bullets and shell casings .
Pataki 's proposal on background checks would close a loophole in the federal Brady Law which requires that guns sold by federally licensed firearms deals must be accompanied by a background check .
Sales at gun shows and flea markets , however , do not require such checks unless a federally licensed gun dealer is involved .
New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir appeared at Pataki 's news conference this morning and endorsed the Pataki proposals , as did Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro .
She is president of the state Association of District Attorneys .
`` It is time to deal with today 's reality and that is that more people die in the United States of gun injuries than any other place in the world , '' she said .
The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of bullet samples for the government , contending that it is a preliminary step toward national gun registration .
A spokesman for the NRA did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on Pataki 's legislation .
All the provisions the Republican governor will propose have been supported in the past in some form by the Democrat -dominated state Assembly in New York .
But the Republican state Senate , despite proposals from some of its majority members from New York City and its suburbs , has not approved any of the anti-gun measures .
John McArdle , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno , said Republicans have been `` looking '' at various gun provisions for years .
In some cases , Republicans have been trying to determine whether federal gun legislation would supersede what the Legislature could do on a state level , he said .
Senate Republicans have not been given details of Pataki 's impending legislation , McArdle said , but would review whatever the governor sent them .
Pataki said he knows his legislation would put him out of step with Republicans nationally , who generally oppose too-stringent anti-gun measures .
`` Ultimately if you think it 's the right thing you have to pursue it , '' he told ABC News Tuesday night .
`` I 'm hoping we can get this through the Legislature . ''
